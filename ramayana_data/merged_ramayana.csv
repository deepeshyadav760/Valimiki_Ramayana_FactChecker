Bala Kanda,1,89,"In the first chapter of Bala Kanda the gist of Ramayana is imbibed and it is called saMkshepa raamaayaNa, or also called baala raamaayaNa . The youngsters are asked to recite these stanzas daily for longevity and a perfect personality like that of Rama. The summarised stanzas reflected here are from the main epic. The canto-wise summarisation is as below:"
Bala Kanda,1,90,Valmiki composed Ramayana according to the letters of Gayatri Hymn and they are identified with the following verses in all cantos:
Bala Kanda,2,1,"Then, the great sage Valmiki, a skilled orator and a virtue-minded one, having heard those words of Narada, worshipped him along with disciples."
Bala Kanda,2,2,"That divine sage Narada being worshipped befittingly by Valmiki in that way, on seeking permission of Valmiki to leave and having been permitted by Valmiki, went away heaven-ward."
Bala Kanda,2,3,"Then, on Narada's going to the world of gods in a trice, that sage Valmiki went to the banks of Tamasa river not far from Jahnavi river."
Bala Kanda,2,4,"Then that sage Valmiki on reaching the shore of the clean Tamasa, and on beholding a ford of that river, spoke to his disciple who was at his side."
Bala Kanda,2,5,"""Oh! Bharadwaja, behold this ford which is without dirt, with clear waters and pleasant like a virtuous man's mind."
Bala Kanda,2,6,"""My dear! Let the hand-vessel [kamaNDalu] be kept [there]. Let my bark-garment be given to me. I will enter this best ford of Tamasa only..."
Bala Kanda,2,7,"Thus being said by the great-souled Valmiki, Bharadwaaja who was obedient to his Guru, gave the bark-garment to the sage"
Bala Kanda,2,8,"That self-controlled Sage Valmiki on taking bark-garment from his disciple's hands, and looking in all directions, indeed moved away from that wide expanse of forest."
Bala Kanda,2,9,"There holy sage Valmiki saw a couple of curlews, in the vicinity of that river's foreshore, flying there about in togetherness and cooing charmingly."
Bala Kanda,2,10,"A tribal hunter with evil intent, and a receptacle of enimity, killed the male one among the couple of birds, while Valmiki was looking on."
Bala Kanda,2,11,"The wife was moving together with husband with a red crest and with joy, with good wings, always being united with that male bird. On seeing that bird slain on ground reeling with blood covered wings really made wailing sounds with piteous utterances on being separated from her husband. [1-2-11, 12]"
Bala Kanda,2,13,"On seeing that bird felled that way by the tribal hunter, compassion occassioned in that saintly sage Valmiki."
Bala Kanda,2,14,"Then on seeing the wailing female krounchi bird, out of state of compassion and apperceiving the killing of male bird as unjust, the sage uttered this sentence..."
Bala Kanda,2,15,"""Oh! violent Hunter, by which reason you have killed one bird of the couple, when it was infatuated by passion, for that reason you will never get a state of rest for everlasting years to come..."""
Bala Kanda,2,16,"Thus speaking and pondering in his heart, he became thoughtful: ""What is this utterance by me in grief and anguish for this bird?""."
Bala Kanda,2,17,"That great wise one who was an intellectual and the best among sages, on cogitating, made up his mind and also spoke these words to the disciple..."
Bala Kanda,2,18,"""While I was tormented by grief, there arose a sentence consisting of four verses possessing metrically posited letters suitable to be played as song and string music and that will be called Shloka, not otherwise..."""
Bala Kanda,2,19,"Even the disciple happily received what that is articulated by the saint, a unique articulation, by which the saint too, became happy."
Bala Kanda,2,20,"Then that saint on performing his bathing in that ford according to custom, and still thinking on the purport of his utterance, he returned towards his hermitage."
Bala Kanda,2,21,"Then Bharadwaja, the obedient disciple and an erudite scholar, for he heard and learnt many scriptures by listening, on taking handy-vessel full with water followed at the behind of his mentor."
Bala Kanda,2,22,"He that knower of dharma, Valmiki, having entered the threshold of hermitage along with disciples, and having seated spoke about the day-to-day teachings and also other things, but he himself is preoccupied in cogitation on the verse."
Bala Kanda,2,23,"Then, the great resplendent Four-faced creator of fourteen worlds, almighty Brahma, arrived there on his own, to see that eminent saint Valmiki."
Bala Kanda,2,24,"Then that pious saint Valmiki is highly surprised on seeing Brahma, and on quickly getting up from his seat with his palms adjoined humbly, he stood aside, as he is spellbind."
Bala Kanda,2,25,"Valmiki venerated Brahma, on inquiring into his well-being, washed his feet, drenched his thirst, seated him to rest, and adored at best with customarily obeisance."
Bala Kanda,2,26,"Then god Brahma, who is seated on a high seat, very highly worshipped by Valmiki, also beckoned at Valmiki to take a seat."
Bala Kanda,2,26,"Even though Valmiki sat on his seat when duly permitted by Brahma, and though the Grandparent of the worlds is manifestly sitting before him, but the same broodings on those happenings occurred on that day have recurred on his mind. [1-2-27-28a]"
Bala Kanda,2,27,"""He that tribal hunter, who killed a cutely calling krounch bird for no good reason than intending to capture the kill, is an evil souled one that caused hardship..."" [1-2-28b-29a]"
Bala Kanda,2,28,"Remaining in melancholic mood Valmiki turned his mind to the depth of thinking, and again thinking only on the krouncha bird he sung the same verse, involuntarily. [1-2-29b-30a]"
Bala Kanda,2,29,"Then, Brahma smilingly spoke to that eminent saint Valmiki, ""But, what that is composed is a verse only... and there is no need to think through... [1-2-30b-31a]"
Bala Kanda,2,30,"""Oh, Brahman, that speech of yours sprang forth at my wish alone, hence oh, eminent sage, you shall render the legend of Rama, in its entirety... [1-2-31b-32a]"
Bala Kanda,2,31,"""You shall narrate the legend of Rama, the virtuous, intellectual and an intrepid one, and a godlike person in this world as well, as you have heard it from sage Narada. [1-2-32b-33a]"
Bala Kanda,2,32,"""The adventures of valorous Rama along with Lakshmana, and the misadventures of demons, known or unknown in every detail, and even the plight of Vaidehi which is either revealed or un-revealed so far, and whatever legend that has happened, all that will also be known to you, even if it were to be unknown, as yet... [1-2-33b-35a]"
Bala Kanda,2,33,"""You shall versify the heart pleasing and merit-yielding legend of Rama, and not a single word of yours will be unfounded in this epic... [1-2-35b-36a]"
Bala Kanda,2,34,"""As long as the mountains and even rivers flourish on the surface of the earth, so long the legend of Ramayana will flourish in this world... [1-2-36b-37a]"
Bala Kanda,2,37,"""And as long as Rama's legend authored by you flourishes...till then you will flourish in heavenly, in netherworlds, and even in my abode, namely Abode of Brahma..."
Bala Kanda,2,36,"On saying thus that Divinity Brahma vanished then and there only, and then that godly sage Valmiki came by astonishment, along with his disciples. [1-2-38b-c]"
Bala Kanda,2,39,"Then all of the disciples of Valmiki sang this verse time and again very delightedly, and muchstonished they also recited this verse, reciprocally."
Bala Kanda,2,40,"Equally lettered, four-footed is that verse when great Sage Valmiki articulated it, and when repetitively recited by one and all, it attained prominence as verse proper."
Bala Kanda,2,41,"Born is an intuition in that great sage and contemplated soul asserting that ""I will compose entire Ramayana, the epic, in suchlike verses...'"
Bala Kanda,2,42,"That celebrated sage and magnanimous seer Valmiki then authored the highly renowned Rama's legend extolling Rama's renown, with symmetrically worded verses, and words versified to yield meanings semantically, prosody free-flowing, and with hundreds of such verses."
Bala Kanda,2,43,"That epic contains uncomplicated compounds, conjunctions and conjugations, and has expressive sentences that are well knit and led evenly and sweetly, and that legend pertains to the best one from Raghu's dynasty, namely Rama, which also includes the extermination of the Ten headed evil named Ravana, and further, it is said by the sage, hence this may now be listenedâ¦"
Bala Kanda,3,1,"On hearing the essence of Ramayana from Sage Narada, which is abound with probity and prosperity, and a propitious one too, that virtue-souled Valmiki started searching for further known details in the legend of that dexterous Rama."
Bala Kanda,3,2,"Valmiki sitting on a sacred grass mat, whose apices are towards east, touched waters, and made his palms adjoined in reverence, and then by his yogic insight started to search comprehensively, for the narrative course of Ramayana."
Bala Kanda,3,3,"Of Rama, Lakshmana and Seetha, also of King Dasharatha and his wives, and what bechanced on Rama when he was in kingdom Ayodhya; Valmiki veritably discerned all that. Their smiles, their conversations, their deeds and the succession of events as well, all of them the sage saw wholly and clearly by the yogic power conferred by Brahma...] [1-3-3-4]"
Bala Kanda,3,5,"Then, that which bechanced on truth-abiding Rama, while he is trekking in forests, with a lady being the third partner, where Lakshmana is the lone male aide, Valmiki visualized all that."
Bala Kanda,3,6,"Then that virtue-souled sage saw what all that has happened earlier, by his yogic exaltation, as though it is a citric fruit in his own palm."
Bala Kanda,3,6,"Discerning all of Ramayana in its actuality by his yogic prowess that highly intellectual Valmiki pioneered to author all of the legend of Rama, for Rama is a delighter of all in all worlds, and whose legend is abounding with the real functional qualities of earthly pleasures and prosperities, and which clearly elaborates the meaning of probity and its operative qualities, and thus this legend is like an ocean replete with such gems called thoughts, and an ear-pleasing legend, as well. [1-3-7, 8]"
Bala Kanda,3,9,"That godly saint Valmiki composed the legend of Rama, the legatee of Raghu, exactly as the divine-soul Narada narrated it earlier."
Bala Kanda,3,10,"The birth of Rama as an incarnation of Vishnu, his very great valour, his gracefulness to all, his universal cordiality, perseverance, courteousness, and his truthful conduct, Valmiki described them all."

Bala Kanda,4,3,"Though that great scholar composed thus with leading and sequel legends, that godly saint thought over thus 'really, who will render all this ballad...'"

Bala Kanda,4,5,"Glorious Kusha and Lava are the virtue knowing princes, and they are endowed with melodious voice, besides being the residents of the same hermitage, thus Valmiki saw them saluting at his feet."
Bala Kanda,4,6,"On seeing that pair intellectuals who are proficient in Veda-s that self-reliant sage Valmiki made those two to memorize the epic, as the epic Ramayana is composed only to reinforce the import of Veda-s, as an ancillary."

Bala Kanda,4,12,"They the princes have memorized that virtue-expounding epic, the best; in its entirety and in doing so, they rendered that epic faultlessly."
Bala Kanda,4,13,"They sung the epic as schooled, well aware of its content and intent, among the assemblages of sages, scholars and also of eminent persons, with their best concentration"
Bala Kanda,4,14,"Once those two great-souls who endowed with musical talent and with all remarkable features, sung this epic, standing nearby the midst of a gathering of sages and pious souls. [1-4-14-15a]"
Bala Kanda,4,15,"On hearing that, the eyes of all the sages were overspread with tears of happiness, and they appreciated saying, 'splendid, splendid is this...' [1-4-15b-16a]"
Bala Kanda,4,16,"All those saints being the saint-patrons of virtue are pleased at heart, and praised the praiseworthy Kusha and Lava, while they are singing. [1-4-16b-17a]"
Bala Kanda,4,17,"""The melody of the ballad, especially the meaning of verses, aha! Superb... though this has happened long-ago it is shown like the one happening presently... [1-4-17b-18a]"
Bala Kanda,4,18,"""On getting into the mood of the epic, those two sang its import in one tune, that too melodiously and rapturously, marinating the pitch and tune..."" So said the saints. [1-4-18b-19a]"
Bala Kanda,4,19,"While the great saints of blessed ascesis are appreciating that way, those two melodiously sang very effectually and very meaningfully. [1-4-19b-20a]"
Bala Kanda,4,20,"And someone, a pleased saint, got up and bestowed a handy vessel to them... another reputed sage, lauding them contributed a jute robe. [1-4-20b-21a]"
Bala Kanda,4,21,"And another sage bestowed a black-deerskin, and like that yet another a sacred thread... someone gave a water-pot and another great saint a girdle of maunja grass to singers, while that way another contributed an under cloth; another sage gladly contributed a hatchet to them, another a saffron clothe, and yet another saint bestowed a cloth-wrapper; another delivered tuft-headband also, and another enchanted for their singing ballad handed out a sacrificial vessel, and another a bundle of firewood sticks, and yet another gave a plank-seat of audambari wood, and other called forth blessings, and someone then happily chanted bless-hymns for longevity... there by all the truth-avowing saints, those that are great sages have thus bestowed boons. [1-4-21b-26a]"
Bala Kanda,4,22,"""Surprising is this well-said rendering of Valmiki... it is the subsistence for tomorrow's poets... and this is completed sequentially, as well... [1-4-26b-27a]"
Bala Kanda,4,23,"While this song that generates longevity and prosperity, and one that is melodious one to all ears is being sung everywhere in streets and king's ways and while those two singers who are experts in singing any kind of music are being appreciated everywhere, Rama has seen them. [1-4-27b-29a]"
Bala Kanda,4,24,"Then on seeing them Rama, the enemy-eliminator, fetched those honour-worthy bothers, Lava and Kusha, to his palace and honoured them. [1-4-29b-30a]"
Bala Kanda,4,25,"He that king Rama is then surrounded by his ministers and brothers that are sitting his nearby, he himself sat on a divine golden throne. [1-4-3b-31a]"
Bala Kanda,4,26,"Having seen the mannerly brothers endowed with beautiful features, Rama spoke to Lakshmana, and Shatrughna, and Bharata likewise. [1-4-31b-32a]"
Bala Kanda,4,27,"Rama said to thus, ""Let this ballad be keenly heard from these divinely resplendent brothers, for it contains versatile words and meanings...' and thus he motivated the singers. [1-4-32b-33a]"
Bala Kanda,4,28,"Even those two singers have sung the ballad melodiously and effectually, with their clear and clarified voices, like the melody of string and rhythmic instruments, with very clear and meaningful intonation. [1-4-33b-c]"
Bala Kanda,4,34,"Enthralling courtier's bodies, minds and hearts also, and thus that song sone forth as it is for all ears, bearing a comfort in its manifestation, among the gathering of the people."
Bala Kanda,4,35,"""These two saint-like Kusha and Lava, who also possess kingly features, but they are great hermits... this narration is endowing good fortune to me also, listen to that great efficacious legend [of Seetha...]"" [So said Rama to those courtiers.]"
Bala Kanda,4,36,"Then those two singers, motivated by Rama's words, sang the ballad in maarga system, for they are well versed in it, then even Rama, who is also in the congregation, again to pacify his mind, [for the story of Seetha puts his mind to turmoil,] became interested at heart [to continue listening Seetha's story...]"
Bala Kanda,5,1,"Once upon a time, under which victorious kings, starting from Prajapatithi-s, this entire earth with all its islands is there, among which kings one king named Sagara is there, well-known for his deepening the oceans, and whom his sixty thousand sons were fencing in when he is set out for action, in the dynasty of such Ikshvaku kings this highly revered and reputed epic Ramayana is originated. [1-5-1, 3]"
Bala Kanda,5,4,"Being such a legend, we two wish to relate this Ramayana entirely and completely from the beginning, which is endowed with the values and means of probity, prosperity, and pleasure seeking... and this be listened without any caviling."
Bala Kanda,5,5,"A great kingdom named Kosala, a joyous and a vast one well flourishing with monies and cereals, is snugly situated on the riverbanks of Sarayu."
Bala Kanda,5,6,"A world-renowned city is there in that kingdom, which is personally built by Manu, the foremost ruler of mankind."
Bala Kanda,5,7,That glorious city with well-devised highways is twelve yojana-s lengthwise and three yojana-s breadth wise.
Bala Kanda,5,8,"That city shines forth with well-laid great royal highways that are always wetted with water, and with flowers strewn and scattered on them."
Bala Kanda,5,9,"As an improver of great kingdom Dasharatha the king made her as his abode, as Indra made heavens as his abode."
Bala Kanda,5,10,"That city is surrounded with gateways and archways; the front yards of buildings are well laid; it is lodges all kinds of machinery, weaponry and craftsmen, and king Dasharatha dwells in such a city."
Bala Kanda,5,11,"She that prosperous city Ayodhya is muchly crammed with many a eulogist and panej~nrist, yet she is highly splendorous with many a bastion, flag and hundreds of batteries of canons, and Dasharatha dwells therein."
Bala Kanda,5,12,"That city Ayodhya accommodates groups of danseuses and theatrical personnel, and she is surrounded everywhere with the gardens and brakes of mango trees, and her wide fort-wall is like her cincture ornament."
Bala Kanda,5,13,"That Ayodhya is an impassable one for trespassers, or for others invaders, owing to her impassable and profound moats, and she is abounding with horses, camels, likewise with cows and donkeys."
Bala Kanda,5,14,"With the throngs of provincial kings who come hither to pay dues pervade that city, and she is verily lustrous with residents of various other countries, and with traders, too. In such a city Dasharatha dwells."
Bala Kanda,5,15,"Buildings are ornamentally studded with precious gems, and with such multi-storied sky scrappers she is adorned, and filled with them she is like Amaravati, the capital of Indra."
Bala Kanda,5,16,"Amazing is Ayodhya for its lay-out is like a game board called aSTapadi, and with its flocks of beautiful women moving thereabout, where all kinds of precious gems are heaped up, and where its seven storied buildings are picturesque."
Bala Kanda,5,17,"The housing is very dense and there is no place or ground unutilized, and all are constructed on well-levelled lands, and rice-grain is plentiful while the drinking water tastes like sugar cane juice."
Bala Kanda,5,18,"That city is sounding with the drumbeats of great drums, and with musical rhythm instruments like mridnga, cymbals, and with string instruments like Veena etc., and on earth she is uniquely the best city."
Bala Kanda,5,19,"Ayodhya is like a hovering space station attained by sages by their ascesis, and its edifices are well planned and it is teeming with best people."
Bala Kanda,5,20,"They the skilful archers of that Ayodhya will not kill a lone one with their arrows, one that does not have either a predecessor or a successor in his family, a fleeing one, or by listening to the sound of the target, as is done in sonic-archery, and their skills, acumen and handiness are thus benevolent."
Bala Kanda,5,21,"They kill the fattened and roaring lions, tigers and wild boars with the might of their sharp weaponry, or even with the might of their own arms alone."
Bala Kanda,5,22,"With that kind of thousands of archers, and with speediest chariot-warriors she that Ayodhya is filled with, and King Dasharatha made his abode in such a city."
Bala Kanda,5,23,"She that Ayodhya is encompassed with Vedic scholars who always worship the ritual fire by enkindling the three kinds of ritual-fires continuously, virtuous Brahman scholars in Veda-s and their six ancillary subjects, and other great souls that are in similitude with great saints, and who are just like sages that are charitable donors, and that abide by the truth."
Bala Kanda,6,1,"He who is well-versed in Veda-s, who is a gatherer of all scholars, riches and forces as well, a foreseer and a great resplendent one, also one who is esteemed by urbanites and countrymen alike, one who is a top-speeded chariot-warrior aamong the emperors of Ikshwaku kings, one who has performed many Vedic rituals, a virtuous one, a great controller, a saint-like kingly sage, one who he is renowned in all the three worlds, a mighty one with all his enemies eradicated, nevertheless who has friends, one who conquered all his senses, one who is similar to Indra, or Kubera on earth with his wealth, accumulations and other possessions, he that king Dasharatha while dwelling in the city of Ayodhya protected the world, like Manu, the foremost protector of mankind. [1-6-3,4,5]"
Bala Kanda,6,5,"He that truth-abiding king, who adheres to the three-fold virtues rules the vast of that kingdom from that best city Ayodhya, as Indra rules heaven from his capital Amaravati."
Bala Kanda,6,6,"In that best city Ayodhya all are exuberant yet virtuous ones, and scholars are variously learned ones, people are satisfied with their own riches, they have no greed, and they advocate truthfulness alone."
Bala Kanda,6,7,"None with meagre accumulations is there in that great city and no householder is there without unearned means, and without cows, horses, monies or cereals and who could not sustain his family."
Bala Kanda,6,8,"None can see a lustful person, or a miser or a cruel one anywhere in that Ayodhya, along with nondescripts or non-believers, for there are no such persons."
Bala Kanda,6,9,"All the ladies and gentlemen in that city are virtuous in mind, self-controlled ones, they are all self-satisfied like great saints, and both in their conduct and character they are blameless."
Bala Kanda,6,10,"In that city none is there without his earrings, headgear, or garlands, none is an enjoyer of lowly things, or misses his regular oil-baths, or with an un-creamed body with sandalwood paste or with other body cream, or with an un-perfumed physique."
Bala Kanda,6,11,"There is none who is famsihed, an uncharitable one in his nature, one with an undecorated body with ornaments like bracelets or chest plates, and there is none without a heart."
Bala Kanda,6,12,"There is none someone who is without sacrificial fires, and none without performing sacrificial rituals, and none is low in living; neither an immoral, nor a bastard nor even a thief, can be found in Ayodhya."

Bala Kanda,6,14,"There is no atheist, no liar, and none is less learnt in Veda-s, and no one is found to be jealous, or disabled, or unscholarly person."
Bala Kanda,6,15,"None can be found anywhere in Ayodhya without the knowledge of the six ancillaries of Veda-s like astrology, prosody, grammar etc., none a non-performer of the prescribed rituals, and none a non-donor in thousands, thus none with a saddened heart, turmoil in mind or agonised in will is there."
Bala Kanda,6,16,"Whoever it may be, either a gentleman or a lady, none is without wealth, even none without elegance or devoid of devotion to their king, and it is impossible to see suchlike person in Ayodhya."
Bala Kanda,6,17,"In the four-caste system, from the first caste to the last, everyone is a worshipper of deities and guests and everyone is also faithful, illustrious, valiant, and each one is a brave one."
Bala Kanda,6,18,"Longevity is there for all of the people, all are with virtuosity and truthfulness, and they lived in that best city along with their sons, grandsons and their ladies."
Bala Kanda,6,19,"The warrior class Kshatriya-s is turned towards the Brahmans, the scholarly class, for intellectual and religious support. The trading class, Vyasya-s, is the follower of the Kshatriya-s, the ruling class, for the state's economy is dependent on the rulership. And the fourth one, Shuudra-s, the working class, while performing its own duties, is always working for the other castes."
Bala Kanda,6,20,"That city is well protected by that king from Ikshwaku dynasty namely Dasharatha, like Manu, the foremost king of mankind in earlier times."
Bala Kanda,6,21,"That city Ayodhya is replete with firebrand like skillful warriors that are intolerant of insults, and who have prosecuted their education in archery, chariot-wars, swordplay etc. and with them it is like a cave replete with lions."
Bala Kanda,6,22,"That city is full with best horses born in countries like Kaambhoja, Baahlika, Vanaayu, and also in river-bed counties, which are like the horse of Indra namely ucChiashrava."
Bala Kanda,6,23,"Born in Vindhya Mountains, and also from Himalayan regions, mighty are the elephants fully vigorous and fattened ones, and most powerful in their strength and each in similitude is a huge mountain."
Bala Kanda,6,24,"High bred from the classes of Iravata, the Elephant of Lord Indra, and from Mahapadma, Anjana and Vamana, too...are the elephants [of that city]"
Bala Kanda,6,22,"That city is always full with vigorous and mountain like elephants bred mainly from three classes viz., Bhadra, Mandra and Mriga. And inter-bred among these three main classes are Bhadra-Mandra, Mandra-Mriga, Bhadra-Mriga and the like. [1-6-25-26a]"
Bala Kanda,6,26,"While residing in which city King Dasharatha ruled the world that city is further fortified up to two more yojana-s outside city, true to its name a yodhya , an un-assailable one."
Bala Kanda,6,27,"In which city the great resplendent and admirable king Dasharatha resided, he ruled the world from that city with silenced enemies, like the moon governing the stars."
Bala Kanda,6,28,"With gorgeous arches, castle-door-bars and with amazingly built houses that city is magnificent and auspicious one, and full with thousands of provincial kings too, and king Dasharatha, a coequal of Indra, indeed ruled that city which is true to its name."
Bala Kanda,7,1,"The misters for the great soul from Ikshvaku kings of Emperor Dasharatha, are epitomised ones of their tactfulness, adroitness and are always obliged to undertake welfare activities of their king and the kingdom."
Bala Kanda,7,2,"Eight ministers are there for that valiant and glorious King Dasharatha, who are clean at heart and are involved in the works of the king and kingdom at all time."
Bala Kanda,7,3,"Dhristi, Jayantha, Vijaya, Suraashtra, Raashtravardhana, Akopa, Dharmapaala, are seven, and Sumantra is the eighth one."
Bala Kanda,7,4,"Two venerable saints of eminence are religious ministers for they are authorities in Vedic rituals, namely Vashishta and Vamadeva, who are the acquiescent with religious matters, and apart from these two some more religious ministers are also there to King Dasharatha."
Bala Kanda,7,5,"Suyajna, Jabaali, Kaashyapa, Gautama, Maarkandeya, Deerghaayu, and then Kaatyayana are the scholarly Brahmans acting as religious ministers, and along with them there are also Brahma-sages who are always the ancestral ritual scholars for Dasharatha's family. [1-7-5, 6a]"
Bala Kanda,7,6,"All the ministers are well versed in scriptures, they shun bad deeds, skilful ones in their duties with their senses regulated. Those great souls are affluent, knowers of all sciences, firmly courageous, and they are distinguished and quiet-souls, and those ministers are true to their word. They are magnificent, patient and famed ones and they smile afore they converse. [1-7-6b, 8a]"
Bala Kanda,7,7,"They never speak untruthful words in anger or in greed or for monetary reasons either. There is nothing unknown to them, even a little, in their own country or in the others either, or about everything that is happening or has happened, or that is going to happen, for they know them through agents. [1-7-8b, 9]"
Bala Kanda,7,10,"They are efficient in administration and their friendships are well examined by the king, and those ministers impose punishment even on their own sons, if situation demands it."
Bala Kanda,7,11,"In collections to their treasury and to militarise their armies they are dutiful, even an unfriendly person will not be tortured, if he were not really blameworthy."
Bala Kanda,7,12,"They are valiant ones with engineered enthusiasm, administrators of political science, clean persons and protectors of subjects of their kingdom at all times."
Bala Kanda,7,13,"They do not persecute Brahman-s and Kshatriya-s to fill-up the treasury, and high degree punishments will be given on assessing that person's, or the offender's strength and weakness."
Bala Kanda,7,14,"All of those ministers are clean administrators of kingdom, and are in league with each other, as such there is none anywhere, either in capital or in country, a liar."
Bala Kanda,7,15,"None with an evil-mind or with an interest in other man's wife is there, and thus on whole in the kingdom and also like that in the capital, there is an undisturbed society."
Bala Kanda,7,16,"Well-dressed and well-decorated and they the ministers of King Dasharatha, observe decency in the interest of the king and also of the kingdom, with diligence and with a truthful-eye."
Bala Kanda,7,17,"They acquired good qualities from their mentors and they are renowned by their expertise, and even in foreign countries they are famous for their intellectual determinations in all affairs."
Bala Kanda,7,18,"Versatile and virtuous are they the ministers and there is none who discarded his virtuosity, and they are the determiners of truce or war, and by their nature they possess opulence."
Bala Kanda,7,19,"They are capable to keep up the confidentialities of strategies, and also capable to apply their mind even in micro-affairs, and they know moral science comprehensively, and above all, they are gentle articulators."
Bala Kanda,7,20,Accompanied with such of those effectual and good-natured ministers the exalted king Dasharatha ruled the earth.
Bala Kanda,7,19,"He that most generous one among men, Dasharatha, while observing through spies, and to protect people righteously, and to give a good governance to them, he forsook unrighteousness and became a generous king avowed to truthfulness alone, and thus he that Dasharatha ruled the earth, which rulership is renowned in all the three worlds. [1-7-21,22]"
Bala Kanda,7,23,"Emperor Dasharatha has not encountered either a superior or an equal in his kingship, and to him there are many friends, subdued are his provincial kings and eliminated is thorniness by his own valour. He thus ruled the world like Indra would in Heaven."
Bala Kanda,7,24,"In the company of those ministers, who are conducive to the strategies, interested in the king and subjects as well, skilful and efficient ones, he that King Dasharatha obtained brilliance, like the rising Sun along with resplendent sunrays."
Bala Kanda,8,1,"To him, to such an effectual and virtuously great-souled King Dasharatha, , a dynasty-enriching son is not begotten though his heart is burning to beget children."
Bala Kanda,8,2,"To that anguished great-soul, a thought occurred this way, ""To beget sons, why should not I perform Horse ritual...[and thus appease the gods in order to beget worthy sons...""]"
Bala Kanda,8,3,"That intellectual and a conscientious king having resolved with all of his sagacious ministers that such a Vedic ritual is performable, then addressed best ne among ministers, namely Sumantra, ""fetch all my teachers and clerics, quickly.."" [1-8-3,4]"
Bala Kanda,8,4,"Then Sumantra gone quickly, for he in quickness is a dauntless one, and fetched all of the clerics like Suyajna, Vaama Deva, Jaabala, Kshyapa, and even Sage Vashishta, and also those other eminent Brahman that are Vedic scholars. [1-8-5,6]"
Bala Kanda,8,7,Then on adoring them virtuous King Dasharatha spoke this impressible sentence that included justification and meaning.
Bala Kanda,8,8,"""My mind is tumultuous without quietude for I have no sons... for that reason, I wish perform Aswametha, Vedic Horse Ritual... this is my thinking..."
Bala Kanda,8,9,"""Therefore, I contemplate to perform that ritual as enshrined in the scriptures and as a rite-oriented one as well... let this contemplation of mine be well thought of... and as to how my desire to beget sons will be fulfilled..."
Bala Kanda,8,10,"Then the Brahman scholars along with Sage Vashishta and all other important personalities in their turn have blessed and honoured him, saying that ""splendid is this idea..."" thus, for that which is voiced by the king."
Bala Kanda,8,11,"All of them becoming happy have also said to King Dasharatha, ""let the paraphernalia be provided, and your ritual-horse be released..."
Bala Kanda,8,10,"""Oh, king, by all means you will beget sons as you desired, since you, to whom an upright thinking has suggested itself... let the ritual ground be arranged on the northern banks of River Sarayu..."" So said the scholars. [1-8-12, 13a]"
Bala Kanda,8,11,""" Then King Dasharatha is gladdened on hearing the sayings of those Brahmans. And with happiness lurching on his eyes the king spoke to the ministers, ""As advised by my Vedic teachers let the paraphernalia be procured... [1-8-13b, 14]"
Bala Kanda,8,15,"""On the northern banks of River Sarayu the ritual ground be arranged... and the Ritual-Horse be released monitored by capable warriors, along with the religious teachers..."" So said the king."

They roughly compare with the following Gregorian months as below:"
Bala Kanda,13,1,"On completion of one full year another springtime arrived, and then Dasharatha a determined one to beget progeny by performing Horse Ritual entered the ritual hall."
Bala Kanda,13,2,Greeting and even adoring the Sage Vashishta customarily Dasharatha said these very humble words to him.
Bala Kanda,13,3,"""Let my ritual be performed scripturally, oh eminent Brahman, let it be conducted in such a way that no obstacle occurs even in its ancillary functions."
Bala Kanda,13,4,"""You being my very reverent royal priest are friendly and kind-hearted to me, and you alone shall shoulder the burden of the commenced ritual in all good faith and credence."

So also the actors and dancers are summoned. Thus flawless scholars in scriptures and those men who are well read in Veda-s, are called and he addressed them saying, ""Performance of the ritual be organised by the order of the king. Bricks in many thousands be brought quickly and royal palaces as temporary guesthouses be built for the kingly guests, with very many facilities included in them. [1-13-6,7,8,9]"

Bala Kanda,13,38,"""All the desirable paraphernalia is arranged and made available everywhere, and it is apt of you see ritual hall that is as though built by your mere wish."
Bala Kanda,13,39,"Thus, on a good day while the ruling star of the day is favourable, King Dasharatha came forth towards the ritual hall according to the advice of both the sages Vashishta and Rishyasringa."
Bala Kanda,13,40,"Then Sage Vashishta and other eminent Brahmans keeping the Sage Rishyasringa ahead of them entered the ritual hall, to commence the ritual works thus."
Bala Kanda,13,41,"When all have entered the ritual hall as per canons and custom, that glorious king Dasharatha along with his wives undertook vow of ritual."
Bala Kanda,14,1,"Then after completion of one year and on regaining the ritual horse, the Emperor Dasharatha commenced his Vedic Ritual on the northern banks of River Sarayu."
Bala Kanda,14,2,"Keeping Rishyasringa at the helm of affairs those eminent Brahmans commenced, ashva medha , the Horse-ritual of that noble-souled Dasharatha."
Bala Kanda,14,3,"Those well-versed conductors of Vedic rituals called ritviks , have started to perform works relating to ritual as per canon and rules, and conducted them scripturally and customarily."
Bala Kanda,14,4,"On performing pravargya ritual as per scriptures, like that upasada ritual too, those Brahmans have customarily performed all of those other rituals incidental to the main one scripturally."
Bala Kanda,14,5,"Then all of those distinguished sages are contended with what they have performed by worshipping gods already summoned, they also conducted early morning savana ritual and its ancillaries as enjoined."
Bala Kanda,14,6,"The oblations addressed to Indra are well given as ordained, and the flawless king Dasharatha also crushed the Soma creeper to squeeze Soma juice, and thus the mid-day savana ritual has come to pass according to sequence."
Bala Kanda,14,7,"Like that those proficient Brahmans have also performed the third savana , ritual of that great-exalted soul Dasharatha according to the viewpoint of scriptures."
Bala Kanda,14,8,Rishyasringa and other best scholars with their well lettered and intonated Vedic hymns have invoked Indra and other gods to that place.
Bala Kanda,14,9,"The hotaa -s, invocators, have welcomed the celestials for partaking oblations by singing saama Veda hymns sweetly and harmoniously, and on inviting them with Vedic hymns they have offered oblations to them."
Bala Kanda,14,10,There is no unburnt oblation resulted in that fire-ritual nor even a small mishap slipped in the performance of ritual. Everything appeared canonically correct and hymn oriented. Indeed the ritual is performed in a secure way.
Bala Kanda,14,11,"In these days of ritual none found there to be weary or hungry, and there is no single unscholarly person, nor any Brahman without at least a hundred apprentices."
Bala Kanda,14,12,"Given anytime the Brahmans, servants, sages, and pilgrims are fed with food for their arrival at the place of boarding is unpredictable, and that arrival is dependent on their duties for Brahmans, and by their masters for servants, and for pilgrims that do not have a particular time of arrival or departure."
Bala Kanda,14,13,"Elderly people, sick ones, women and children though dining on always thus, no satisfaction to complete the meal is attained for themselves, as the food served is that pleasant."
Bala Kanda,14,13,"Elderly people, sick ones, women and children though dining on always thus, there is no satisfaction to Emperor Dasharatha, for it appeared to be too meagre a serving and a lot more is to be served.]"
Bala Kanda,14,14,"""Food be given abundantly, clothing be given variously"" are the directives, accordingly the king's men have distributed numerously there at the ritual place."
Bala Kanda,14,15,"Heaps of foodstuffs are also appearing there, many of them and mountain similar, which is made available customarily, day after day."
Bala Kanda,14,16,"To that ritual of that great-souled Dasharatha masses of men and women have arrived from different countries, and they are all well-pleased with the sumptuous food and drink supplied."
Bala Kanda,14,17,"""The eminent Brahmans have appreciated the food that is prepared by perfect cooking to be relishable, and it is heard as they said, ""oh, Raghava, blessed are you for we are satisfied..."""
Bala Kanda,14,18,"Well-decorated men have served food to Brahmans, while others who wore gem-studded and lustrous earrings have helped them."
Bala Kanda,14,19,"Those eminent Brahmans that are good debaters have debated many intellectual debates to defeat each other, during the gap-periods of ritual works."
Bala Kanda,14,20,"Day by day those expert Brahmans have performed all ritual works as encouraged by Vashishta, and others and as contained in scriptures."
Bala Kanda,14,21,"There is no scholar without the knowledge of the six branches of Vedas, none who is an unavowed scholar, none who heard learnt less scriptures, and none among the members of the ritual of that king Dasharatha is an inexpert in debating, thus all are scholarly Brahmans."
Bala Kanda,14,23,"When the time came to stake wooden ritual posts, six posts of bilwa wood, six posts of khadira wood, and further the same number of posts of parnina wood are staked. One post of sleshmaataka wood and two of devadaaru wood as stipulated are staked. Then the distance between each post is maintained at the length of extended arms. [1-14-22,23]"
Bala Kanda,14,24,"All of those the posts are made by the authorities on scriptures and ritual scholars, and they are gold-pleated and decorated for the purpose of elegance to that ritual."
Bala Kanda,14,25,"They are altogether twenty-one posts, each post is twenty-one cubits in height, and each is decoratively clothed with each cloth."
Bala Kanda,14,26,"Carpenters have carved all the posts well, and built them strongly with octahedral surfaces that are smoothened, and thereby they are implanted procedurally."
Bala Kanda,14,27,"Those posts draped in cloths and worshipped with flowers and perfumery are irradiant, and they shone forth like the constellation of Seven Sages in the sky."
Bala Kanda,14,28,"The bricks for Altar of Fire are well designed and made according to rules and standard measurements. The Brahmans who are experts in the architecture of laying Fire Altar, by calculating the ritual field with a one-ply rope and decide where and how the that shall be, the Altar of Fire is layered well with bricks in that ritual."
Bala Kanda,14,29,"That Altar of Fire of that King, the Lion, is layered by expert Brahmans in the shape of an eagle with golden wings, with its size being three folds bigger than the altars of other rituals, thus it has eighteen separators, and fire is laid on it."
Bala Kanda,14,30,"In that ritual animals, serpents and birds designated to such and such deities are readied according to the scriptural directives."
Bala Kanda,14,31,"The sages have arranged those animals that are to be there in animal sacrifices, like horse and other aquatic animals, in that ritual according to scriptures."
Bala Kanda,14,32,"Three hundred animals are tied to the ritual posts, along with the gemlike best ritual horse of that King Dasharatha."
Bala Kanda,14,33,"With great delight coming on her Queen Kausalya reverently made circumambulations to the horse, and symbolically killed the horse with three knives."
Bala Kanda,14,34,Queen Kausalya desiring the results of ritual disconcertedly resided one night with that horse that flew away like a bird.
Bala Kanda,14,35,"Thus, the officiating priests of the ritual, namely hota, adhwaryu and udgaata have received in their hand the Crowned Queen, the neglected wife, and a concubine of the king, next as a symbolic donation in the ritual by the performer, the king."
Bala Kanda,14,36,"Then the priest, one with controlled senses and rich in scriptural wealth, took up the omentum [fat] of the horse and cooked it as per scriptures while dropping into the altar of fire to bake as a food to the celestials."
Bala Kanda,14,37,The king Dasharatha smelt the smell of smoke as per time and procedure to cleanse his own sin.
Bala Kanda,14,38,"Those remaining body parts that horse are there, the sixteen officiating priests have procedurally oblated all of them into fire."
Bala Kanda,14,39,"In other rituals the oblations will be offered into sacrificial fire with spoon-like sticks of plaksha tree, but in Horse-sacrifice ritual they are offered through the vetasa creeper, a rattan plant, cane."
Bala Kanda,14,40,"The Horse Ritual is to be performed for three days as laid down in kalpa sutra-s, the rules governing such rituals, and by brahmaNa-s, the penultimate parts of Veda-s, and the one performed on the first day is called chatuhSToma ritual."
Bala Kanda,14,41,"The ritual on the second day is called ukthyam , and the next one performed on third day is called atiraatra. These apart many of the preordained rituals are performed there in that ritual as envisaged in scriptures."
Bala Kanda,14,42,"The rituals called jyothiSToma, aayuSi, and atiraatra rituals are performed. And also rituals of great kind like abhijit, vishwajit, aptoryaama are performed."
Bala Kanda,14,43,"As the promoter of his own dynasty that king Dasharatha donated eastern side to hota, western to adhvaryu, and southern to brahma. And to udgaata northern side is given in donation. These were the donations stipulated in that great ritual, ashwamedha, by the Self-Created Brahma from earlier times. [1-14-44,43]"
Bala Kanda,14,45,"On completing the ritual thus that best man Dasharatha justifiably donated those lands to the officiating priests, called ritwiks, to promote of his dynasty."
Bala Kanda,14,46,"Thus on giving away the vast expanses of his kingdom he that glorious one born in Ikshvaku dynasty is gladdened, but all the officiating priests said to the king who by now is rid of his sins."
Bala Kanda,14,47,"""You alone are capable to protect the earth in its entirety, and there is no use for us with these lands, and we are not capable to rule it, either."" Thus the priests are addressing the king."
Bala Kanda,14,48,"""We are always preoccupied with self-study and teaching of scriptures, oh, king, thus you may give us something else in barter, any modest thing. """
Bala Kanda,14,49,"""Let best gems, gold, or cows or anything else that is available you may give us, what is the use of these vast expanses to us."" So said the scholars."
Bala Kanda,14,49,"The king Dasharatha, the lord of people, thus requested by the scholarly Vedic Brahmans gave them millions of cows, ten of ten million gold coins, and the silver four times thereof. [1-14-50, 51a]"
Bala Kanda,14,50,"Then all those officiating priests collectively gave that wealth to sage Rishyasringa and to the enlightened sage Vashishta. [1-14-51b, 52a]"
Bala Kanda,14,51,"Then all of those Brahmans are well satisfied at heart and distributed among themselves the wealth passed on by Rishyasringa and Vashishta, and then they said, ""We are highly gladdened."" [1-14-52a, 53a]"
Bala Kanda,14,52,"Then to the other Brahmans who arrived there to see the ritual, King Dasharatha sincerly donated ten million gold coins. [1-14-53b, 54a]"
Bala Kanda,14,53,"That descendent of Raghava dynasty gave an excellent hand ornament to someone who is an impoverished Brahman and who is beseeching. [1-14-54a, 55a]"
Bala Kanda,14,54,"While those Brahmans are becoming happy then that king and the patron of Brahmans venerated them dutifully with his senses fluttering with happiness. [1-14-55b, 56a]"
Bala Kanda,14,55,"Then that benevolent and valiant King Dasharatha prostrated on ground venerating the Brahmans, and the Brahmans too chanted various blessing hymns on that prostrating king. [1-14-56b, 57a]"
Bala Kanda,14,56,"Then that king is gladdened at heart for the successful achievement of the completion of that excellent ritual that removes sin and that leads to heaven as well, and that which cannot be undertaken by many of the best kings. [1-14-57b, 58a]"
Bala Kanda,14,57,"Thereafter king Dasharatha said to sage Rishyasringa thus, ""oh, sage with best vows, you alone are eligible to perform the ritual for the expansion of my dynasty."" [1-14-58b, 59a]"
Bala Kanda,14,58,"That best Brahman Rishyasringa saying yes to the proposal, said this to king Dasharatha, ""oh, king, there will be four sons to you that ennoble your dynasty. [1-14-59b, c]"
Bala Kanda,14,60,"On hearing the sweet words of Sage Rishyasringa, he that king of kings Dasharatha went into a state of ecstasy and venerating that great soul, Rishyasringa, again said this to him."
Bala Kanda,15,1,"That intellectual sage and one proficient in Veda-s Rishyasringa contemplated for a while, and gaining indications as to which ritual is to be performed, then said the king."
Bala Kanda,15,2,"""I will procedurally conduct the ritual contained in the preamble of adharva-veda with procedural hymns, called putra kaameSTi i.e., the ritual that bestows sons, for your benefit."""
Bala Kanda,15,3,"Then that resplendent Sage Rishyasringa commenced that putrakaameSTi ritual, offering oblations into sacred fire with ritual acts meticulously contained in hymns."
Bala Kanda,15,4,"Then the deities along with celestial beings, siddha-s, i.e., the souls that obtained salvation, and also other esteemed sages who by now are the residents of Heavens have duteously assembled in the firmament to receive their part of the oblations."
Bala Kanda,15,5,"Those deities who procedurally assembled there in that congregation then spoke to Brahma, the creator of worlds."
Bala Kanda,15,6,"""Oh! God, the demon named Ravana is torturing all of us with his intrepidity, as you have blessed him, and we are unable to control him."
Bala Kanda,15,7,"""You have given boon to him appreciating his ascesis and oh, god, with high regard to that boon of yours we are tolerating all the cruel acts of Ravana from then onwards"
Bala Kanda,15,8,"""That malevolent Ravana is tormenting all the three worlds, hating the functionary deities of cosmos, and always desires to assail Indra, the king of all the functionary deities of universe."
Bala Kanda,15,9,"""That invincible one is further self-conceited by the boons you have accorded, and he is overbearingly torturing the sages, celestial beings like yaksha-s, gandharva-s, asura-s, and like that even the Brahmans."
Bala Kanda,15,10,"""The Sun-god will not verily parch Ravana, the Air-god will not puff at his sides, and on seeing Ravana, the lord of the undulating waves, namly the ocean will not pulsate either."
Bala Kanda,15,11,"""Thereby, there is a great panic for all of us from that demon with an awesome look, hence oh, god, it will be apt of you to give a thought for his elimination."
Bala Kanda,15,12,"When all the deities spoke to Brahma thus, he thought for a while and then said ""Aha! The idea to kill that evil-minded Ravana is discerned."
Bala Kanda,15,13,"""Ravana said while seeking boon that, 'I shall not be killed by gandharva-s, yaksha-s, or by gods, or by other demons...' and I also said 'so be it..."""
Bala Kanda,15,14,"""That demon did not express about humans then with his disrespect to them, and evidently his death does not occur otherwise."" So said Brahma to gods."
Bala Kanda,15,15,"On hearing Brahmathe explaining himself , then all those gods and great sages became adequately happy."
Bala Kanda,15,16,"In the meanwhile the great resplendent Vishnu, the Lord of the Universe, arrived there mounted on his Eagle-vehicle Garuda, handling conch-shell, disc, and mace in his three of four hands, clad in yellow-ochre robes, wearing golden bracelets, and while best gods eulogised him, and his arrival there is like the arrival of sun mounted on black cloud to accord the gratuitous gift called the rain. [1-15-16, 17]"
Bala Kanda,15,18,"Vishnu having met Brahma stood there contemplating, and then all of the gods on bowing down and offering prayers addressed Vishnu."
Bala Kanda,15,18,"""Oh! Vishnu, desiring prosperity in all the worlds we nominate you to become the son of the ruler and lord of Ayodhya, namely Dasharatha, who is a virtuous one, renowned one and one whose resplendence equals that of the sages, and oh, Vishnu, through the wives of such a king Dasharatha, who are in similitude with the hrii, the virtue, shrii, the affluence, and kiirti, the glory, you have a fourfold transformation and take birth as their son. [1-15-19, 20, 21a]"
Bala Kanda,15,19,"""Oh! Vishnu, on your taking birth as human through the wives of Dasharatha you eliminate Ravana in war, who has become exacerbating and thorny to all worlds, and who is otherwise not eliminable for gods. [1-15-21b, 22a]"
Bala Kanda,15,20,"""He that preposterous demon Ravana with his invigorated doggedness is torturing gods along with eminent saints, gandharva-s, and siddha-s. [1-15-22b, 23a]"
Bala Kanda,15,21,"""He that furious one with his insolence is knocking down sages from their celestial abodes, and like that he is knocking down the gandharva-s and apsara celestials too from the heavenly gardens Nandana, where they will be taking delight. [1-15-23b, 24a]"
Bala Kanda,15,22,"""We the celestial beings like siddha-s, gandharva-s, yaksha-s along with sages have actually come for his elimination, and thereby we seek shelter in you. [1-15-24b, 25a]"
Bala Kanda,15,23,"""Oh, enemy tormentor, oh, Vishnu, you are the ultimate recourse for all us in eliminating enemies of divinity, hence you make up your mind to take birth in human world."" The gods appealed to Vishnu that way. [1-15-25b, 26a]"
Bala Kanda,15,24,"When the god of gods Vishnu, the supreme one among deities, one who is revered by all worlds is eulogised this way, then he spoke to all of those celestials that abide in the righteousness and that are in the assemblage, keeping the Forefather Brahma at their helm. [1-15-26a, 27]"
Bala Kanda,15,25,"""Get rid off the fear, let safety be upon you, on eliminating that cruel and evil-minded Ravana who became dreadful to deities and sages, along with his sons, grandsons, friends, cousins and relatives, ministers and forces too in war for your welfare, I will then reside in human world ruling this earth for eleven thousand years."" Thus Vishnu assured the gods. [1-15-28, 29, 30a]"
Bala Kanda,15,26,"On giving boon to all gods in that way the kind-hearted god Vishnu started to think about the instituting base for his birth in human world. [1-15-30b, 31a]"
Bala Kanda,15,27,"And then that lotus-petal-eyed one agreeing to manifest himself in fourfold way is predisposed towards Dasharatha to be his father. [1-15-31b, 32a]"
Bala Kanda,15,28,"Then all the groups of gods, sages, gandharva-s, with rudraa-s, and apsarasa-s, extolled Vishnu with prayers of divine exposition. [1-15-32b, c]"
Bala Kanda,15,33,"""Oh! Vishnu, he that fiery one who is renowned for evil acts and who is the hater of Indra, that Ravana is uprising furiously with his heightened arrogance, and he has become a thorn in the side of hermits hence he is a fright to sages, afor he torturesd insubordinates to the the extent of loud wailing; hence we pray you to eliminate that Ravana."""
Bala Kanda,15,34,"""On eliminating that furiously vainglorious Ravana with all his forces and with all his kinsmen neutralise the pandemonium created by him in all the worlds, and for a long time to come you get rid of your febrility, and you please return to your heavenly abode, namely your blameless and faultless Vaikuntha."
Bala Kanda,16,1,"Later when the Omnipresent Narayana is thus nominated by best gods, and though he knows the outcome, he gently spoke these words to gods in this way."
Bala Kanda,16,2,"""What is the idea to eliminate that demon's chief Ravana, oh, gods, adopting which strategy I will have to eliminate that thorn in the side of sages?"" Thus Vishnu asked the gods."
Bala Kanda,16,3,"Asked thus all the gods said to that sempiternal Vishnu, ""on assuming a human form, eliminate Ravana in a war."""
Bala Kanda,16,4,"""Oh, destroyer of enemies, he that Ravana undertook a vehement ascesis for a long period, thereby the creator of worlds and the first born one Brahma, felt gladsome of his ascesis."
Bala Kanda,16,5,"""Satisfied with his ascesis Brahma gave boon to that demon that he shall have no fear for his life from many kinds of beings, excepting humans, because that demon indeed slighted humans earlier at the time of bestowing boon. [1-16-5, 6a]"
Bala Kanda,16,6,"""Thus, on getting boon from the Forefather Brahma he has become arrogant and torturing the three worlds, and he is even abducting women. As such, oh, enemy destroyer Vishnu, his elimination is envisaged through humans alone."" So said gods to Vishnu. [1-16-6b, 7]"
Bala Kanda,16,8,"On hearing that speech of gods said that way, he that kind-hearted Vishnu then chose Dasharatha as his father in human world."
Bala Kanda,16,9,"During that time the great resplendent king and an enemy subduer Dasharatha is performing putrakaameSTi ritual, desiring progeny as he is sonless."
Bala Kanda,16,10,"On taking a decision Vishnu took leave of Forefather Brahma, and vanished while he is still being extolled by gods and sages."
Bala Kanda,16,11,"Then, from Fire of Altar Dasharatha's ritual there emerged a greatly vigorous and energetic Divine Being with an unparalleled resplendence, called yajna puruSa."
Bala Kanda,16,12,He is clad in black and red garments and his face is red and his voice resembled the drumbeat. His moustache and hairdo are soft like that of a lion's mane.
Bala Kanda,16,13,"And he is endowed with auspicious features and decorated with divine ornaments, in height he is like a mountain peak, and in valiance he is like an imperious tiger."
Bala Kanda,16,13,"That great ritual being personally brought a big golden vessel carrying it with both of his hands as if he would personally handle his own wife, which vessel is made from the molten gold and covered with a silver lid, and which appeared to be crafted out of a divine illusion, since it is dazzling like sun and glowing like the tongues of flame, and that vessel is full with the divine dessert. [1-16-14, 15]"
Bala Kanda,16,16,"That divine person on observing king Dasharatha said these words ""oh, king, you may know me as the being sent by Prajapati."""
Bala Kanda,16,17,"There after, king Dasharatha greeted that divine being with palms adjoining and said in reply, ""oh, god, welcome to you, and what shall I do for you?"""
Bala Kanda,16,18,"Then again, that divine being sent by Prajapati said these words, ""oh, king, now you have obtained this dessert in golden vessel as you have propitiated gods."
Bala Kanda,16,19,"""Oh, tigerly king, take this dessert prepared by divinities, this is a blessed dessert that enriches progeny and health."
Bala Kanda,16,20,"""Oh, king, let this be consumed"" saying so he further said, ""for which purpose you have performed this ritual that childbearing will be fructified in your wives by bearing sons, hence give this among your eligible wives."" So said the divine being to Dasharatha."
Bala Kanda,16,21,Agreeing to that the king wholeheartedly took that god-given golden vessel full with divine food.
Bala Kanda,16,22,"With high ecstasy Dasharatha revered that Ritual Being, the Prajapati Purusha or yaGYa purusha , an astonishing and delightful being in his appearance, and performed circumambulations around him."
Bala Kanda,16,23,On obtaining that dessert prepared by gods then Dasharatha is highly gladdened like a pauper obtaining unforeseen wealth.
Bala Kanda,16,24,"On completing his work of giving the golden vessel with dessert then that divine being who is astonishing by his form and highly glowing by his physique, disappeared then and there itself."
Bala Kanda,16,25,Lit up with beams of happiness Dasharatha's palace chambers shone forth like the autumnal sky brightened with moonbeams.
Bala Kanda,16,26,"Then Dasharatha on entering palace chambers spoke this to queen Kausalya, ""Receive this dessert to beget your son."""
Bala Kanda,16,25,"The king then gave half of the dessert to queen Kausalya, and he gave half of the half, i.e., one fourth to queen Sumitra. And to Kaikeyi he gave half of the remaining half, i.e., one eight of the dessert, with a desire to beget sons. Then thinking for a while gave the remaining, i.e., one-eighth portion again to queen Sumitra. Thus, the king distributed the dessert to his wives differently. [1-16-27, 28, 29]"
Bala Kanda,16,30,"On getting the dessert all of those best ladies of the king, whose hearts are exuberant with happiness, deemed it as a reward."
Bala Kanda,16,31,Then on consuming dessert those best ladies of the king whose resplendence then vied with that Fire and Sun became pregnant after some time.
Bala Kanda,16,32,"Then on seeing his queens with confirmed pregnancies Dasharatha regained his lost heart for sons, and he is gladdened like Vishnu, who will always be gladsome when worshipped by gods, namely Indra and others, as well as by the assemblages of great souls, sages."
Bala Kanda,17,1,"When Vishnu attained the sonship of the great-souled king Dasharatha, then Brahma the self-created addressed all of the gods this way."
Bala Kanda,17,2,"""Let mighty and guise changing helpmates be procreated to that truth abiding and valorous Vishnu who is the well-wisher of all of us."
Bala Kanda,17,3,"""Let monkey-shaped progeny equalling Vishnu's valour be procreated from the physiques of prominent apsara-s and gandharva-s, from the girls of yaksha-s and pannaga-s, and also thus from the bodies of kinnaraa-s, she-vidyaadharaa-s, she-riksha-s and she-monkeys, and they shall be wizards of miracles and audacious ones, in travel they shall have air's speed, bestowed with intellect they shall be the knowers of ideation, and with their divine physique they shall be ineliminable, they shall be endowed with all the assaultive aspects of all missiles, and they shall be untiring in their efforts, like you who thrive on amrita, the ambrosia, unmindful of thirst and hunger. [1-17-3, 4, 5, 6]"
Bala Kanda,17,7,"""I have already created the eminent bear Jambavanta in earlier times, as he suddenly came forth from my yawning face."
Bala Kanda,17,8,"When Brahma addressed them thus, those gods have agreed to his order and accordingly started to parent sons in the semblance of monkeys."
Bala Kanda,17,9,"The great-souled celestial groups, namely the sages, siddha-s, vidyaadharaa-s, caarana-s have created valiant sons that are forest rangers."
Bala Kanda,17,10,"Indra procreated the lord of vanara-s, namely Vali, who by his physique is like Mt. Mahendra, and the highest humidifier among all the humidifiers, namely the Sun, procreated Sugreeva."
Bala Kanda,17,11,"Brihaspati, the Jupiter, gave rise to a great monkey named Tara, who is the most important one among all vanara-s, and who excels all by his intelligence."
Bala Kanda,17,12,"The brilliant Gandhamaadana is the son of Kubera, while the divine architect Vishvakarma procreated the great monkey called Nala."
Bala Kanda,17,13,"The bright son of Fire is Neela whose blaze is like that of fire and who excels other monkeys by his in resplendence, renown and courage."
Bala Kanda,17,14,"The Ashwin twin gods whose wealth is their beautiful appearance have personally procreated two vanara-s namely Mainda and Dvivida, blessing them with beautiful appearance."
Bala Kanda,17,15,"The Rain-god procreated the vanara named Susheshana, and Thunder-god gave rise to the great mighty Sharabha."
Bala Kanda,17,13,"The direct son of Air-god is the marvellous and adventurous Hanuma with an indestructible body, and one identical in the speed of lady Vinata's son, namely Garuda, the divine eagle vehicle of Vishnu, and among all monkey chiefs he is the intelligent and the indefatigable one too. [1-17-16, 17a]"
Bala Kanda,17,14,"Thus the gods have procreated many thousands of such valorous and guise changing monkeys who with their immeasurable strength and bravery are manifest for the elimination of the decahedral demon Ravana. [1-17-17b, 18a]"
Bala Kanda,17,15,"And they with their elephantine, mountainous and prodigious bodies quickly took birth in bears, monkeys, sacred langoors. [1-17-18b, 19a]"
Bala Kanda,17,16,"Those that are procreated have attained the shape, getup and valour of the god that has fathered them, and thus the monkey race is procreated separately and individually. [1-17-19b, 20a]"
Bala Kanda,17,17,"Some of the vanara-s endowed with superior valour are born to female langoors, and like that some more to female bears and kinnaraa-s. [1-17-20b, 21a]"
Bala Kanda,17,18,"Several of the gods, great-sages, gandharva-s, eagles, yaksha-s, and the celebrated reptiles, kimpusha-s, siddha-s, vidyaadharaa-s, uraga-s and caarana-s and even the prominent maidens of apsara-s, she-vidyaadharaa-s, naaga, gandharva-s then gladly procreated all of the thousands of forest-ranging and valiant vanara sons from their bodies that are forest rangers. [21b, 22, 23, 24a, b]"
Bala Kanda,17,19,"They are endowed with guise changing faculties, with bodily might and by their pride and might are identical to lions and tigers, and they are born-free in their movement in forests. [1-17-24b, 25a]"
Bala Kanda,17,20,"All of them are the assaulters with stones, and all are the attackers with trees, and all have their nails and claws as their weapons, yet all are experts in missiles. [1-17-25b, 26a]"
Bala Kanda,17,21,"They can rock greatest mountains, rip firm rooted trees, and with their speed they can agitate the of lord of rivers, namely the ocean. [1-17-26b, 27a]"
Bala Kanda,17,22,"They can shatter the ground with their two feet, leap and cross over great oceans, and they can seize the clouds entering arch of heaven. [1-17-27b, 28a]"
Bala Kanda,17,23,"They can catch ruttish elephants that tumultuously move in forests, and just with the sound of their blare they make sky flying birds to fall. [1-17-28b, 29a]"
Bala Kanda,17,24,"Thus the gods and others have procreated millions of such noble souled Vaanaras as the chiefs of warriors who can change their guise at their wish. [1-17-29b, 30a]"
Bala Kanda,17,25,"Those vanara generals who took birth thus became the prominent generals among the principle battalions of monkeys, and they have also procreated brave monkeys on their own. [1-17-30a, 31b]"
Bala Kanda,17,26,"Some thousands of them stayed on the ridges of Mt. Riskshavat while others reached many kinds of other mountains and forests. [1-17-31b, 32a]"
Bala Kanda,17,27,"All of the monkeys stood by the brothers, namely the son of Indra Vali, and the son of sun Sugreeva, and even with the monkey generals like Nala, Neela and Hanuma et al. [1-17-32b, 33]"
Bala Kanda,17,34,"All of those who are well-versed in warfare and endowed with the might of divine eagle Garuda, used to thwart the pride of lions, tigers and great snakes just by their own prideful subjugation while they move about the forests."
Bala Kanda,17,35,"He who is adroit, extremely mighty, and highly indomitable, that Vali protected bears, langoors, and monkeys just by the strength of his arms."
Bala Kanda,17,36,"The earth with its mountains, forests and oceanward places is overspread with those brave ones that possess diverse physiques and peculiar indication marks of their stock."
Bala Kanda,17,37,"The earth is thus suffused with those mighty army generals of Vanara race whose physiques resembled the clusters of clouds and peaks of mountains, and who have emerged for the reason of helping Rama."
Bala Kanda,18,1,"On the competition of the horse ritual of high-souled Dasharatha, the golds having received their portion of sacrificial oblation returned to their abodes as they have come."
Bala Kanda,18,2,"The king completing his consecratory vows held for horse ritual, entered Ayodhya city along with the company of his queens, servants, guards and vehicles."
Bala Kanda,18,3,"The other kings who arrived for the ritual are delighted when befittingly honoured by the king Dasharatha, and they too returned to their countries, after suitably adoring the eminent sage Vashishta."
Bala Kanda,18,4,The entourages of those kings who set forth homeward from that city are highly gladdened and shone forth in fine fettle.
Bala Kanda,18,5,"On the departure of visiting kings, then that fortunate king Dasharatha entered the city Ayodhya, keeping eminent Brahman priests ahead of him in the procession."
Bala Kanda,18,6,"Well adored by king Dasharatha sage Rishyasringa also travelled along with his wife Shanta, followed by his father-in-law King Romapada, and along with other co-travellers, namely the entourage of Romapada."
Bala Kanda,18,7,"On dispersing all of them king Dasharatha gratifyingly dwelled there in Ayodhya, with a satiated heart dwelling upon the birth of his sons."
Bala Kanda,18,8,"On completion of the ritual, six seasons have passed by; then in the twelfth month, i.e., in chaitra mAsa, and on the ninth day of that chaitra month [April-May], when it is punarvasu nakshatra yukta navamI tithi, i.e., when the ruling star of that ninth day is punarvasu, for which Aditi is the presiding deity; and when five of the nine planets - sUrya, kuja, guru, shukra, shani are in ucCha sthAna-s, namely, when those planets are in ascension in their respective houses - meSha, makara, karkaTa, mIna, tula - rAshI-s; and when chandra yukta guru, karkaTa lagne - Jupiter in conjuction with Moon is ascendant in Cancer, and when day is advancing, Queen Kausalya gave birth to a son with all the divine attributes like lotus-red eyes, lengthy arms, roseate lips, voice like drumbeat, and who took birth to delight the Ikshwaku dynasty and adored by all the worlds, and who is the greatly blessed epitome of Vishnu, namely Rama. [1-18-8, 9, 10, 11]"
Bala Kanda,18,9,"Twice six months had rolled a way since the great sacrifice was over and, in the first month of the New Year, on the ninth day of the bright fortnight, the Lord of the worlds chose to take human form and sent down half of His essence as the son of Kausalya (thenceforth to be known as Rama), the world-honored One, the crowning glory ot the grand line of Ikshwku, and the sum of all perfections. The constellation Punarvasu, of which Aditi was the regent, was chosen to preside at his birth. The Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn were in ascension in their respective houses. Aries, Capricornus, Cancer, Pisces and the Libra, Jupiter and the Moon were in conjunction ; the rising sign was Cancer. And KausalyA, shone with unparalleled effulgence, even as Aditi when she gave birth to Indra, the lord of the Shining Ones, the Vajra-wielder. - C. R. Sreeniuasa Aiyangar, 1910."
Bala Kanda,18,12,"Kausalya shone forth with such a son whose resplendence is unlimited, as with lady Aditi who once stood out with her son Indra, the best one among gods."
Bala Kanda,18,13,"Queen Kaikeyi gave birth to Bharata, one embodied with all merits, and whose truthfulness itself is his valour and who is fourth component of manifest Vishnu, namely Rama."
Bala Kanda,18,14,"Queen Sumitra then gave birth to two sons who are the embodied epitomes of Vishnu, namely Lakshmana, and Shatrughna, who are valiant ones and experts in all kinds of weaponry."
Bala Kanda,18,15,"With the dawn of sun on the next day, fair-minded Bharata is born under Pisces where puSyami is the star of day, later the sons of Sumitra, namely Lakshmana and Shatrughna are born under Cancer, where aaSreSa is the star of the day, i.e., the tenth of chaitra month,"
Bala Kanda,18,16,"Thus there are four great-souled sons of Dasharatha, born on separate instances, who are virtuous, charming, and by brilliance they are in similitude with two stars of each of the asterisms called puurva bhadra and uttara bhaadra."
Bala Kanda,18,15,"The celestial singers sang melodiously, paradisiacal dancing parties danced, divine drums drummed and heavens rained flowers, with all this there is a great festivity in Ayodhya with thronging people. [1-18-17, 18a]"
Bala Kanda,18,16,"Hilarity filled the streets with people stampeding them and with the flurry of actors, dancers, singers and instrumentalists, as well by other onlookers, and there on the streets widely strewn are all kinds of gems appreciating the artists. [1-18-18b, 19]"
Bala Kanda,18,20,"The king gave worthy gifts to eulogisers, bard singers, and panegyrists, and to Brahmans he gave funds and wealth in the form of thousands of cows."
Bala Kanda,18,18,"Elapsed are eleven days and the naming ceremony is performed, then Vashishta, the chief priest, named the high-souled elder one as Rama, Kaikeyi's son as Bharata, and one son of Sumitra as Lakshmana and the other as Shatrughna [1-18-21, 22]"
Bala Kanda,18,19,"The king feasted Brahmans, urbanites and villagers and he gifted many valuable gems to Brahmans in an unlimited way, and all the rituals of birth and ceremonies sequel to it like naming ceremony, first-food-feeding ceremony, first-hair-removal ceremony, and sacred thread ceremony are performed in respect of the princes. [1-18-23, 24a]"
Bala Kanda,18,20,"Among those princes the eldest one Rama is like a flagstaff and a delight of his father Dasharatha, and he became acceptable to all beings like the self-created Brahma. [1-18-24b, 25a]"
Bala Kanda,18,21,"All the princes are scholars in Veda-s, valiant ones, all are interested in the welfare of the world, all are intellectuals and all of them possess an air of probity. [1-18-25b, 26a]"
Bala Kanda,18,22,"Among them the great resplendent Rama, whose valour itself is his truthfulness, is the dear one to all the world like the tranquil moon. [1-18-26b, 27a]"
Bala Kanda,18,23,"Rama is admittedly a champion of riding elephants and horses, also in tactical charioting, and he rejoices in the art of archery, and absorbed in the obedient service of his father. [1-18-27b, 28a]"
Bala Kanda,18,24,"Right from childhood Lakshmana, the enhancer of prosperity, is always amiable towards his world-charming elder brother Rama. [1-18-28b, 29a]"
Bala Kanda,18,25,"Lakshmana who is endowed with the wealth of dedication dedicated himself to Rama with bodily service, and while performing all agreeable deeds in respect of Rama, he behaved like Rama's alter ego. [1-18-29b, 30a]"
Bala Kanda,18,26,"That best one among the men Rama does not get his sleep without Lakshmana and he would not eat food brought for him, however delicious it may be, without Lakshmana. [1-18-30b, 31a]"
Bala Kanda,18,27,"Whenever Raghava mounts a horse and goes on a hunting game Lakshmana rushes after him wielding his bow as a squire. [1-18-31b, 32a]"
Bala Kanda,18,28,"Lakshmana's younger brother Shatrughna is a dear one to Bharata, like that Bharata too held Shatrughna dearer than his own lives. [1-18-32b, 33a]"
Bala Kanda,18,33,King Dasharatha is highly gladdened with four of his highly fortunate sons like the Forefather Brahma with gods in heaven.
Bala Kanda,18,30,"When all of the four sons are thus prospering with prudence, gifted with all the merits, self-conscious to do wrong deeds, well-known for their gentility, knowers of pros and cons and even the conscientious princes, then their father Dasharatha is contented in respect of all of them who are such radiantly brilliant and potential princes, like Brahma. [1-18-34b, 35, 36a]"
Bala Kanda,18,31,"Even those tigerly-men, namely the princes, are engrossed in the studies of Veda-s, delighted to render service to their father and they are also the experts in art of archery. [1-18-36b, 37a]"
Bala Kanda,18,32,"Then the noble souled Dasharatha contemplated along with his priestly teachers and relatives about the matrimonial alliances of his sons. [1-18-37b, 38a]"
Bala Kanda,18,33,"While the great souled Dasharatha is discussing the marriages of princes among his ministers, the highly powerful sage Vishvamitra arrived. [1-18-38b, 39a]"
Bala Kanda,18,34,"Desirous to have an audience with king Vishvamitra said to the doorkeeper, ""Let the king be informed quickly that I, the son of Gadhi from the dynasty of Kushi, have come"" [1-18-39b, 40a]"
Bala Kanda,18,35,"On listening those words all the doorkeepers are dumbfounded, and ushered by those words they quickly rushed to the place of Dasharatha. [1-18-40b, 41a]"
Bala Kanda,18,36,"Then on their arriving at the king's palace the doorkeepers have announced to the king of Ikshvaku-s, namely Dasharatha, about the arrival of sage Vishvamitra. [1-18-41b, 42a]"
Bala Kanda,18,37,"On hearing that message from doorkeepers Dasharatha is highly pleased and he has gone towards Vishvamitra in a self-possessed manner along with royal priests, as Indra would ceremoniously go towards Brahma. [1-18-42b, 43a]"
Bala Kanda,18,38,"Then on seeing the resplendent sage Vishvamitra, whose radiance is by his own ascesis and who has severe self-discipline, the king offered water with a gladsome aspect, as first customary hospitality in receiving unexpected guest. [1-18-43b, 44a]"
Bala Kanda,18,39,"On receiving water from the king scripturally and customarily Vishvamitra enquired after the well-being and welfare of king Dasharatha. [1-18-44b, 45a]"
Bala Kanda,18,40,"That highly righteous sage Vishvamitra asked the king after the well-being of city, exchequer, rural areas, friends and relatives. [1-18-45b, 46a]"
Bala Kanda,18,41,"Sage Vishvamitra asked Dasharatha, ""Are all of the provincial kings acquiescent to you, and all your enemies conquered? Are you properly performing the devotional and social works?"" [1-18-46b, 47a]"
Bala Kanda,18,42,"And on meeting the eminent sage Vashishta and with them the other exalted sages according to custom Vishvamitra asked after their well-being. [1-18-47b, 48a]"
Bala Kanda,18,43,"Then adoringly invited by the king Dasharatha all of them gladly entered the palace and they took their seats according to protocol. [1-18-48b, 49a]"
Bala Kanda,18,44,"Then the very generous king Dasharatha is gladdened at heart at the arrival of Vishvamitra, and he spoke this way feeling happy to adore that sage. [1-18-49b, 50a]"
Bala Kanda,18,45,"""I deem your arrival is in the vein of mortals attaining ambrosia, rainfall in a droughty land, a barren father begetting a son through his deserving wife, a regain of long lost treasures, and the gladness at a great happening, oh, great saint, welcome to you."" [1-18-50b, 51, 52a]"
Bala Kanda,18,46,"""Oh, Brahman, as I am the one who is delighted for your arrival, and as you are the most eligible recipient from me, what is that choicest object of yours to be fulfilled by me, and in which way. Oh, endower of respect, for me your arrival is fortunate whereby my birth is fructified and my life flourished today, and wherefore I could see a great Brahman like you visiting my home, therefore the sun appears to have dawned in my night. [1-18-52b, 53, 54a]"
Bala Kanda,18,47,"""Originally your glory was explicit by your title kingly-sage, and subsequently you attained the Absolute-sainthood by your ascesis, and you are venerable to me, in many ways."" [1-18-54b, 55a]"
Bala Kanda,18,48,"""Oh, Brahman, thereby your arrival at my place is surprising and ideally sacred to me, and by your very appearance I have become one who has gone on a quiet pilgrimage. [1-18-55b, 56a]"
Bala Kanda,18,49,"""You may tell me, entreating which work your arrival chanced here and I feel that I am indeed blessed and wish to make it happen to achieve results. [1-18-56b, 57a]"
Bala Kanda,18,50,"""It is unapt of you to deliberate about the feasibility of the work, oh, sage with blest vows, while I am the fulfiller of it without any reminder, since you are god to me, indeed. [1-18-57b, 58a]"
Bala Kanda,18,51,"""Oh, Brahman, this is the great prosperity that bechanced on me, and this is propriety in its entirety that bechanced on me, as a result of your arrival. [1-18-58b, c]"
Bala Kanda,18,59,"On hearing the words of high-minded Dasharatha, said that way in all his humbleness, and those that are pleasant to ears as well to heart, he who is a renowned for his personal attributes and a reputed one by his exceptional qualities, that sublime sage Vishvamitra obtained high rejoice."
Bala Kanda,19,1,"On listening the grand and detailed sentences of that King the lion Dasharatha, the great resplendent Sage Vishvamitra is thrilled with happiness and spoke this way."
Bala Kanda,19,2,"""Oh, tigerly king, to you befitting are these words and to none else, as you are born in a great dynasty and tutored by Vashishta."
Bala Kanda,19,3,"""What concerns I have in my heart I am going to say, and you take decision thereof, oh, tigerly-king, and become truthful to your promises."
Bala Kanda,19,4,"""These days I am abiding by a sacrificial vow to attain a spiritual goal but, oh, best one among men, two guise changing demons as causing obstacles to that ritual."
Bala Kanda,19,5,"""At the near end of almost completed ritual of mine two valiant and well-trained demons, namely Mareecha and Subaahu, are drenching the Altar of Fire with streams of meat and blood, from the sky. [1-19-5, 6a]"
Bala Kanda,19,6,"""When the ritual vow is thus ravaged I, as the one who exerted myself for the ritual, had to depart from that place, unenthusiastically. [1-19-6n, 7a]"
Bala Kanda,19,7,"""And to me there is no will to let loose my anger, oh, king, as no curse shall be issued under vows, and like that the activity during rituals shall be inoffensive, isn't it. [1-19-7b, 8a]"
Bala Kanda,19,8,"""As such, oh, tigerly king, it will be apt of you spare the services of that brave one whose valour itself is his truthfulness, that youngling whose hair locks are all the more jet black like crow wings on either side of his head, spare that eldest son of yours, namely Rama. [1-19-8b, 9a]"
Bala Kanda,19,9,"""Indeed, he is capable to eradicate those demons that are thwarting the ritual by his own divine resplendence, and protected by me as well. [1-19-9b, 10a]"
Bala Kanda,19,10,"""I will also accord many kinds of benefits to him by which he acquires renown in all the three worlds, no doubt about it. [1-19-10b, 11a]"
Bala Kanda,19,11,"""Those two demons will be rendered incapable to stand fast on affronting Rama in anywise, and none other than Raghava has the fortitude to eliminate those two. [1-19-11b, 12a]"
Bala Kanda,19,12,"""Those two sinners that are berserk by their vigour have gone into the subjection of death's noose, oh tigerly king, cannot counterbalance the great-souled Rama. [1-19-12b, 13a]"
Bala Kanda,19,13,"""It will be unapt of you to show your paternal fondness, oh, king, upon my oath, be assured that those two demons are eradicated. [1-19-13b, 14a]"
Bala Kanda,19,14,"""I am sensible of that sublime-soul Rama, whose valour is his truthfulness, and even this great resplendent Vashishta and these saints that are here are aware. [1-19-14b, 15a]"
Bala Kanda,19,15,"""If you wish to gain in value of probity, a long-lasting and paramount renown on earth it will be apt of you to handover Rama to me. [1-19-15b, 16a]"
Bala Kanda,19,16,"""Oh, Dasharatha, you may send Rama if only your ministers and all the other elite headed by Vashishta are going to give assent. [1-19-16b, 17a]"
Bala Kanda,19,17,"""It will be apt of you to send your choicest son, the lotus-eyed Rama, just for ten days of the ritual without temporising. [1-19-17b, 18a]"
Bala Kanda,19,18,"""I wish you to take decision as to how th my ritual's time is not lapsed, and let safety betide you, let not your heart be rendered to grieve."" Thus Vishvamitra said to Dasharatha. [1-19-18b, 19a]"
Bala Kanda,19,19,"On saying those words that comprise fairness and meaningfulness that virtue-souled great saint with great resplendence paused. [1-19-19b, 20a]"
Bala Kanda,19,20,"On hearing the propitious words of sage Vishvamitra that best king Dasharatha shuddered and swooned as he is muffled up with profound adversity, and after that on regaining consciousness he sunk down in fear. [1-19-20b, 21]"
Bala Kanda,19,22,"This way on hearing that word of the saint Vishvamitra which is explicitly slitting his mind and heart that illustrious and noble-souled king Dasharatha then became highly annoyed at heart, and flustered extremely in his throne."
Bala Kanda,20,1,"On hearing what is spoken by Vishvamitra the tigerly-king Dasharatha became insensate for a time, and on redeeming senses he said this."
Bala Kanda,20,2,"""""Less than sixteen years of age is my lotus-eyed Rama, and I see no warring aptitude to him with the demons."
Bala Kanda,20,3,"""Here is the full-fledged battalion, called akshouhiNi sena , for which I am the leader and controller, and fortified by this army I will go there to encounter those demons."
Bala Kanda,20,4,"""Brave and daring are these soldiers of mine, and as experts in weaponry they are the appropriate ones to combat the hordes of demons, but, it will be ungentle of you to take Rama with you."
Bala Kanda,20,5,"""I alone with bow in my hand can protect your ritual, and as long as I bear my lives so long I war with those nightwalkers staying in the van of war."
Bala Kanda,20,6,""" I myself wish to come over there thereby the works of ritual will be well-guarded and unimpeded, but, taking Rama with you will be ungracious of you."
Bala Kanda,20,7,"""Why because, Rama is boy! And he is unschooled in his princely education; does he know the strengths and weaknesses of opponents - no; has he got the equipage of arsenal - no; has he any expertise in warfare - no; is he an equal to the demons - no; be that as it may, those demons definitely conduct a deceitful warfare, isn't it. [1-19-7, 8a]"
Bala Kanda,20,8,"""Alienated from Rama I am disinclined to live even for a moment, oh, tigerly sage, hence taking Rama with you will be unjust. [1-20-8b, 9a]"
Bala Kanda,20,9,"""Otherwise, oh, Brahman with best vows, if you so wish to take Rama along with you, you lead him off along with me, and along with my four kinds of troops. [1-20-9b, 10a]"
Bala Kanda,20,10,"""Sixty thousand years have passed from my birth, oh! Vishvamitra, and this Rama is engendered at this age, that too with tribulations, hence taking Rama with you will be inappropriate of you. [1-20-10b, 11a]"
Bala Kanda,20,11,"""I will have exceptional affection for all of my four sons, isn't it, and among them Rama has a significance in the matter of his descent as an eldest son, hence taking Rama with you will be unjust of you. [1-20-11b, 12a]"
Bala Kanda,20,12,"""Oh, eminent sage, of what fortitude are those demons? Whose sons are they? Who are they? How is their size and shape? Also who protects all of them? [1-20-12b, 13a]"
Bala Kanda,20,13,"""Oh, Brahman, how Rama, or my forces, or I myself have to retaliate those demons that are deceitful militants. [1-20-13b, 14a]"
Bala Kanda,20,14,"""Tell me all that, oh, god, how I have to carry on when warring with those evil minded demons, for the demons will be delirious by their audacity, isn't it..."" Thus Dasharatha asked Vishvamitra insistently. On hearing those words Sage Vishvamitra replied this way. [1-20-14b, 15]"
Bala Kanda,20,15,"""One born in Paulastya dynasty, an extremely mighty and exceedingly brave demon named Ravana is there, and he with the boon given by Brahma, and accompanied with many other demons is torturing the triad of worlds, contemptuously. [1-20-16, 17a]"
Bala Kanda,20,16,"""Unequivocally that chief of demons is the brother of Kubera and the son of sage Vishravasa, thus we hear. [1-20-17b, 18a]"
Bala Kanda,20,17,"""That formidable Ravana is not a devastator of rituals by himself, even so, two very mighty demons called Mareecha and Subaahu will cause devastating hindrances to rituals, instigated by him."" Thus Sage Vishvamitra said to Dasharatha. [1-20-18b, 19]"
Bala Kanda,20,20,"Thus when he is said so by that sage Vishvamitra, then the king Dasharatha spoke to the sage, ""I myself am not capable of standing against that evil minded Ravana, in truth, where is the question of deputing my young Rama to confront him?"
Bala Kanda,20,21,"""You are the knower of probity, such as you are, you may please bestow benevolence upon my boyish son, as well on a less fortunate one like me too, and as our mentor you are indeed a god of ours."
Bala Kanda,20,22,"""Gods, demons, celestial beings like gandharva-s, yaksha-s, winged and reptile beings are incapable to bear the brunt of that Ravana in fight, why tell again about humans."
Bala Kanda,20,21,"""But that Ravana depletes the valour of valorous opponents in a battle, oh, eminent sage, either with my entire forces, or with all my sons I am inadequate to grapple with all his forces, or with him, individually. [1-20-23, 24a]"
Bala Kanda,20,22,"""My boyish son is godlike and unfledged in warfare, oh, Brahman, and he is the one who alleviates me from punnama naraka the hell of sonless fathers... no, I cannot spare my son in anyway. [1-20-24b, 25a]"
Bala Kanda,20,23,"""Further, those saboteurs of your ritual namely Mareecha and Subaahu, are similar to Death-god and the descendents of the earliest demons and subverters of rituals, namely Sunda and Upasunda, no, I cannot spare my son, in any case. [1-20-25b, 26a]"
Bala Kanda,20,24,"""Mareecha and Subaahu are well-trained and valorous ones, hence I will proceed with all my friendly forces to war with either of those two demons, otherwise, I along with all my relatives implore upon you for your exoneration in my failure to comply my own promises. [1-20-26b, 27]"
Bala Kanda,20,28,"Thus, by the incongruous talk of Dasharatha, the outstanding Brahman and son of Sage Kushi, namely sage Vishvamitra is overwhelmed with outrageous anger by his mentation, and that fire-like glorious sage looked like the ritual fire into which many inflammable oblations are offered, and which is drenched with a lot of clarified butter, whereby it is flaring up its tongues."
Bala Kanda,21,1,"On hearing the wavery words of Dasharatha that are full of fond for his son, Vishvamitra wrathfully replied this sentence to the king."
Bala Kanda,21,2,"""On promising me to fulfil my object in the first instance you wish to repudiate it now, undeserving is this kind of deviation for the kings of Raghava dynasty."
Bala Kanda,21,3,"""If this is worth while to you, oh, king, I wish to go away as I have come, and you with your feigned promises be nonchalantly happy with your kinsmen."" So said Vishvamitra to the king."
Bala Kanda,21,4,"When that prudent sage Vishvamitra is thus enwrapped in fury, then the whole earth trembled and the gods are scared."
Bala Kanda,21,5,"On knowing the appalled appearance of the entire world at the fury of Vishvamitra, Vashishta the great sage with high vows and an insightful one too, said these words to the king."
Bala Kanda,21,6,"""Born in Ikshwaku dynasty you are apparently the other god of ethics on earth, a staunch one with righteous vows and a glorious one too, such as you are, it will be unapt of you to forsake ethics."""
Bala Kanda,21,7,"""In three worlds you are renowned as the right-minded one, oh, Raghava, hence adhere to your own uprightness, and adhering to unrighteousness will be unapt of you."
Bala Kanda,21,8,"""Promising to effectuate something in any way and not effectuating the given word results in the perdition to the merits of iSTapurta Vedic rituals, hence oh, Raghava, leave hold of Rama."
Bala Kanda,21,9,"""Whether Rama is trained in weaponry or not, demons cannot trounce Rama as long as Kushi's son Vishvamitra protects him, like the heavenly firewall that protects divine nectar."
Bala Kanda,21,10,"""He is an embodiment of virtue, matchless among the venturesome, peerless in intellect among all in the world, and flawless in ascesis."
Bala Kanda,21,11,"""He is in the know-how of various missiles, and no other person is there in the triad of worlds, inclusive of sessile and mobile worlds, who is knowledgeable about him, or someone who can know him will be there in future, excepting myself."
Bala Kanda,21,12,"""While Gods cannot know Vishvamitra, can anybody from sages - no; immortals- no; demons - no; the gandharva-s and eminent yaksha-s together with the kinnaraa-s and great reptile beings - no, they cannot know him."
Bala Kanda,21,13,"""All the missiles known to Vishvamitra are the highly righteous children of Krishaasva Prajapati, where Prajapati-s were the earliest ruler of mankind, and god Shiva gave them to Vishvamitra when was ruling kingdom."
Bala Kanda,21,14,"""Those missiles are the sons of Daksha Prajaapati's daughters and her husband Krishaasva Prajapati, and they are disparate in their form, intrepid, dazzling, and victory-oriented missiles."
Bala Kanda,21,15,"""Jaya and Suprabha, the daughters of Daksha Prajapati, endowed with best waists gave birth to a hundred missiles and weaponry whose flare is supreme."
Bala Kanda,21,16,"""On getting a boon Jaya named wife of Krishaasva Prajapati is benefited with fifty best and formless sons with immeasurable fortitude for the destruction of ungodly beings."
Bala Kanda,21,17,"""Suprabha, another wife of Krishaasva Prajapati, gave birth to another fifty unassailable, unconquerable and mighty sons named the Eliminators."
Bala Kanda,21,18,"""And this sage Vishvamitra is in the precise know of the said missiles, and this principled one is also capable of creating hitherto unavailable missiles."
Bala Kanda,21,19,"""Thereby, oh, Raghava, nothing whatsoever is unknown to this great-souled Vishvamitra, who is a distinguished sage and the knower of virtue, either that has happened or that is happening."
Bala Kanda,21,20,"""Thus, the highly renowned and great resplendent sage Vishvamitra has this sort of enterprise, oh, king, allowing a doubt enter your mind in Rama's accompanying the sage will be unapt of you."
Bala Kanda,21,21,"""This son of Kushi, Vishvamitra, can as well control those demons by himself, but intending to accord beneficence to your son he approached you and imploring upon you."
Bala Kanda,21,21,"Thus the prominent king from Raghu dynasty, namely Dasharatha, became serene-minded by sage Vashishta's words, and he who is supreme among other kings and who has pronounced renown, that Dasharatha then gladly and wholeheartedly consented to the travel of Rama along with the sage Vishvamitra."
Bala Kanda,22,1,When Vashishta said that way king Dasharatha with an air of satisfaction personally fetched Rama along with Lakshmana.
Bala Kanda,22,2,"Rama is blessed for a propitious travel firstly by his mother Kausalya and then by his father king Dasharatha, thereupon the royal priest Vashishta rendered Vedic hymns blessing the journey, then Dasharatha well pleased in his heart of hearts kissed his son Rama on forehead and entrusted him to Vishvamitra. [1-22-2, 3]"
Bala Kanda,22,4,Then on seeing the lotus-eyed Rama following Vishvamitra the breeze became dustless and breezed pleasant for touch.
Bala Kanda,22,5,"When the great-souled Rama forged ahead there occurred an abounding downpour of flowers with the booming of divine drums, together with the boom and blare of drums and conch-shells of Ayodhya."
Bala Kanda,22,6,"Rama with jet-black hair-locks handling his bow followed Vishvamitra who walked ahead, while Lakshmana handling his own bow followed Rama."
Bala Kanda,22,6,"Rama and Lakshmana, with two quivers each and two bows in their hands, and making all the ten directions of compass lambent followed Vishvamitra, as if three headed serpents followed Vishvamitra, and with their highly dynamic physiques and spiritedness they look as if like the Ashwin twin gods of unequal charm following Brahma, the Forefather. [1-22-7, 8]"
Bala Kanda,22,7,"Those two youngsters with charming and bejewelled physiques are handling bows and swords and their fingers have leathern covers. Both the unreprovable brothers Rama and Lakshmana are highly resplendent and effulgent by their worth. While they are following Vishvamitra they looked like the sons of Fire-god, namely Skanda and Vishakha, following the great god with inscrutable potential, namely Shiva, and thus the brothers have made Vishvamitra to shine forth in even pose with god Shiva. [1-22-8, 9, 10a]"
Bala Kanda,22,8,"And on going one and half yojana distance Vishvamitra addressed Rama in a harmonious voice calling, 'oh, Rama', on the southern riverbank of Sarayu. [1-22-10b, 11a]"
Bala Kanda,22,9,""" ""Take water, my boy, and like that you receive a group of hymns, bala and ati bala from me, and let no time lapse. [1-22-11b, 12a]"
Bala Kanda,22,10,"""On receiving these hymns neither tiredness nor fever, nor disfiguring of personality can effect you, nor the demons can charge you either you are sleeping or unvigilant. [1-11-12b, 13a]"
Bala Kanda,22,11,"""As it is none whosoever on earth can equal you in dexterity, Rama, and by reciting these hymns none can equal you in the three worlds. [1-22-13b, 14a]"
Bala Kanda,22,12,"""My dear Raghava, if bala atibala hymns are practised, oh, impeccable one, none can equal you in the world by your handsomeness, calibre, erudition, by your discernment, and even in replying or rebutting you. [1-22-14b, 15]"
Bala Kanda,22,16,"""On receiving these two teachings there will be none similar to you, for bala and atibala are the mothers of all knowledge."
Bala Kanda,22,17,"""Oh, best one among men, Raghava, if you go on reciting bala and atiblala hymns, my dear Rama, there will be no hunger or thirst to you."
Bala Kanda,22,15,"""And if these twin teachings are practised an inestimable renown will also accrue, oh, Raghu's legatee, these two hymns that possess brilliance are the daughters of Forefather Brahma, and oh, Rama of Kakutstha, I intend to impart these hymns to you, oh virtuous one, as you are the most eligible one, hence take the teachings that are kept safe from the world. [1-22-18, 19a]"
Bala Kanda,22,16,"""Though all of these numerous qualities are undoubtedly available with you, that too in abundance, yet these hymns if ascetically nurtured will yield various results."" Thus spoke Sage Vishvamitra to Rama. [1-22-19b, 20a]"
Bala Kanda,22,17,"Then Rama on touching water to purify himself received those teachings from the contemplative soul Vishvamitra with gladness beaming on his face. [1-22-20b, 21a]"
Bala Kanda,22,18,"Rama, the one with marvellous valiance, on obtaining those teachings performed all his duties of a student in respect of a teacher and then shone forth like the thousand rayed sun on a cloudless sky of autumn. Then those three very happily stayed on the riverbank of Sarayu for that night. [1-22-21b, 22]"
Bala Kanda,22,24,"Though both Rama and Lakshmana slept on an undeserving grass bed, nestled by the comfortable words of Vishvamitra that night is as though pleasant to the noteworthy children of Dasharatha."
Bala Kanda,22,20,"Sage Vishvamitra is the Seer for Gayatri hymn. He is the same Sage to impart bala atibala hymns to Rama and Lakshmana. For those readers that are interested to know or to practice, the Upanishad of bala atibala is included hereunder. This hymn is yet another aspect of Gayatri, and there is no hymn superior than Gayatri, na gaayatriyaaH paramam japam"
Bala Kanda,23,1,"At dawn after that night the great saint Vishvamitra spoke to the legatees of Kakutstha, Rama and Lakshmana, those that are sleeping on a grass bed."
Bala Kanda,23,2,"""Fortunate is Kausalya to beget you as her son Rama... get up oh, tigerly-man, eastern aurora is emerging, daytime tasks towards gods are to be performed."""
Bala Kanda,23,3,"On hearing the benign words of the sage those valorous and best ones among men got up, bathed, and on offering water oblation they mediated upon the supreme hymn, namely Gayatri."
Bala Kanda,23,4,"On performing their dawn time duties those two stalwarts, Rama and Lakshmana, enthusiastically presented themselves before the ascetically rich sage Vishvamitra for further journey, duly venerating him."
Bala Kanda,23,5,"Then on travelling some more distance those two great valiant ones, there they have seen the divine river that courses in three ways, namely Ganga, at the auspicious confluence of River Sarayu."
Bala Kanda,23,6,"There they have seen the merited hermitage of sages with contemplative souls, and who are practising supreme ascesis for many thousand years."
Bala Kanda,23,7,On seeing that merited hermitage Rama and Lakshmana are highly pleased and said this word to that great-soul Sage Vishvamitra.
Bala Kanda,23,8,"""Whose hermitage is this merited one? Indeed who is the celebrity that lives therein? Oh, godly sage, we are interested to listen, and we are truly inquisitive about it."" Thus they asked."
Bala Kanda,23,9,"On hearing their words the eminent sage Viswamitra said smilingly, "" whose hermitage is this in earlier times that may be listened."" Thus Vishvamitra started to narrate."
Bala Kanda,23,10,"""When Love-god was with his body wise men used to call him Kama, the passion. At this place, that Love-god with his naughty intent braved god of gods Shiva who had been practising ascesis and who concentrated observantly, and who was returning after his marriage along with his followers, namely the Wind-gods, and that great soul Shiva disapprovingly roared at Love-god. [1-23-10, 11]"
Bala Kanda,23,12,"""And Rama, the wrathful third-eye of Shiva destroyed the lewd-minded Love-god making all his limbs to fall down from his body."
Bala Kanda,23,13,"""There the body of Love-god is evanesced when that great soul Shiva burnt it down, and by the anger of that god of gods Shiva, Love-god is rendered as a bodiless entity."
Bala Kanda,23,14,"Then onwards Love-god is renowned as Ananga, as he is without body, and where his body is given up that is renowned as Anga province."
Bala Kanda,23,15,"""This merited hermitage thus belongs to Shiva and, oh, brave Rama, these sages abiding in virtue are Shiva's disciples at one time, thus sin is unverifiable with them."
Bala Kanda,23,16,"""Let us stay for this night in this hermitage situated in between two meritorious rivers Ganga and Sarayu, oh, Rama with auspicious mien, tomorrow we will cross over the River Ganga."
Bala Kanda,23,16,"""Let us all purify ourselves by taking our bath, performing our meditations, offering our daily oblations, and then let us enter this meritorious hermitage, thus our stay in here will be comforting to us."" So said Vishvamitra to Rama and Lakshmana. [1-23-17, 18a]"
Bala Kanda,23,17,"When they are discussing there the sages of that hermitage are highly gladdened to perceive them with their sixth-sense, and on approaching them enchantedly they offered water for hands and feet wash and then offered hospitality firstly to Sage Vishvamitra. [1-23-18, 19]"
Bala Kanda,23,20,"Afterwards those sages of that hermitage have accorded reception to Rama and Lakshmana, and applauded by Vishvamitra for their hospitality those sages have entertained Rama and other guests with myths and legends."
Bala Kanda,23,21,"Those sages with concentrated minds and according to one's own aptitude have meditated upon the deity of sunset when it is sundown, followed by Rama and others. Then led into hermitage by those sages who are with pious commitments and who are dwelling there, Rama and others have very comfortably stayed in the precincts of Shiva's hermitage."
Bala Kanda,23,22,"Staying very comfortably in the precincts of Kaama hermitage, then that virtuous sage Vishvamitra, saint the eminent, delighted the delightful princes with delighting stories....."
Bala Kanda,24,1,"Then, in the fresh of the morning those enemy destroyers, Rama and Lakshmana, arrived at the riverbank of Ganga keeping sage Vishvamitra ahead of them, which sage has just completed his ritualistic chores of dawn."
Bala Kanda,24,2,"All those sages of Kaama's hermitage that are the great souls and scrupulous ones in their vows, have positioned an auspicious ferryboat within the reach in the river, and then they said to sage Vishvamitra."
Bala Kanda,24,3,"""You may board the boat keeping the princes ahead of you, and we wish you to proceed on a prosperous route without the shift of time."" So said the sages."
Bala Kanda,24,4,"Sage Vishvamitra on saying 'it must be so,' to those sages and revering them in his turn, cruised the river that itself is cruising towards ocean, along with both the princes."
Bala Kanda,24,5,"On coming to the midstream of water there Rama heard an unusual and increasing noise of gushy waters along with his younger brother, and that brilliant one Rama desired to know its significance. [1-24-5, 6a]"
Bala Kanda,24,6,"Rama then asked the eminent sage Vishvamitra in the midst of the river, ""what is this turbulent sound sire, as though slashing water?"" [1-24-6b, 7a]"
Bala Kanda,24,7,"On hearing the inquisitive words of Raghava that virtue-souled sage Vishvamitra started to tell the significance of that sound. [1-24-7b, 8a]"
Bala Kanda,24,8,"""On Mt. Kailash Brahma created a great lake at his will, oh, tigerly-man Rama, hence that is called Maanasa Lake. [1-24-8b, 9a]"
Bala Kanda,24,9,"""That river which spontaneously flows out of that Maanasa Lake surrounds Ayodhya city is this one, the River Sarayu. Because this has originated from a lake, saraH, this is known as Sarayu. And because it flows from Brahma's Lake it is a merited river. This is the remarkable noise of such a Sarayu River in its coursing towards River Ganga, generated by the collision of their waters, and Rama, offer regards to these rivers, respectfully."" So said Vishvamitra to the princes. [1-24-9b, 10, 11a]"
Bala Kanda,24,10,"Offering their salutations to River Sarayu and Ganga those two most virtuous and agile footed princes proceeded further on reaching the southern riverbank. [1-24-11b, 12a]"
Bala Kanda,24,11,"On seeing a horrendous and uninhibited forest, Rama, the son of the best king Dasharatha asked the eminent sage Vishvamitra. [1-24-12b, 13a]"
Bala Kanda,24,12,"""Oh, impenetrable is this forest fraught with swarms of crickets, brutish predators, and vultures, which are all horribly strident. [1-24-13b, 14a]"
Bala Kanda,24,13,"""Various vultures are screeching with fierce sonority, and tigers, wild boars, and elephants render this forest atypical. [1-24-14b, 15a]"
Bala Kanda,24,14,"""Indeed, what is this wretched forest that is dense with Dhava, Ashvakarna, Arjuna, Bilva, Tinduka, Patala, and Badari trees."" Thus Rama asked Vishvamitra. [1-24-15b, 16a]"
Bala Kanda,24,15,"The resplendent and the great saint Vishvamitra then said to Rama, ""I will tell you, oh, my boy Rama, whose is this wretched forest. [1-24-16b, 17a]"
Bala Kanda,24,16,"""Once these were vast provinces, oh, best one among men, designed by gods and known as Malada and Karuusha. [1-24-17b, 18a]"
Bala Kanda,24,17,"""Once upon a time, oh, Rama, mortal impurities of filth and hunger completely stained Indra when he eliminated demon Vritra, as he committed the sin of killing of a Brahman, where the demon Vritra was incidentally a Brahman. [1-24-18b, 19a]"
Bala Kanda,24,18,"""The gods and ascetically rich sages then started to bathe feculent Indra with their handy vessels for the riddance of his defilement. [1-24-19b, 20a]"
Bala Kanda,24,19,"""On giving filth and hunger emerged out of the body of Mahendra here on the earth then the gods were gladdened. [1-24-20b, 21a]"
Bala Kanda,24,20,"""As and when Indra was without desecration and hunger as well, and thus purified, then gladdened about this place he gave it an unexcelled boon. [1-24-21b, 22a]"
Bala Kanda,24,21,"""These provinces that bear the impurity of my body shall become resourceful and they shall attain renown in world as Malada and Karusha."" Thus Indra gave boon to this place. [1-24-22b, 23a]"
Bala Kanda,24,22,"""On observing the honour accorded by wise Indra to these places gods praised the controller of demon Paaka, namely Indra saying, 'splendid, splendid it is.' [1-24-23b, 24a]"
Bala Kanda,24,23,"""For a long time these habitations Malada and Karuusha were affluent, oh, enemy subjugator Rama, and people were happy with wealth and provisions. [1-24-24b, 25a]"
Bala Kanda,24,24,"""Later at sometime, a yaksha female who is a guise changer at her wish, possessor of the strength of a thousand elephants, wife of clever Sunanda, and she whose son is demon Mareecha, the one equal to Indra in his bravery, prevailed here, let you be safe Rama. [1-24-25b, 26, 27a]"
Bala Kanda,24,25,"""That demon Mareecha is round shouldered, huge headed, cavernous mouthed, and gigantic bodied one, and he is always terrifying the people. [1-24-27b, 28a]"
Bala Kanda,24,26,"""And Raghava, that malevolent Tataka is always destroying the inhabitations at Malada and Karusha. [1-24-28b, 29a]"
Bala Kanda,24,27,"""She lives about one and half yojana distance from here, and by which reason this became the forest of Tataka, owing to her gruesome activities, for that reason only a headway is to be made, to eradicate her and her activities. [1-24-29b, 30a]"
Bala Kanda,24,28,"""Depending upon the strength of your own self-confidence you have to eradicate this evildoer, and assigned by me you have to make this province free from thorniness. [1-24-30b, 31a]"
Bala Kanda,24,29,"""Indeed, none is able to enter this sort of province, Rama, destroyed by the hazardous and invincible unearthly being who turned into a demoness, namely Tataka, hence you have to make the provinces habitable. [1-24-31b, 32a]"
Bala Kanda,24,32,"""As to how that ghoulish Tataka destroyed this entire forest, rendering it as a devastated place, without refraining from it even today, all that is narrated."" So said Vishvamitra to Rama."
Bala Kanda,25,1,"On hearing the worthy words of that sage with inestimable power, then the manly-tiger Rama replied him with estimable words."
Bala Kanda,25,2,"""It is said that yaksha's strength is trivial, and this is an yakshii, more so a female, how then this yakshii frail by her femineity can exert the strength of a thousand elephants?"
Bala Kanda,25,3,"On hearing the sentence of Raghava with illimitable dynamism, Vishvamitra said this sentence to the enemy subduer Rama along with Lakshmana, cheering them up with his pleasant words, ""Listen by which a female became outstanding by her strength... she assumes strength by the bestowal of a boon. [1-25-3, 4]"
Bala Kanda,25,5,"""Once there was a formidable yaksha named Suketu, but he was childless, and he who had devout conduct performed a great ascesis."
Bala Kanda,25,6,"""Gladdening at his ascesis, Rama, then the Forefather Brahma gave him a gemlike daughter who is renowned by the name of Tataka."
Bala Kanda,25,7,"""Forefather Brahma also gave the strength of a thousand elephants to her, but he that highly remarkable Brahma did not give a son to that yaksha, anticipating male to be more hazardous."
Bala Kanda,25,8,"""When that bright girl is growing up into a youthful beauty her father Suketu gave her to Jambha's son Sunda as wife."
Bala Kanda,25,9,"""Then after sometime that yakshii Tataka delivered an indomitable son named Mareecha, who by curse became a demon."
Bala Kanda,25,10,"""But when Sunda is eliminated by sage Agastya's curse, she that Tataka wished to retaliate that eminent sage along with her son Mareecha."
Bala Kanda,25,10,"""With desperation brewing in her she roaringly rushed towards the sage as though to eat him away, and on seeing her rushing along with her son Mareecha towards him, the godly saint Agastya firstly cursed Mareecha saying, 'you will attain demon-hood.' [1-25-11, 12a]"
Bala Kanda,25,11,"""Highly infuriated sage Agastya even cursed Tataka saying, 'forthwith divested of this form of a beautiful female, oh, great yakshii, you shall become a man eater with your form distorted, face contorted, and shape monstrous.' [1-25-12b, 13]"
Bala Kanda,25,14,"""Frenzied by the curse and convulsed in fury she that Tataka is thus vandalising this auspicious province, in which sage Agastya once sauntered."
Bala Kanda,25,15,"""She that highly atrocious one is with horrific behaviour and malefic valour, hence you shall eliminate this yakshii for the welfare of Brahmans and cows."
Bala Kanda,25,16,"""Excepting you there is none to eliminate her who is indomitably sheathed in a curse, oh, Raghu's legatee, and none in the three worlds can possibly brave her."
Bala Kanda,25,17,"""Compassion regarding the elimination of a female is ungermane, oh, best one among men, since a prince has to effectuate it intending the welfare of four categories of society."
Bala Kanda,25,18,"""For the reason of protecting people, a protector always has to execute such deed, either it is ruthless or humane, sinful or vilifying."
Bala Kanda,25,19,"""To the nominee who bears the burden of kingdom this is the age-old duty, and hence oh, Rama, the legatee of Kakutstha, eliminate this infamy, as goodness is inevident in her, isn't it."
Bala Kanda,25,20,"""Oh, Rama, the protector of people, we have heard that Indra once eliminated Manthara, the daughter of Virochana, when she wished to annihilate earth, haven't we."
Bala Kanda,25,21,"""And Rama, once Vishnu wiped out even the wife of sage Bhrigu and sage Shukracarya's mother when she wished the world to become one without a governing factor, namely Indra."
Bala Kanda,25,22,"""Oh, prince, these great souls and many other celebrated personalities have eliminated females who deported themselves with unrighteousness, and hence, oh, Rama, the protector of people, by my decree you leave off compassion and eliminate her."" Thus said sage Vishvamitra to Rama regarding Tataka's elimination."
Bala Kanda,26,1,"On hearing the words of that unfaltering sage about demoness Tataka, Raghava, best man's son who is firm in his vows, reverently adjoining his palms replied the sage."
Bala Kanda,26,2,"""Upon my father's order, upon my honour to my father's word, and looking upon this as the word of sage Kushi's son, my mentor, this task is definitely to be implemented."
Bala Kanda,26,3,"""What my great souled father Dasharatha directed me to do among elders in Ayodhya, that word too cannot be disregarded."
Bala Kanda,26,4,"""Such as I am, I will undertake the primary duty of eliminating Tataka, according as the follower of father's words, and according to the instruction of a Brahma scholar, such as your are, without a doubt."
Bala Kanda,26,5,"""I am ready to effectuate the bidding of an inestimable sage like you, for the welfare of cows and Brahmans, and for the advantage of this province."" So said Rama to sage Vishvamitra."
Bala Kanda,26,6,"Saying thus, Rama, the enemy-destroyer, clenched his left fist on the handgrip in the middle of the bow, and with the right he made a thunderous sound of the bowstring making all the directions to blast."
Bala Kanda,26,7,"By that sound the inhabitants of Tataka forest are startled, and even Tataka is stupefied by that sound, and she is intolerably infuriated at it."
Bala Kanda,26,8,She who is convulsed in anger to hear that sound gave attention to the direction wherefrom it emerged and she rancorously rushed thereto.
Bala Kanda,26,9,"Raghava on seeing that monstrous-looking demoness with a distorted face and who by proportions is very gigantic, furthermore infuriated, spoke to Lakshmana."
Bala Kanda,26,10,"""Lakshmana, see that yakshii's grisly and ghastly physique, seeing which hearts of cowards are prone to burst."
Bala Kanda,26,11,""" She is unstoppable and has magical powers, is't, you may see now how I will make her to readily retreat by lopping off her ears and the tip of nose."
Bala Kanda,26,12,"""As it is her feminineness is protecting her, and I too I do not really attempt to kill her, but I intend to terminate her impudence and mobility."
Bala Kanda,26,13,"While Rama is still speaking that way, convulsed in anger Tataka roaringly rushed towards Rama alone, swinging her arms."
Bala Kanda,26,14,"But the Brahma-sage Vishvamitra daunted sounded her off and said to Rama and Lakshmana, ""let you be safe, and be victorious."""
Bala Kanda,26,15,"Flinging up dreadful dust on those two Raghavaa-s, Tataka baffled them for a while with a massive cloud of dust."
Bala Kanda,26,16,"Then taking hold of witchery she inundated both the Raghava-s with highly torrential stone rain, by which Rama became indignant."
Bala Kanda,26,17,"On forestalling her effusive stone storming with his arrow storm, Rama even mutilated both of her arms with arrows while she rushed towards them."
Bala Kanda,26,18,"With her arms severed and fatigued she started to roar extremely at the nearby, and then provoked Lakshmana made her to loose her ears and the tip of nose by cutting them off."
Bala Kanda,26,19,"That guise changer vanished after variously altering her aspects, and then on baffling them with her illusoriness and discharging stone storms she moved about appallingly. [1-26-19, 20a]"
Bala Kanda,26,20,"And on seeing both Rama and Lakshmana who are being overspread by storms of stones from all-over, then the illustrious sage Vishvamitra spoke this sentence. [1-26-20b, 21a]"
Bala Kanda,26,21,"""Enough is your compassion Rama, she is a sinister, behaviourally malevolent, a hinderer of rituals, and this yakshii gets a grip on herself in a short time by her illusory powers. [1-26-21b, 22a]"
Bala Kanda,26,22,"""Sun is going to set in a short time, and only before that time she shall be destroyed, for demons at dusk and afterwards become unassailable, indeed."" So said sage Viswamitra to Rama. [1-26-22b, 23a]"
Bala Kanda,26,23,"When Vishvamitra addressed him thus, Rama displaying his capacity in sonic archery forestalled that yakshii who has gone into invisibility and storming stone-storms, with his arrows. [1-26-23b, 24a]"
Bala Kanda,26,24,"And when the arrays of arrows obstructed her who possesses illusional powers, she dashed towards Rama and Lakshmana blaring stridently. [1-26-24b, 25a]"
Bala Kanda,26,25,"And Rama struck an arrow in her chest who is invading and speedily swooping down like a thunderbolt, and thus she is readily felled down and totally dropped dead, too. [1-26-25b, 26a]"
Bala Kanda,26,26,"On seeing her who is horrendous in her shape is eliminated Indra and other gods have highly esteemed Rama saying, ?admirable, admirable is this act. [1-26-26b, 27a]"
Bala Kanda,26,27,"The thousand eyed and the destroyer of enemy?s citadels Indra then spoke with high satisfaction, and even all of the gods are gladdened and said to Vishvamitra this way. [1-26-27b, 28a]"
Bala Kanda,26,28,"""Oh, sage Vishvamitra, you are blessed, all the groups of wind-gods along with Indra are pleased, so you please show more concern for Raghava. [1-26-28b, 29a]"
Bala Kanda,26,29,"""The sons of Prajapati Krishasva who are valiant by their virtue and who possess ascetic strength, oh, Brahman, they may be offered to Raghava. [1-26-29,b, 30a]"
Bala Kanda,26,30,"""Rama is steadfast in following your assignments and thus he is the worthy receiver of those missiles, and this prince has to accomplish a very great deed of gods.? So said gods to Vishvamitra. [1-26-30b, 31a]"
Bala Kanda,26,31,"All the gods on saying thus and on extolling Vishvamitra they contentedly returned to heavens, and then the sunset has come to pass. [1-26-31b, 32a]"
Bala Kanda,26,32,"That best sage is satisfied with Rama and gladdened for the eradication of Tataka kissed the forehead of and then said this sentence. [1-26-32b, 33a]"
Bala Kanda,26,33,"""Here we stay for tonight, Rama, the august one for a gaze, and tomorrow morning we will go to that hermitage of mine.? So said Vishvamitra to Rama. [1-26-33b, 34a]"
Bala Kanda,26,34,"On listening sage Vishvamitra's words, Dasharatha's son Rama, comfortably stayed that night there in that forest of Tataka."
Bala Kanda,26,35,"On that very day alone that forest of Tataka too is released from the curse, and it shone forth like the luxurious heavenly garden of Kubera, namely Chiatra Ratha. [1-26-35b, c]"
Bala Kanda,26,36,"Rama while being eulogised by the groups of celestials and liberated Souls for complete elimination of yaksha's daughter, namely Tataka, stayed there along with the sage only to be awakened by the next day?s sunrise."
Bala Kanda,27,1,"Then, on staying that night there in Tataka forest, on the next day morning the greatly renowned sage Vishvamitra, smilingly and wording sweetly spoke to Rama."
Bala Kanda,27,2,"""I am highly pleased with you, oh, illustrious prince Rama, let safety be with you, I will now give you all of the divine missiles in utmost fondness of mine."
Bala Kanda,27,3,"""I am going to accord all of those divine missiles by which scores of gods, demons, or even from gandharva-s, uragaa-s and the like, or even earthlings are dominated, humbled down and conquered in war. Let safety be with you. [1-27-3, 4a]"
Bala Kanda,27,4,"""Raghava, I am going to give the highly divine Danda disc [Punisher disc]; next, oh, best one among men, Dharma disc [Virtue-disc,] and like that kaala disc [Time-disc]; then oh, brave one, Vishnu disc; similarly oh, dextrous Rama, Indra disc and Thunderbolt missile; the best trident pertaining to Shiva; the missile called Brahma-shira [Brahma-crest]; the missile called the Aishiika missile [Grass-Blade missile,] and that way oh, Raghava, I am going to give the unexcelled and highly formidable missile called Brahma missile.

Bala Kanda,30,4,"""Oh, Raghava-s, you have to safeguard this ritual for six nights and days from today, and this Sage Vishvamitra who is under the vow of ritual goes into muteness as required by the vow."" Thus said the other sages near at ritual place."
Bala Kanda,30,5,On hearing that sentence of the other sages those two glorious princes have wakefully safeguarded that woodland of the ritual for six nights and days.
Bala Kanda,30,6,On alertly patrolling nearby the Altar of Fire those two enemy-destroyers who are the wielders of great bows and valiant ones have protected the best sage Vishvamitra.
Bala Kanda,30,7,"While that period of six days is elapsing and when the sixth day has come, then Rama said to Saumitri, ""you be prepared and be on alert."""

Bala Kanda,30,10,"While the Vedic ritual is proceeding well towards its conclusion according to hymnal rendering and rules of conducting the ritual, a strident and frightening blare is generated in the sky."
Bala Kanda,30,11,"As to how massive clouds appear in torrential cloudburst, likewise two demons appeared enshrouding the sky, and performing wizardry they are about to swoop down towards the Altar of Fire."
Bala Kanda,30,12,Maareecha and Subaahu are the monstrous demons that have come along with their followers and they have started to pour down spates of blood.
Bala Kanda,30,13,"On noticing the Altar of Fire swamped with streams of blood, then Rama swiftly ran towards that direction and saw the demons in the sky."
Bala Kanda,30,14,"Perceiving that the two demons are about to swoop down on Altar of Fire in haste, that lotus-eyed Rama however gave a quick checking look at Lakshmana saying this sentence."
Bala Kanda,30,15,"""Lakshmana, I am reluctant to eliminate this kind of these ill-behaved and raw flesh eating demons, but no doubt, they will be puffed out with Manava missile like a gust puffing thick clouds, you may see."" Thus Rama said to Lakshmana. [1-30-15, 16a]"
Bala Kanda,30,16,"Saying so that agile Rama fitted the very benign and highly radiant arrow Maanava on his bow, and taking aim with it at Maareecha that highly furious Raghava darted it on the chest of Maareecha. [1-30-16b, 17]"
Bala Kanda,30,18,"Cleanly hit with that great missile Maanava, demon Maareecha is pitched for a hundred yojana lengths in full, and flung down into an ocean rocking with tidewaters."

Bala Kanda,30,20,"""Lakshmana, see the Cold arrow belonging to Maanava missile expounded by Manu which is taking him away on baffling, but without taking away his life."
Bala Kanda,30,21,"""But I wish to kill these demons for they are ruthless, iniquitous, flagitious, ritual-hinderers and blood-drinkers."" So said Rama to Lakshmana."
Bala Kanda,30,22,"Thus saying to Lakshmana, as though to show his swift dexterity Rama, the descendent of Raghu dynasty, took up a very powerful missile called Aagneya astra, Fire-missile, and darted it on the chest of Subaahu, by which that demon Subaahu is struck and fell flat on ground."
Bala Kanda,30,23,In order to bring felicity to the sages that great glorious and supremely generous Raghava took up the missile of Air-god and hit down the remaining demons.
Bala Kanda,30,24,"When Rama, the delight of Raghu's dynasty, has eliminated all of the demons that are the hinderers of Vedic rituals, the sages available there in that hermitage idealised him as Indra was idealised once, when he became victories on demons."
Bala Kanda,30,25,On the completion of ritual beholding the precincts that are devoid of calamities the great sage Vishvamitra said this to Rama.
Bala Kanda,30,26,"""My purpose in conducting the ritual is fully realised, oh, dextrous Rama, and you too, as a highly illustrious prince, have actualised the word of honour of your mentor, where one mentor is your father King Dasharatha and the other is myself, and likewise oh, valiant Rama the glory of this Accomplished hermitage is also actualised..."" thus when Vishvamitra is applauding Rama, they have come close to vesper-time for vespertine prayers on Sandhya, the goddess of gloaming."
Bala Kanda,31,1,"Rejoicing for achieving the result of their journey with Vishvamitra, the brave Rama and Lakshmana then resided in that hermitage for that night, gladdening in their heart of hearts."

Bala Kanda,73,7,"Then king Dasharatha on seeing the adorable guest who arrived in his presence, and who is a merited one for adoration, Dasharatha adored Yudhaajit well, with full observances. [1-73-6b, 7a]"
Bala Kanda,73,8,"Then on taking rest for that night along with his noble-minded sons, and again on getting up in the next morning, and on performing morning-observances as a duty-bound king, Dasharatha arrived at the hall of Vedic-ritual, keeping the sages in his forefront. [1-73-7b-8]"
Bala Kanda,73,9,"Rama arrived at his father together with all of his brothers, keeping sage Vashishta and other eminent-saint ahead of them, on an opportune and appropriate hour called 'Victory...' and all the bridegrooms are adorned with all kinds of jewellery appropriate for the wedding time, and all have performed the auspicious ceremony for marriage-thread, conducted prior to the marriage and, all have thread-bands tied around their wrists, as they all have performed an auspicious ceremony antecedent to marriage ceremony. [1-73-9, 10a]"
Bala Kanda,73,10,"Then that godly sage Vashishta on going from Vedic-ritual hall to marriage hall said this to Janaka, ""Oh, best one among best people, oh, king Janaka, having performed the auspicious marriage-thread ceremony, Dasharatha along with his sons is looking forward for the donor... [1-73-10b, 11]"
Bala Kanda,73,12,"""In marriages all the puruSaartha-s , the component values of life, namely rightness, riches, revelries, and results of final release will be occurring only if the benefactor and beneficiary meet, isn't it. Hence let king Dasharatha come, and then on actualising this best marriage you too will be doing your best devoir as royal priest..."
Bala Kanda,73,13,"Janaka is not just a decidedly valiant king but he is the profound knower of probity also, besides being an unreservedly generous king, hence he has already made all arrangements, and when he is spoken in this way by Vashishta that king replied this sentence to that right honourable Vashishta."
Bala Kanda,73,14,"""Who is that doorman that prevents your entry? Or, for whose orders you all await with a bated breath? Do you hesitate in your own house, or what? This kingdom is as good as yours... isn't so..."
Bala Kanda,73,15,"""Oh, eminent-saint Vashishta, on absolutely performing the auspicious ceremony for the marriage-thread, and thereby tying thread-band at wrists my daughters have already arrived, and they are at the base of the Altar of Fire, like the irradiant jets of flames of radiant fire..."
Bala Kanda,73,16,"""I am already ready and awaiting for you remaining at this Altar of Fire. Let everything be done indeed without any deterrents. What for the king Dasharatha is dawdling..."" So said Janaka to Vashishta."
Bala Kanda,73,17,"On hearing that sentence of Janaka, then Dasharatha started towards marriage hall, and then he started to enter his sons one by one, four in all, into marriage hall along with all of the assemblages of sages."
Bala Kanda,73,17,"Then that king from Videha bloodline, Janaka, said in this way to Vashishta, ""Oh, the knower of punctilios, oh, Brahma-sage, oh, masterly sage, along with other sages you make happen all of the marriage ceremonies of Rama, the rejoicer of the world..."" Thus Janaka spoke to Vashishta. [1-73-18, 19a]"
Bala Kanda,73,18,"Thus said, that godly sage Vashishta on saying, ""so be it,"" to Janaka, embarked on arranging Altar of Fire keeping sage Vishvamitra and the virtuous sage Shataananda afore of him, and that sage with great ascesis, Vashishta, has arranged an Altar of Fire in the midpoint of the cool-thatched manorial-marriage-shed, decorating it with sandal paste and flowers. Then he promptly sanctified variously coloured handy vessels, and lid-like concave earthen vessels, which are full with just sprouted sprigs, and he sanctified even other golden vessels, censers with fumes of incenses, conch-shell like vessels, and short handled wooden scoops for scooping oblatory items from vessels for putting it in long-handled scoops, and long-handled wooden scoops to drop those oblatory items into Ritual-fire, and vessels filled with oblatory items like ghee, water, milk etc., and vessels filled with toasted rice-flakes and vessels filled with holy yellow-rice duly treated with turmeric, and he sanctified all articles of wedding ceremony by sprinkling holy-yellow-rice, as a kind of dry-ablution. [1-73-19b, 20, 21, 22, 23a]"
Bala Kanda,73,19,"Then that great resplendent and eminent-saint Vashishta neatly overlaid even-sized sacred grass on that Altar of Fire synchronising with Vedic-chants, and on preparing Ritual-fire by rubbing two wooden sticks, called araNi , he placed that fire in the pit of Altar, which is aflame now, and then reverently and in tune with the Vedic-hymns he effused oblational liquids into that Altar of Fire, with short-handled and long-handled wooden scoops. [1-73-23b, 24]"
Bala Kanda,73,20,"Then that king Janaka led forth Seetha, who by now is decorated with every variety of bridal jewellery, and on positioning her en face Raghava in the presence of Altar of Fire, then Janaka addressed Rama who is the enhancer of his mother Kausalya's rejoice. [1-73-25, 26a]"

Bala Kanda,73,24,"The above is very a convenient and readymade gist of that verse. But the three pronouns in the first stanza iyam, mama, tava 'this, mine, yours' are supposed to play havoc in deciphering the latent meaning of this verse. Let us look at some of them."
Bala Kanda,73,25,"Seetha is very much there in the front of Rama, and Janaka might have shown her and told ""take her...' Why this iyam i.e., ""this"" It is explained as below:"
Bala Kanda,73,26,"Janaka: This and this alone is Seetha, the unique, exceptional and earmarked one for you... do not confuse yourself by looking at Urmila, Maandavi and Shrutakiirti they are for your brothers"
Bala Kanda,73,27,Rama: Why she alone is earmarked for me?
Bala Kanda,73,28,Janaka: Because she is 'Seetha '
Bala Kanda,73,29,"Rama: What, you mean a furrow, or a sillion..."
Bala Kanda,73,30,"[Sillion is an old word for furrow, not found in dictionaries, but used by poet Hopkins in his 'The Windhover' ' sheer plod makes plough down sillion /]"
Bala Kanda,73,31,"Janaka: Yes, everything comes out of earth... from coal to gold, flora to fauna, rivers to ridges everything.... a morsel of food comes from a handful of mud in this mortal world.... your being, becoming and belonging in, are manifest only because of that earth and earth enables you to live on her without seeking any requital or reciprocation and earth is the symbol of enduing toleration, though you dig, dung or dredge it.... hence, Seetha is the symbol for mortal truth, and mortally tolerant womanhood and you people want to know the Unknown in the skies, but do not wish to know what that is right under your feet... vedaa aham etam puruSham mahaantam aaditya varNam tamasaH parastaat | if the Supreme Person beyond darkness is knowable, and sages like Vishvamitra know you and tell that you are some Super Soul aham vedmi mahaatmaanaam raamam satya paraakramam - bala 19-14 likewise you shall know iyam siitaa, for she is somebody to match you... have you not mugged up Veda-s, Upanishad-s"
Bala Kanda,73,32,"Rama: Why not every bit of it... you name, it I tell it"
Bala Kanda,73,33,Janaka: How does the fifth mantra of eighth topic in Chaandogya Upanishad reads?
Bala Kanda,73,34,"Adi Shankara's commentary: There are three letters that denote the Absolute sa, ta, yam; and the syllable ii on sat is for easy pronunciation. The letter sa indicates immortality and the word ta mortality, and the syllable yam conditions and bridges both the above ' Ramanuja comment: The letter sat is immortality and the letter ti is mortality and yam conditions both, hence sattiyam is indicative of Spiritedness and non-spiritedness ' Madhvaacaarya says: sat, delivered immortal souls; ti yet to be delivered bounded souls; yam both the delivered and bounded souls."
Bala Kanda,73,35,"Janaka: Seetha is that yam the conjunctive, conditioner, bridge between the mortal and immortal, setu - eSa setu iti vidharaNa the presiding deity of catana acetana dynamic, static beings. oh, Rama, it is said in Vishnu Puraana that Seetha is your lookalike, minus your sky-blue complexion, raaghavatve bhavet siitaa... It is said in yet another scripture, yatha mayaa jagat vyaaptam - sva ruupeNa svabhaavataH | tayaa vyaaptam idam vishvam niyantrii ca tathaa iishvarii || 'as to how I am all pervading, likewise She, Goddess Lakshmi, is all pervading and the controller of the universe ' and if you want to establish yourself as the protector of this world, you have to take this and this Seetha alone, as she is the cause for the desired effect of yours and, she is from Mother Earth ratna garbha and you are a sapphirine boy from a mother, and a sapphire shines only if it is studded in earth-given gold anargham api maaNikyam hema aashrayam apekshate otherwise you, your incarnation, your epic, your mission, why one or two, everything concerning you will be futile, and you have to return to your milky abode empty handed, and here on earth, every house breeds one or more Ravana-s"
Bala Kanda,73,36,Rama: How am I to conclude 'this' as 'that...' I mean Goddess Lakshmi
Bala Kanda,73,37,"Janaka: Certain aspects are to be inferred because they are unmanifest. Fire on the mountain is unmanifest but smoke is manifest, hence fire is inferred. So also, ayam iishvarii is manifest as iyam this girl... from siitaa furrow, sillion, a narrow trench in ground made by ploughshare... as a small seed manifests into a gigantic banyan tree, and from this the nature of her non-foetal birth, it is to be inferred likewise, and only because of it she is someone above mortals. Because you have come as a mortal she has to take birth as a mortal, as an inseparable entity of yours"
Bala Kanda,73,38,Rama: Then why can't she fall from sky or from other planet?
Bala Kanda,73,39,"Janaka: She cannot. Your connection with this earth is age-old and you love it. Because you love earth, she has to emerge from earth, a lovely act for you."
Bala Kanda,73,40,Rama: Then why mama sutaa... she can be fostered in any orphanage
Bala Kanda,73,41,"Janaka: Not so. An auspicious thing or being requires a sanctum sanctorum... Mithila is one such... and Videha-s are not just kings of this part of land, but they are priests of pious or holy things like the bow of Shiva. You know the naming of vi deha... it is not 'without bodies...' but transcending bodily affairs Thus she chose this as her background and as she presented herself to me as baby girl, I have look upon her as mama sutaa 'my daughter ' And many, many kings sought her hand in marriage, but I refused and they warred with me, whereby I had to call for the forces of gods to counterattack the enemy forces; perhaps, you might not have heard that humans can summon gods; thus gods are at my disposal; a prayer of mine brings them here, either for a war or for a ritual So, do not take me or my daughter Seetha, iyam siitaa mama sutaa as some ignoramus and insignificant dullards"
Bala Kanda,73,42,"Rama: Then why you want me to take back, as though she belonged to me for eons, but lost in a journey"
Bala Kanda,73,43,"Janaka: Yes, she is yours from ages unknown; I cannot donate her in kanyaa daana 'bestowal of bride ' because your marriage is eternal. But you two have arrived here in human forms, so conduct yourselves in conformity with human customs.... that is why I tell pratiicCha enaaam ' take her back, wishfully ' for that saying of mine get no anger on me; bhadram te 'let safeness betide' you; by this act of yours paaNim gR^ihNiSva paaNinaa ' you take her palm into your palm ' that which is customary in human paaNi grahaNa mahotsava 'wedding ceremony '; by the way, you always keep your consort in your heart hR^idaya kamala do not do such things as long as you are on earth for your incarnation will be disclosed.... just take her hand and let not this heavenly discourse be leaked out... lest Ravana may come to know that you are not human and it will be impossible for you to eliminate that evil, thereby"
Bala Kanda,73,44,And we now proceed to the human level import of this verse.
Bala Kanda,73,45,"Janaka: 'iyam ""this girl"" who has --- mugdhamanoharamanoj~namohanaatmakasukumaarasoundaryalaavaNyaadau--- a beauty par excellence [and par problmatique beauty as well, for Ravana alone has got more words to extol her beauty, as in Ch. 46 Aranya ];"
Bala Kanda,73,46,"so, iyam ""this one"" is about whom you have heard from day one in the hermitage of Siddha, i.e., when you started towards Mithila;"
Bala Kanda,73,47,"hence, iyam ""this one alone"" is that girl who is on your psyche from the minute you broke that Shiva's bow, and whom you are envisioning praasaade praade ca pathi pathi ca saa pR^iShTataH saa purataH 'on verandas of multistoried buildings and in window ledges, on this street and that street, before you, behind you ' during these days of your stay in Mithila...."
Bala Kanda,73,48,"Rama: No, No, No, you are wrong... I did not aim at any girl when aiming to lift that old bow... sorry for your unilateral conclusion..."
Bala Kanda,73,49,"Janaka: No, my dear boy, the condition I stipulated before your touching that bow is bilateral... I clearly said that my daughter belongs to one who can lift that bow... you were quick enough to grab the girl, rather than the bow... and in that hastiness you even broke that bow... had you declined the girl, you should have declined to lift the bow, also... so, iyam siita was the only intention of yours when lifting that bow..."
Bala Kanda,73,50,"Rama; Maybe.. but we want high-born, high-bred girls --- not fatherless, motherless, birth-less orphans"
Bala Kanda,73,39,"Janaka: You seem to be a doubting Thomas... that's why I said mama sutaa 'my daughter ' when it is said mahataa tapasaa raama... ' by high degree ascesis Dasharatha obtained Rama... what does it mean? So also, I too obtained and fostered this girl with much better ascesis [than your father], and even protected her from warring factions [only to give back to you ]; bythe way, the environ of Mithila itself is of utmost sanctity and piety... if we are to be lowly subjects, why your guru Vishvamitra brought you here, that too by foot don't think that you are taking this girl for your personal enjoyment, but it is for a caculated purpose... this girl meets that purpose and her wifehood, as well.... hence I said saha dharma carii tava ' she will be in toe with your duties' Or tava dharma saha carii ' whatever is your duty that duty become hers too '.. Rama: Somehow there appears some cacoethes confusion from you, from all the sages, from my father and mothers, even Janaka: Nothing of that sort is there... if you wish heartily then only you take her... I have not said siitaam dadaami 'I am donating Seetha ' but I said pratiicCha enaam 'take her, take her back ' or else, she will exit as she came and unfulfilled will be your mission... it is up to you to decide.... no compulsion whatsoever... Rama: Then, let her take hold of my arrow and walk with me round the Altar of Fire, because, for Kshatriya-s that is the custom... Janaka: I know, I know, but this marriage does not fit into any of the eight kinds of marriage prescribed for humans... hence I carefully said paaNim gR^ihNiiSva paaNinaa' take her palm into your palm ' The types of ancient marriages as laid down by scriptures are eight kinds. 1] braahmya: inviting a celibate scholar after completion of his Vedic studies, and offering a bride with due ceremony; 2] daiva: offering a bride to a ritwij when he is conducting a Vedic-ritual; 3] aarSa: giving the bride after donating a cow and ox for the success of Vedic-ritual; 4] praajaapatya: offering a bride without seeking anything from the bridegroom, to follow the course of dharma; 5] asura: giving ample money to bride's party or to bride and marrying her at costs; 6] gandharva: man and woman falling in love and marrying on their own, just out of lust and bodily pleasures; 7] raakshasa: if a bride or bride's part do not agree, by maltreating, torturing and terrorising them, and thereby seizing the bride; 8] paishaacika: while the girl is asleep, or making her drunk, or unconscious and then molesting her, by which she becomes a 'can't but' bride - a worst kind of marriage. eteShu aShTasu vivaaheShu ayam vivaaho na ko api bhavitum arhati - tat ukta lakShaNa a bhaavaat | tathaa hi - na taavat braahmyaH iti - aahuuya daana a bhaavaat | na api daivaH - kShatriyasya aartivijya a sambhavat | na aarSha - kanyaa pitro go mithuna go daana a bhaavaat | na api praajaapatyaH - viirya shulka iti kathanaat | na api aasuraH - kanyaa pituH dravya daana a bhaavaat | na api gaandharvaH paraspara anuraageNa samsarga a bhaavaat | na api raakShasaH - chedan hanana aadinaa prasahya kanya haraNa a bhaavaat | na api paishaaciH - sva apapramaada anyatam avasthaa a yuktayaaH | tasmaat katamo ayam vivaaha iti cet - saha dharma carii tava - iti uktyaa praajaapatya eva vivaahaH - dk And when none of the eight is unsuitable for Seetha's wedding it is brought under the fourth praajaapatya- because saha dharmam carati iti praajaapatya - aashvalaayana | samyoga mantraH praajaapatye saha dharmam caryataam - gautama | saha dharmama carataam iti praajaapatyam - bodhaayana | But here something is sought from the bridegroom, in the name of lifting the bow. But that is negated saying the 'seeking' is the seeking of material assets, not valour or bravery. It is namesake, and even the nomenclature that Seetha is the bounty for valour viirya shulkais a namesake; kShatriyeShu viirya vara eva shreShTatvaat taadR^ishaya kanyaam pradaatum viirya parishodhanam kR^itam iti shulka iti kathanaat shulka shabda aupacaarikaH | dk Hence this marriage is for implementation of righteousness and it is treated as extramundane and celebrated every year. Rama: This marriage does not fit into any category! Then why this marriage at all! Janaka: To be in tune with this world's tradition... however, this marriage technically comes under the category of praajaa patya Rama: So, you adjusted the rule books... then why me, let her take my hand... Janaka: The enjoyer has to grab the object of enjoyment, not vice versa... take her now and bhadram te and 'be blest ' --o)0(o-- Next, Janaka is asking the bridegroom like a poor Indian father to take a poor and motherless bride Seetha. Janaka: iyam - 'this' girl is a simple match to you who broke the bow of Shiva; siitaa' born in furrow' a motherless girl, hence, kindly be merciful towards her; mama sutaa ' my daughter ' rather, a poor fellow's daughter; where I have always been engaged in rituals and ceremonies, thereby I may not have brought her up properly, and thereby if she does talk rashly or behave oddly, like an ill-bred girl, kindly tolerate and correct her; saha dhrma carii iva where iva is ' like ' just take her like your 'custom-bound consort ' and let her be useful in ceremonies and rituals, though not for pleasure trips and excursions '; pratiicCha enaam 'take her ' where the bridegrooms usually woo, court and date girls, send many messages to her parents asking for that girl in marriage; but, this girl being an uncommon one, I am begging you to take her; paaNim gR^ihNiiSva paaNinaa you take her hand as she is hesitating to take your hand, for your hand is strong enough to break an unbreakable bow, she is fearing to take your hand, lest her arm too will be broken; bhadram te 'be blest ' when you honour our appeal --o)0(o-- And there are many, many more shades of meanings derived from this verse, but all culminate to say - 'you two are made for each other ' Verse Locator pativratÄ mahabhÄgÄ chhÄya iva anugatÄ sadÄ || 1-73-27 iti uktvÄ prÄká¹£hipat rÄjÄ maá¹tra pÅ«tam jalam tadÄ | 27b, 28a. mahabhaagaa = prosperous [Seetha will be]; pati vrataa = husband, devout; sadaa Chaaya iva = always, shadow, like; anugataa = follow [you]; iti uktvaa = thus, saying; raajaa = king; tadaa = then; mantra puutam jalam = hymn, sanctified, water; praakshipat = poured forth. ""She who is prosperous and husband-devout, will always be abiding you like your own shadow..."" So saying that king Janaka then poured forth water into the palms of Rama, which is sanctified with hymns. [1-73-27b, 28a] Pouring water at the time of donation into the donee's hand symbolises the free flowing will of the donor. The 'shadow' expresses nitya sambandhatva 'ever related entity...' Or, a trace of His liilaa vibhuuti, maaya. Though they are living separately so far, that farness is now washed off by this holy water.

Then there occurred great flower-showers from firmament, while sages and gods staying in firmament have exclaimed, ""nice... fine..."" to the drumbeats of heavenly drums. [1-3-28b, 29a] What happened to these gods when boyish Rama eliminated Tataka and others? Are they any lesser feats than this marriage? And why this drumming and showering flowers and blessings, when it is 'just' a human's marriage? Now the cause for the effect is conjoined to Rama to effectuate their plea to Brahma. If the entire arsenal given by Vishvamitra is set-aside for a moment, the 'present' now presented by Janaka is the ultimate weapon for the use against Ravana. aprameyam hi tat tejo yasya saa janaka aatmajaa 'unlimited is the energy, to whom Janaka's daughter belongs...' Rama is the instrumental cause in eliminating Ravana, whereas Seetha is the efficient cause for it. Lanka is ruined by Seetha, through Hanuma with the help of Fire-god, but not by Rama, or all of the monkeys put together. And Rama eliminates the half-dead Ravana. There are some more flower-showers and drumbeats and dances, later.

Next, another round of enkindling of holy fire took place in which Rama and brothers have offered marriage time oblations.

Then each couple had oblated rice-flakes into the fire, and again performed circumambulations to that Ritual-fire, respectively. Thus, the marriage is not a handshake like one-minute affair, as they all shall be before fire, daylong.

And why this drumming and showering flowers and blessings, when it is 'just' a human's marriage? Now the cause for the effect is conjoined to Rama to effectuate their plea to Brahma. If the entire arsenal given by Vishvamitra is set-aside for a moment, the 'present' now presented by Janaka is the ultimate weapon for the use against Ravana. aprameyam hi tat tejo yasya saa janaka aatmajaa 'unlimited is the energy, to whom Janaka's daughter belongs...' Rama is the instrumental cause in eliminating Ravana, whereas Seetha is the efficient cause for it. Lanka is ruined by Seetha, through Hanuma with the help of Fire-god, but not by Rama, or all of the monkeys put together. And Rama eliminates the half-dead Ravana.

Bala Kanda,74,7,"But while going with the assemblages of sages and with young Raghava-s, namely Rama, Lakshmana, Bharata, Shatrughna, the sky-bound birds started to screech with startling voice from all around facing that tigerly-man Dasharatha. [1-74-8b, 9a]"
Bala Kanda,74,8,"Also thus, all of the earth bound animals are going his leftward, and on seeing this, albeit he is a tigerly king he is perplexed, and particularly asked Vashishta. [1-74-9b, 10a]"
Bala Kanda,74,9,"""Unpropitious is the starling voicing of birds, whereby my heart is throbbing down... and propitious is the leftward going of the animals, thereby my heart is throbbing up... why so?"" [1-74-10b, 11a]"
Bala Kanda,74,10,"On hearing all that is said by king Dasharatha, the instinctual sage Vashishta said this sentence in a soothing voice, ""I will tell apart the result of these auguries... [1-74-11b, 12a]"
Bala Kanda,74,11,"""The shrieks voiced by the birds are foretokening the forthcoming providential and perilous trepidation, but the behaviour of these animals is betokening it as mitigable... hence, let this consternation be forsaken... [1-74-12b, 13a]"
Bala Kanda,74,12,"While they are discussing among themselves, a whirlwind started to whirligig there, as though to shake the earth and shatter all gigantic trees. [1-74-13b, 14a]"
Bala Kanda,74,13,"Murkiness enshrouded the sun, thus everyone is unaware of quarters, a sandstorm enwrapped that army, by which it has become as though ensorcelled. [1-74-14b, 15a]"
Bala Kanda,74,14,"Then Vashishta and the other sages, the king Dasharatha along with his sons remained there with animation, and everything and every other one available there has become inanimate. [1-74-15b, 16a]"
Bala Kanda,74,15,"In that catastrophic darkness, that sand-muffled military of king Dasharatha has seen the son of Sage Jamadagni, namely Bhaargava Rama, the subjugator of kings of kings. He appeared calamitous in his look by wearing tufty matted and unruly head-hair, an unassailable one like Mt. Kailash, an unbearable one like the Epoch-End-Fire, irradiant with his own radiance, hence imperceivable for commoners, and such as he is, he clinched an axe on his right shoulder and clasped a bow in his left hand, that in simile is like a congeries of electroluminescence, and handling an arrow which is as if ready to electrocute, and he vied in his overall look with the devastator of triple cities, namely God Shiva. [1-74-16b, 17, 18, 19]"
Bala Kanda,74,16,"On seeing him who is perilous in his propensity and flaming like the Ritual-fire, Vashishta and the other prominent Brahman-s who are the practisers of meditation and fire-oblations have come together and started to susurrate, up and down. [1-74-20, 21a]"
Bala Kanda,74,17,"""Will he eradicate the race of Kshatriya-s even now as he was once envenomed by the murder of his father, or what... abated is his anger and alleviated is his frenzy previously when he eliminated Kshatriya-s... but is he really intending to eliminate Kshatriya-s once again, or what?"" Thus, those Brahmans talked among themselves. [1-74-21b, 22]"
Bala Kanda,74,23,"After their susurrus the sages have approached him, who in his very look is like a visitation, with oblational water and addressed him with benign words of greeting like, ""oh, Rama, oh, Bhaargava Rama..."""
Bala Kanda,74,24,"On receiving the deference paid by the sage Vashishta, that inexorable Rama of Jamadagni started to talk to Rama of Dasharatha."
Bala Kanda,75,1,"""Oh, valiant Rama of Dasharatha, your valour is bruited as a sensational valour, and sensational is your smashing of Shiva's bow, also thus I have thoroughly heard about your others deeds like elimination of Tataka et cetera..."
Bala Kanda,75,2,"""That way, smashing of that particular bow of Shiva is wondrous and even unimaginable... on hearing that alone I happened upon you, bringing another outranking bow..."
Bala Kanda,75,3,"""This alone is that catastrophic bow received through Sage Jamadagni... flex it with an arrow on bowstring stretching up to your ear, and in that way show your capability..."
Bala Kanda,75,4,"""Thereby, on examining your strength in your taking aim with this bow, and should you be deservedly valorous, I will give you a combative duel..."" So said Parashu Rama to Dasharatha Rama."
Bala Kanda,75,5,"On hearing that sentence of Bhaargava Rama, then king Dasharatha became a pitiable one, and with a downcast face and adjoined palms said this."
Bala Kanda,75,6,"""Aren't you a Brahman with inviolable ascesis, and whose rancour on Kshatriya-s has calmed down long back. Why this hostility again. It'll be apt of you to award aegis to my sons, for they are yet youngsters..."
Bala Kanda,75,7,"""Aren't you from the bloodline of Bhaargava-s who always conduct themselves in self-study of Vedas and self-principled ways... haven't you readily discarded weapon-wielding on your promise to Thousand-eyed Indra..."
Bala Kanda,75,8,"""Such as you were, you on becoming a dedicatee to probity, haven't you given the planet earth to Kashyapa and haven't you repaired to forests, and haven't you flagged yourself on Mt. Mahendra..."
Bala Kanda,75,9,"""Or, oh, insurmountable sage, have you chanced upon us for a total annihilation of ours... when Rama is singularised and eliminated, nay-said that we all will be living..."" Thus Dasharatha had gone on appealing in his love for his sons."
Bala Kanda,75,10,While Dasharatha is speaking in that way that intransigent Bhaargava Rama of Sage Jamadagni uncaring for those merciful words of Dasharatha addressed Rama of Dasharatha alone.
Bala Kanda,75,11,"""These are the two strong and sturdy unsurpassed longbows, well-designed by gods and well-crafted by Vishvakarma, the Divine Architect, and these are very important among all bows and well-worshipped by all worlds... one broken in your, and the other in my hand..."
Bala Kanda,75,12,"""Oh, best one among men, out of the two longbows gods gave one to restive Trymbaka, God Shiva for a combat with demon Tripura, and oh, Kakutstha, that bow alone is the annihilator of Tripura, the demon... and you have broken that alone..."
Bala Kanda,75,13,"""This is the second one and the choicest gods gave this to Vishnu, thereby this is named after Him as 'Vishnu's bow...' this is an indestructible and enemy-citadel conquering longbow... and this is identical in its efficacy with Rudra's longbow... [1-75-13, 14a]"
Bala Kanda,75,14,"""Once, all the gods were asking the Grandparent, Brahma, as to who is powerful and who is less powerful among the blue-throated Shiva and Vishnu... but the Grandparent Brahma on inferring the intent of gods started to create adversity among those two, Shiva and Vishnu, for the Grandparent is the best adherer of truthfulness, as truth cannot be demonstrated on hearsay evidence... [1-75-14b, 15, 16a]"
Bala Kanda,75,16,"Legend: Brahma thought that it would better to enact a drama to cleanse the one-sided mentalities of these lesser gods. So, he started to write the script, and himself becoming the writer-director of that drama. That script is hereunder."
Bala Kanda,75,17,"Brahma: Mahadeva, who is the destroyer of Tripura, or say triple-citadels?"
Bala Kanda,75,18,"Shiva: Why? It is me, of course..."
Bala Kanda,75,19,"Brahma: Why do you boast that way of yourself? It is the long-arrow of your longbow, isn't it?"
Bala Kanda,75,20,Shiva: Yes of course...
Bala Kanda,75,21,Brahma: Then Vishnu was presiding deity of that long-bow... isn't t?
Bala Kanda,75,22,"Shiva: Yes, it is he, but I shot it from my bow... basically, is this a confusion, or, are you playing any part of Narada..."
Bala Kanda,75,23,"Brahma: Not so, the other day Vishnu was telling that he alone did that master task..."
Bala Kanda,75,24,"Shiva: How can it be! In the triple of doer-deed-instrument, instrument cannot become the doer... has his language gone topsy-turvy, noun is becoming verb and verb is lost to adjective and..."
Bala Kanda,75,25,"Brahma: Ok, Ok... we do not care much for grammar as we care more for communication, grammar is paNini's headache... but what he said is that he alone did it... not you..."
Bala Kanda,75,26,Shiva: Then why I am called... why that longbow is given to me... you should have got it done by Vishnu... why calling me... you have unnecessarily spoiled my dance program...
Bala Kanda,75,27,Brahma: Not that... I said what he said... let's not quarrel among ourselves...
Bala Kanda,75,28,"Shiva: I not only quarrel but wage war, if it comes to my interests and my devotees' interest... how many times I have not done so..."
Bala Kanda,75,29,"Brahma: That is what Vishnu was telling... every time you give a boon to every demon, and involve yourself in enmeshment, and Vishnu has come to come and rescue... have he forgotten the episode of bhasmaasura... thus Vishnu is saying and asking..."
Bala Kanda,75,30,Shiva: Now I don't tolerate... I will take him to task...
Bala Kanda,75,31,Exit Shiva - Enter Vishnu. Brahma reverses the above dialogue and says that to Vishnu
Bala Kanda,75,32,"Vishnu: No, No, highly objectionable... I will take him to task... I will take him to task..."
Bala Kanda,75,33,Exit All. War Started.
Bala Kanda,75,34,"""Owing to their animosity then occurred a fierce and hair-raising war among Shiva and Vishnu, as each aspired victory for himself... [1-75-16b, 17a]"
Bala Kanda,75,35,"""By the 'hum' sound of Vishnu that ruinously overpowering longbow of Shiva is broken, and the triple-eyed God, Mahadeva, is frozen... [1-75-17b, 18a]"
Bala Kanda,75,36,"""Then gods along with the assemblages of sages and celestial carana-s have come together and appealed to those two for appeasement in the matter of wielding authority, and then those two superior gods, Shiva and Vishnu, went into a state of amity... [1-75-18b, 19a]"
Bala Kanda,75,37,"""On seeing the bow of Shiva rendered inert by the mettlesomeness of Vishnu, from then on the gods along with the assemblages of sages deemed Vishnu to be the paramount... [1-75-19b, 20a]"

Mahendra practising ascesis and thus conjoined are the powers of ascesis in me... [1-75-24b, c, 25, 26a]"
Bala Kanda,75,43,"""On hearing about the breakage of Shiva's longbow, then I promptly came here.

Bala Kanda,75,27,"""Take an aim with an arrow that conquers enemy's citadels fixing it on this supramundane longbow... and oh, Kakutstha, should you be capable of it, thereafter I will give you a duel..."

Bala Kanda,76,2,"""Oh, Bhaargava Rama, whatsoever endeavour you have strived for freeing yourself from the indebtedness towards your father, I have heard of them, and oh, Brahman, we appreciate for your achieving that freeness from your paternal debt, but..."
Bala Kanda,76,3,"""Oh, Bhaargava Rama, demeaning me as though I am timorous, hence incapable to handle the bow, and hence I am an ignoble one for Kshatriya-hood, is meaningless... come on, now you may see my spiritedness and sprightliness..."" So said Rama to Bhaargava."
Bala Kanda,76,4,"Raghava, the nimble-handed vanquisher of his opponents, speaking thus in high dudgeon expropriated that estimable weapon, namely the longbow of Vishnu, from the hand of Bhaargava Rama, along with the long-arrow that is already fitted on it..."
Bala Kanda,76,5,"On lifting up the bow that is already fitted with an arrow on bowstring, then Rama started to take aim with it, but being indecisive about the target, then Rama of Dasharatha irefully said this to Rama of Jamagadni."
Bala Kanda,76,6,"""Oh, Rama of Bhaargava, even if you are a Brahman you are eliminable, but because of your relationship with Vishvamitra, and because you are a venerable one for me, I am disinclined to release this arrow that exterminates your life..."

Bala Kanda,76,11,"Then, when Rama is ready to take aim with the arrow on that inscrutable longbow, and when the worlds are being rendered as insentient, then that Rama of Jamadagni is rendered vigourless and he stared up at Rama of Dasharatha."
Bala Kanda,76,12,"Rama of Jamadagni is calloused as his vitality is subdued by the radiance of that lotus-petal eyed Rama of Dasharatha, and he spoke to Rama of Dasharatha, slowly and softly."

Bala Kanda,76,21,"While Rama of Jamadagni is speaking that way, that venturesome and blessed Rama of Dasharatha shot off that nonpareil arrow from that longbow of Vishnu."
Bala Kanda,76,22,"On seeing all of his realms of heavens are shot-blasted by Rama of Dasharatha, Rama of Jamadagni vanished in a trice to Mt. Mahendra, the heavenly mountain."
Bala Kanda,76,23,"Then dissipated is the darkness in all the divisions and likewise in all the subdivisions of compass, and the gods with the assemblages of sages extolled Rama, in whose hands the longbow is upraised."
Bala Kanda,76,24,"Then that dab hand at axe, Rama of Jamadagni, on acclaiming, and even on making circumambulations to Rama of Dasharatha, went on his own way into oblivion."
Bala Kanda,77,1,"On the departure of Rama of Jamadagni, that most glorious Rama of Dasharatha is quietened at heart, and he gave away that longbow of Vishnu into the hand of inimitable Rain-god."
Bala Kanda,77,2,"On paying respects to sage Vashishta and to the other important sages, Rama, the delight of Raghu's lineage, placatingly addressed his agitated father Dasharatha."
Bala Kanda,77,3,"""Rama of Jamadagni has gone on his way, you may now order the army under your wardship, for which you are the lord, to move on towards Ayodhya..."" So said Rama to his father."
Bala Kanda,77,4,"On hearing the words of Rama king Dasharatha hugged his son with both of his arms, and kissed on the forehead of Raghava, and king Dasharatha is gladdened to listen about the departure of Parashu Rama, and then he is further gladdened in deeming that he and his sons took a rebirth. [1-77-4, 5]"
Bala Kanda,77,5,"Then the King Dasharatha ordered that legion to move ahead, and then they all went towards delightful city Ayodhya, whose royal highways are wetted with water, sprinkled with bunches of flowers, decorated with banners and bannerettes up above them, and reverberating with high sounding bugle-horns. Further, those highways are replete with urbanites welcomers who are handling welcoming kits which are golden handy-crates or plates in which lit camphor, fragrant incenses, vermilion powder, flowers to shower on the incomers are arranged, and those highways are well-decorated with throngs of people who are glee-faced at their king's re-entry, and into such an exhilarating city Ayodhya king Dasharatha and his retinue entered. [1-77-7, 8a]"
Bala Kanda,77,6,"When the citizenry and city-dwelling Brahman-s have received him from a distance, that illustrious king Dasharatha followed by his phenomenal and praiseworthy sons then entered his happy house and home, which is like the lofty and lordly Himalayan palazzo. [1-77-8b, 9]"
Bala Kanda,77,10,"In palace king Dasharatha is overjoyed when he is surrounded with his own inmates of palace-chambers, and when his long cherished ambitions have come true, while his queens, Kausalya, Sumitra, and slender waisted Kaikeyi and other wives are overjoyed in the functions of receiving the four brides."
Bala Kanda,77,8,"Then the womenfolk of the king welcomed the highly propitious Seetha and the highly fortunate Urmila too, along with both the daughters of Kushadhvaja, namely Maandavi and Shrutakiirti, with pageantry and festivity. [1-77-11b, 12a]"
Bala Kanda,77,9,"All of the brides and bridegrooms clad in silks promptly worshipped the gods in sanctums to the benedictory chanting of Vedic hymns and Ritual-fires, thus they shone forth like the tongues of Holy Fires of Vedic Altars. [1-77-12b, 13a]"
Bala Kanda,77,10,"Then all the princesses paid respects to all of the respectable ones, and they luxuriated in sequestered palace-chambers along with their husbands. [1-77-13b, 14a]"
Bala Kanda,77,11,"And those best men among men, Rama, Lakshmana, Bharata, Shatrughna, who are by now accomplished persons in weaponry and whose marriages have also come to pass, occupied themselves in the welfare of kingdom while assisting their father and moving around with good hearted people.

Bala Kanda,77,12,"Then after sometime that king Dasharatha, the legatee of Raghu-s, spoke to his and Kaikeyi's son, Bharata. [1-77-15b, 16a]"
Bala Kanda,77,13,"""This is your maternal uncle and the son of king of Kekaya, and this valiant Yudhaajit came here to take you to Kekaya province, and he is staying behind because of your marriage..."" thus Dasharatha bade farewell to Bharata suggesting that Bharata may now go with Yudhaajit.

Bala Kanda,77,14,"On hearing the opinion of Dasharatha, Bharata, the son of Kaikeyi, then readied himself to travel along with Shatrughna to Kekaya province. [1-77-17b, 18a]"
Bala Kanda,77,15,"That valiant and best one among men Bharata on asking leave from his father, from Rama, an uncomplicatedly dextrous one in undertaking deeds, and even from his mothers, Kaikeyi, Sumitra, and Kausalya, travelled on along with Shatrughna. [1-77-18b, 19a]"
Bala Kanda,77,16,"Yudhaajit on clinching not only Bharata, but Shatrughna also, that valiant one is highly gladdened and entered his own city, indeed to the high rejoice of his father, King of Kekaya. [1-77-19b, 20a]"
Bala Kanda,77,17,"After the departure of Bharata, then the masterly proficient Rama along with Lakshmana started to square with the plans and programs of of his godly father for an ideal-sovereignty. [1-77-20b, 21a]"
Bala Kanda,77,18,"Rama keeping his father's directives in view undertook welfare activities for the people that are agreeable and even advantageous to them, and in the entirety of those activities, and he undertook activities to humour motherly affection with his mothers, and educational activities with educators, and in a highly self-disciplined manner he used to review them carefully from time to time. [1-77-22b, 22, 23a]"
Bala Kanda,77,19,"That way Dasharatha is pleased with the deportment and comportment of Rama, likewise the Brahman-s and urbanites, and even all of the indwellers in the entire kingdom are pleased, and he who has high distinction, his truthfulness alone is his vantage point, and whose hallmarks are of higher degree, that Rama has manifested himself to those subjects in the kingdom, and even to all of the living beings in the world, as the Self-Created Brahma. [1-77-23b, 24, 25a]"
Bala Kanda,77,20,"Also, that hearty Rama who permeated into the heart of Seetha is ensconced in Seetha's heart alone, and he disported for many seasons along with Seetha. [1-77-25b, 26a]"
Bala Kanda,77,21,"Seetha has become the beloved of Rama as she is wedded with the assent of his father Dasharatha, further Rama's love for Seetha burgeoned by virtue of Seetha's own virtues and loveliness. [1-77-26b, 27a]"
Bala Kanda,77,22,"Even Rama as her husband made his mark in Seetha's heart twice as good, and they both used to clearly converse about their thoughts in their heart of hearts, just by their hearts. [1-77-27b, 28a]"
Bala Kanda,77,23,"In her mien Seetha is identical with goddesses, and she is like personified Goddess Lakshmi, thus she is the reshaped Divine Prosperity, and as she hails from Holy Mithila she shall be held Holy, and since she is the daughter of Janaka, a loftiest sagacious and invincible king, she is sagely and stately, besides being shapely, and she with all these heaps of natural traits and characteristics, Seetha is rejoicing the heart of Rama. [1-77-28b, c]"
Bala Kanda,77,29,"When passionately conjugated with such a princess from the irreproachable king Janaka, Rama, the son of sagely king Dasharatha, has enthusiastically shone forth like the God of Gods and the Efficient Cause, namely Vishnu, when He is together with Goddess Lakshmi."

Ayodhya Kanda,1,17,"Rama was not interested in actions, which were not beneficial. He was a scholar. He had no taste in tales opposing righteousness. Like vï¿½chaspathi, his eloquent speech contained a series of strategies for action."
Ayodhya Kanda,1,18,Rama was a young man without any disease. He was a good speaker. He had a good body. He knew both time and place. He could grasp the essence of men. He was the one gentleman born on earth.

Ayodhya Kanda,1,26,"He identified good men and protected them. He knew the people worthy of reprimand. He knew the ways and means of getting income as well as the system of spending, as perceived by economic sciences."
Ayodhya Kanda,1,27,Rama could obtain great skill in the groups of sciences along with their subsidiaries. He was interested in enjoying comforts only after understanding the economic realities. He never remained inactive.
Ayodhya Kanda,1,28,Rama was acquainted with the fine arts useful for entertainment. He knew how to distribute the wealth. He was efficient in riding and taming of elephants and horses.
Ayodhya Kanda,1,29,Rama was the best of persons knowing the science of archery in the world; and was well appreciated by the champions of archery. He attained skills in marshalling the army. He faced and killed the enemies in battle.
Ayodhya Kanda,1,30,Even enraged celestials and demons could not defeat Rama in battle. He had no jealousy. He conquered anger. He had no arrogance and envy. He had not humiliated any living being. He had not surrendered to time.
Ayodhya Kanda,1,31,"That Prince Rama, with these good virtues, was fair to the people. He was agreeable to the three worlds. By patience and the related virtues, he was equal to earth, by wisdom to Brihaspathi and by valor to Devendra."
Ayodhya Kanda,1,32,"Rama, by his virtues, was a source of happiness to all the people and a spring of joy to his father. As the sun shines with his rays, Rama was shining, thus, with his virtues."
Ayodhya Kanda,1,33,The earth wished Rama to be her Lord as he was adorned with self -control and norms of behavior bearing undefeatable valor equal to that of universal lords like Indra.
Ayodhya Kanda,1,34,"Dasaratha, who annihilates enemies, started thinking as follows after observing his son with his many incomparable virtues."
Ayodhya Kanda,1,35,"The long living and aged Dasaratha thought: ""Will Rama become king while I am still alive? Shall I enjoy that happiness?"""
Ayodhya Kanda,1,36,A great loving thought was ringing in his mind that when he would be able to see his beloved son Rama crowned as a king.
Ayodhya Kanda,1,37,"""Is not Rama, as a raining cloud to the earth, better liked by people than me, as he desires the development of the world and has equal compassion towards all living beings."""
Ayodhya Kanda,1,38,"""Rama is equal to Yama and Devendra in valor, to Brihaspati in wisdom and to a mountain in courage. He is more virtuous than me."""
Ayodhya Kanda,1,39,"""Shall I attain heaven, after seeing in this age, my son ruling the entire earth?"""
Ayodhya Kanda,1,40,"Rama had many other virtues beyond hitherto stated virtues not to be seen in other kings. His virtues cannot be counted and they are the best in the world. Seeing that type of virtuous Rama, Dasaratha along with his ministers, decided to make Rama the prince."
Ayodhya Kanda,1,41,The wise Dasaratha said that there was sign of a great alarm being forecast because of comet like things found in earth heaven and the sky. He also told the ministers that his body was getting aged.
Ayodhya Kanda,1,42,"He recognized that if Rama were crowned as king, he would not have worries as Rama had beautiful face as a full moon; was a great wise man; and was liked by the people."
Ayodhya Kanda,1,43,The righteous Dasaratha was hurried with concern in the coronation of Rama as it is for his own benefit and for the benefit of people. Because it is as per his liking and also as the appropriate time has come.
Ayodhya Kanda,1,44,Dasaratha called for other kings and officers staying in various cities and villages in his kingdom separately.
Ayodhya Kanda,1,45,"The hurried Dasaratha did not call for the king Kekaya, the maternal uncle of Bharatha or the King Janaka as he thought they both could hear the good news even afterwards."
Ayodhya Kanda,1,46,"The king Dasaratha presented them suitably with houses and jewelry. Duly adorned himself, he looked after them in the manner Lord Brahma looks after his children."
Ayodhya Kanda,1,47,"All the invited kings, duly liked by their people, entered the assembly after the king Dasaratha , who annihilates the opponent's army, occupied his seat."
Ayodhya Kanda,1,48,"The kings thus entered, occupied their various seats allotted to them by the king, by facing toward the king as per the prescribed rules."
Ayodhya Kanda,1,49,"Surrounded by the respected and humble kings sitting closely to him as well as the important heads of cities and villages, king Dasaratha shone like lord Devendra surrounded by celestials."
Ayodhya Kanda,2,1,"Addressing invited gathering in the court, Dasaratha spoke in friendly, pleasing and clear terms."
Ayodhya Kanda,2,2,"In a loud voice resembling that of a kettle-drum, resounding the air like a thundering cloud and in a sweet splendid and incomparable voice endowed with the characteristics of a king's voice, King Dasaratha the lord of men spoke to the kings as follows:"
Ayodhya Kanda,2,3,"""It is well known that my excellent kingdom was ruled by my ancestral kings as if it were their son."""
Ayodhya Kanda,2,4,"""I have a desire that this entire land which was protected by the descendents of Ikshvaaku dynasty, be bestowed with goodness and the resultant happiness."""
Ayodhya Kanda,2,5,"""Following the path established by my ancestors, I have always protected my people with alertness and to the best of my ability."""
Ayodhya Kanda,2,6,"""In conducting the kingdom for benefit of the entire people, my body became impaired under shade of the white umbrella."""
Ayodhya Kanda,2,7,"""This body has been living for many thousands of years. Hence I desire rest."""
Ayodhya Kanda,2,8,"""This burden of worldly righteousness is very heavy. This can be sustained only by royal power with qualities like courage and valor. A person who has no control of senses can not carry this burden. I have become tired while carrying this burden of righteousness. """
Ayodhya Kanda,2,9,"""I desire to take rest, entrusting the rule to my son for the benefit of the people, after obtaining consent from all those best Brahmans who are close to me."""
Ayodhya Kanda,2,10,"""My eldest son Rama is equal to Devendra in valor. He is the conqueror of cities of enemies. He is equal to me in all qualities."""
Ayodhya Kanda,2,11,"""Joyfully, I shall appoint Rama, who shines like the moon together with Pushya star, who is the best among the protectors of righteousness and who is an excellent man, to the realm of prince."""
Ayodhya Kanda,2,12,"""If Rama becomes the lord, the three worlds also will have the best master. He is a glorious man. That Rama is the only fittest lord for the kingdom."""
Ayodhya Kanda,2,13,"""By entrusting this kingdom to Rama, I shall be thus doing an immediate good and shall be devoid of difficulties."""
Ayodhya Kanda,2,14,"""I am telling this after lot of thinking. Give consent to me if you feel this to be good and befitting. How else shall I do it?"""
Ayodhya Kanda,2,15,"""This is my desire. Yet, let there be thinking on any other beneficial way. Thinking by impartial neutral people will be distinctive and well developed through grinding of opposing views."""
Ayodhya Kanda,2,16,Those delighted kings complimented king Dasaratha so speaking with a loud applause as the peacocks cry in delight when they see the raining great cloud.
Ayodhya Kanda,2,17,That building appeared trembling by the sweet and reverberating sound made by the gathering of people there with their fond uproar.
Ayodhya Kanda,2,18,"After understanding the opinion of King Dasaratha, who knew the holy and worldly matters, the Brahmans, important people, urban and rural citizens came to a consensus after discussing together and told the aged king as follows."
Ayodhya Kanda,2,19,"""Oh king! You are an elderly person with thousands of years of age. Hence, inaugurate Rama as the ruling prince."""
Ayodhya Kanda,2,20,"""All of us want to see Rama, with long arms, the hero with great might born in the clan of Raghu , his face protected by a white umbrella, moving on a great elephant."""
Ayodhya Kanda,2,21,"King Dasaratha, after hearing their words, spoke as follows as though he did not know their mind earlier and sought to know their true intention."
Ayodhya Kanda,2,22,"""Oh kings, I have a doubt as to why you want Raghava to be the king immediately after hearing my words. Inform your real opinion in this matter."""
Ayodhya Kanda,2,23,"""Why do you desire to see my son as the prince, when I am ruling this earth with righteousness?"""
Ayodhya Kanda,2,24,"Those kings together with urban and rural citizens after hearing those words spoke to the great soul Dasaratha as follows: ""Oh king! Your son Rama has many auspicious virtues""."
Ayodhya Kanda,2,25,"""Oh king! We shall tell you now the various virtues of your wise son, listen to them. His qualities are equal to those of celestials. They are liked by all. They give happiness to all."""

Ayodhya Kanda,2,33,"""Rama was trained in all matters from the best of Brahmans skilled in the art of righteousness and in the science of political economy. If it is necessary to go to a battle to protect a village or a city, Rama goes with Lakshmana and returns home only after obtaining victory."""
Ayodhya Kanda,2,34,"""After returning from battle, Rama goes to citizens on an elephant or a chariot and inquires about their well being as though they were his own kinsmen, like a father does to his sons. He asks about their wives and children, about the sacred fires, about their servants and students, always completely as per the due order."""
Ayodhya Kanda,2,35,"""Rama the best among men always asks us 'Are your disciples serving you by keenly performing their actions?' """
Ayodhya Kanda,2,36,"""Rama feels very sad towards afflictions of men; and feels delighted in all functions celebrated by people on the occasions of child birth and the like, just as their own father does."""

Ayodhya Kanda,2,46,"""Both young and aged women are praying with a stable mind each morning and evening to all celestials, for the benefit of renowned Rama."""
Ayodhya Kanda,2,47,"""Oh best of kings, Dasaratha ! We shall see Rama adorned with princely kingdom. Your son Rama has the complexion of a black lotus flower and annihilates all his enemies. Let the wish of the people be fulfilled by your grace."""
Ayodhya Kanda,2,48,"""Oh fulfiller of people's desires, Dasaratha! For our benefit, you gladly and immediately inaugurate your son Rama, who is equal to Vishnu, who is interested in the welfare of the entire world and who is possessing the best of virtues."""
Ayodhya Kanda,3,1,"King Dasaratha, accepted their salutations with folded hands resembling lotus buds and spoke good and agreeable words to them as follows:-"
Ayodhya Kanda,3,2,"""Oh! I am very much pleased and incomparable is my fortune in that you desire my beloved elder son to be anointed as prince. """
Ayodhya Kanda,3,3,"King Dasaratha, thus duly returning the honor done by them, spoke while they were listening, to Vasishta, Vamadeva and other Brahmans as follows:"
Ayodhya Kanda,3,4,"""This is the glorious and auspicious month of Chaitra, in which the forests bloom with flowers. Let all arrangements be made for the coronation of Rama as prince."" While these words of the king were being completed, there was a great delightful uproar of the people."
Ayodhya Kanda,3,5,"When their applause gradually subsided, King Dasaratha spoke the following words to the best of sages, Vasishta."
Ayodhya Kanda,3,6,"""Oh Divine Vasishta! Be pleased to order now for the traditional ceremonial that is to be done and various accessories needed for the anointing ceremony of Rama."""

Ayodhya Kanda,3,16,"Those wise men Vasishta and Vamadeva attentively ordered for all those things to be done there, informed that to king Dasaratha and performed the remaining things also."
Ayodhya Kanda,3,17,Pleased and satisfied with the arrangements made Vasishta and Vamadeva approached king Dasaratha and told him that all had been done according to his words.
Ayodhya Kanda,3,18,"Afterwards, Dasaratha spoke to Sumantra ""Let Rama, who has a disciplined intellect, be brought by you immediately."""
Ayodhya Kanda,3,19,"As commanded by the king, Sumantra brought there, Rama, the best of charioteers, in a chariot."
Ayodhya Kanda,3,20,"Afterwards the kings belonging to east, west, north, south as well as those belonging to Mlechha kingdom, Aryaa Vartha kingdom and those ruling in hill and forest areas sat there and attended on King Dasaratha as celestials attended on Devendra."
Ayodhya Kanda,3,21,"The sage king Dasaratha, sitting in the midst of those kings like Devendra in the middle of the celestials, saw from the palace itself, his son Rama arriving in a chariot."
Ayodhya Kanda,3,22,"Rama was as beautiful as the king of Gandharvas. His valiance was world famous. He had great strength and walked like a vigorous elephant. He had long arms, and with his enchanting face, he looked like the moon. He stole the eyes and minds of the people by his looks, generosity and virtues. King Dasaratha was thus not satiated enough in seeing Rama, coming like a cloud that gladdens people by relieving them from the scorching summer heat."
Ayodhya Kanda,3,23,"Sumantra helped Rama to get down from the excellent chariot and with folded hands followed behind Rama, who approached his father."
Ayodhya Kanda,3,24,"Rama, the best among men, ascended the steps of the palace, which resembled Mount Kailaasa, along with Sumantra, to see the king Dasaratha."
Ayodhya Kanda,3,25,"Rama with folded hands approached his father, bowed down mentioning his own name and offered salutations to his father's feet."
Ayodhya Kanda,3,26,King Dasaratha took into his embrace that beloved son who was standing humbly beside him with folded hands.
Ayodhya Kanda,3,27,"King Dasaratha gave Rama a great throne, which was high, excellent and beautiful, decorated with gold and diamonds."
Ayodhya Kanda,3,28,"Rama, occupying that great throne, caused it to shine with his own brightness, just as the spotless sun in the morning causes Meru mountain to shine with brilliance."
Ayodhya Kanda,3,29,"Rama by his brilliance made that assembly to shine, just as the moon shines the clear autumnal sky, with the dimless stars and planets."
Ayodhya Kanda,3,30,"King Dasaratha was as delighted in seeing his beloved son, as one delights in seeing oneself adorned, in a mirror."
Ayodhya Kanda,3,31,"King Dasaratha, the best among those who have sons, smilingly conversed with his son, and addressed Rama as follows, as Kasyapa does to (his eldest son) Devendra (the ruler of gods)."
Ayodhya Kanda,3,32,"""Oh Rama! You are an exemplary son born to my exemplary elder wife. Being excellent in virtues, you are beloved son to me."""
Ayodhya Kanda,3,33,"""O, Rama! As you with your good qualities cherished these people, you get the princely kingdom on the day of Pushyami star (when the moon appears in conjunction with the constellation Pushya).."""

Ayodhya Kanda,3,35,"""Be even more humble and always keep the senses under control. Leave the bad habits born out of desire and wrath."""
Ayodhya Kanda,3,36,"""Through direct and indirect means, keep ministers and others happy."""
Ayodhya Kanda,3,37,"""Like the celestials becoming happy after obtaining the nectar, friends of a king (ruler of earth) are delighted when he fills the granaries and armories to the brim, making the common people delightful and happy. Hence, you too act like this."""
Ayodhya Kanda,3,38,"The well -wishers of Rama, after hearing those words, intending to do good to Kausalya, immediately came to her and informed the matter to her."
Ayodhya Kanda,3,39,"The best among women, Kausalya gave away gold, cows and different types of diamonds to those who informed her good news."
Ayodhya Kanda,3,40,"Rama, after offering salutations to king Dasaratha, ascended the chariot and went to his splendid house after being worshipped by the crowds on the way."
Ayodhya Kanda,3,41,"Having heard those words of the king, seeing their dearest wish gratified, the citizens took leave of the King Dasaratha and returned to their homes full of joy, in order to give thanks and render homage to the Gods."
Ayodhya Kanda,4,1,"After the citizens left, Dasaratha who was efficient in taking decisions pertaining to place and time of ceremonies, again conferred with the ministers and decided thus: ""Tomorrow will be a day when the constellation of Pushya would be in the ascendant. My son Rama, who has eyes like red lotus, can be crowned as a prince tomorrow""."
Ayodhya Kanda,4,2,"Thereafter, king Dasaratha entered the inner palace and then ordered Sumantra thus, ""Bring Rama again here""."
Ayodhya Kanda,4,3,"Obeying the king's words, Sumantra went to Rama's house immediately to bring Rama once again."
Ayodhya Kanda,4,4,"The doorkeepers informed Rama that Sumantra had come again. Hearing that, Rama was uncertain as to the reason for Sumantra's arrival again."
Ayodhya Kanda,4,5,"Rama immediately allowed Sumantra inside and spoke these words to him: ""Tell me completely the purpose of your arrival again."""

Ayodhya Kanda,4,7,"Rama, after hearing Sumantra's words, started immediately and went to the royal palace to see king Dasaratha, the Lord of people, again."
Ayodhya Kanda,4,8,"Hearing Rama to have arrived, king Dasaratha allowed him to come into the house, to tell him an excellent and affectionate word."
Ayodhya Kanda,4,9,"The glorious Rama, soon after entering his father's house, saw his father from a distance and fell prostrate before him in an act of submission, with his palms joined together."
Ayodhya Kanda,4,10,"Dasaratha lifted Rama up and took him into his embrace. Then, he offered a beautiful seat to Rama and spoke to him as follows:"
Ayodhya Kanda,4,11,"""Oh Rama, I have now become aged after living for a long period. I enjoyed all the luxuries in life, as I desired. I propitiated Gods by performing hundreds of sacrifices, in which food and lots of fees were given away to the officiating priests. """

Ayodhya Kanda,4,17,"""Oh, Rama! Astrologers are informing me that fearful planets like Sun, Mars and Rahu are encroaching my birth star."""
Ayodhya Kanda,4,18,"""Whenever such inauspicious signs are produced, the king generally will get either death or a fearful accident."""
Ayodhya Kanda,4,19,"""Oh, Rama! Hence, before my mind gets changed, get you anointed to the crown. Are not the minds of men unstable?"""
Ayodhya Kanda,4,20,"""Today, the moon is entering the constellation known as Punarvasu which comes before Pushyami star. The astrologers inform that the coronation ceremony can be fixed for tomorrow, when the moon joins Pushyami star."""
Ayodhya Kanda,4,21,"""Hence, get anointed for the crown on the day of Pushyami star. My mind is urging me as it were to expedite things. O, annihilator of the enemies! I shall anoint you for the princely kingdom tomorrow."""
Ayodhya Kanda,4,22,"""That is why, with self control, you along with your wife should observe fast for this night from now onwards, and sleep on a couch made of Kusha grass."""

Ayodhya Kanda,4,29,"There, in the queen's worshipping place, Rama saw Kausalya silently in meditation, wearing silk clothes and praying to goddess Lakshmi."
Ayodhya Kanda,4,30,"Hearing the good news of the coronation ceremony of Rama, Sumitra and Lakshmana came there even before Seetha was brought."
Ayodhya Kanda,4,31,"At that time, Kausalya closed her eyes and was in meditation. Along with her, Sumitra, Lakshmana and Seetha were sitting nearby."

Ayodhya Kanda,5,10,"Vasistha thus spoke to Rama and enjoined him to undertake a vow of fasting together with Seetha, in the accompaniment of mantras."
Ayodhya Kanda,5,11,"Thereafter, Rama worshipped the royal priest Vasistha suitably. Vasistha then got Rama's permission and left his house."
Ayodhya Kanda,5,12,Rama spent some time by delightedly talking with friends and having been congratulated by them in various ways went into his palace after taking leave of them.
Ayodhya Kanda,5,13,"Then, Rama's house was shining, as brilliantly with delighted men and women, as a lake filled with opened lotuses and visited by innumerable happy birds."
Ayodhya Kanda,5,14,"Vasishta, leaving Rama's house, which seemed like the royal palace, saw the way filled with people."
Ayodhya Kanda,5,15,All the royal highways in the city of Ayodhya were filled with groups and groups of delighted people and became congested.
Ayodhya Kanda,5,16,"Then, on the royal road, the resonance created by the rush of the people, moving hither and thither like waves, combined with their rejoicing, resounded like the roar of an ocean."
Ayodhya Kanda,5,17,"On that day, in the city of Ayodhya, all the roads were cleaned and sprinkled with water. There were rows of trees on both sides of the roads and flags hoisted on houses."
Ayodhya Kanda,5,18,"Then, the people of Ayodhya including children, women and the old-aged were waiting for sunrise, wishing the anointment ceremony of Rama to happen."
Ayodhya Kanda,5,19,"In Ayodhya, people were enthusiastic to see the great public function, which was decorative to the community and which would bring forward an increased joy."
Ayodhya Kanda,5,20,"Vasishta, thus seeing the king's way being overcrowded with people, reached the royal palace slowly by forcing a passage through that crowd."
Ayodhya Kanda,5,21,"He walked up the royal palace, which was akin to the top of a mountain enclosed by a white cloud and met king Dasaratha in the manner Brihaspati met Devendra."
Ayodhya Kanda,5,22,"Seeing Vasistha had returned, King Dasaratha alighted from his throne and asked him with regard to his mission. Vasistha informed him that it was accomplished."
Ayodhya Kanda,5,23,"The members of assembly who were sitting along with the king till then, raised in obeisance to Vasishta from their seats, following the example of the king."
Ayodhya Kanda,5,24,"King Dasaratha, after obtaining permission from Vasishta, left that assembly of men and entered his palace as a lion enters a mountain cave."
Ayodhya Kanda,5,25,"That palace with women in top dress and form was like the palace of Devendra. By the entering of King Dasaratha, the palace became more radiant, just as the moon radiates a beautiful sky with its stars."
Ayodhya Kanda,6,1,"After Vasistha left, Rama took bath and meditated on Lord Narayana with undistracted mind along with his wide-eyed wife, Seetha."
Ayodhya Kanda,6,2,"Taking the vessel with clarified butter on his head as per scriptures, he offered to Lord Vishnu the clarified butter, by dropping it into the blazing fire."
Ayodhya Kanda,6,3,"Rama ate the remainder of clarified butter after finishing the sacrifice, which he performed for his own good, silently meditated on Lord Narayana with controlled mind and slept along with Seetha on a properly laid bed of Kusa grass in a splendid temple of Lord Vishnu. *"
Ayodhya Kanda,6,4,Rama woke up three hours before dawn and caused to complete the entire decoration of the house.
Ayodhya Kanda,6,5,"Listening to the pleasing verses of professional reciters, he worshipped the early sunrise and meditated on Gayatri* with an undistracted mind."
Ayodhya Kanda,6,6,"He praised Lord Vishnu by bowing his head before Him. By wearing pure silk clothes, he got valedictory text recited by Brahmans."
Ayodhya Kanda,6,7,"Their deep and sweet chorus of the valedictory, united with the accompanying musical instruments, then filled the city of Ayodhya."
Ayodhya Kanda,6,8,All the people residing in Ayodhya were delighted when they heard that Rama and Seetha had observed fast for the ensuing anointment ceremony.
Ayodhya Kanda,6,9,"All the citizens decorated the town for coronation function of Rama, soon before sunrise."
Ayodhya Kanda,6,10,"Banners and colorful flags were hoisted on temples, which looked brilliantly like the silver lining of cloud, at road junctions, in streets, on big trees situated in temple compounds, from watching towers at city gates, on shops of wealthy merchants, on buildings of rich family persons, on all assembly halls and all visible trees."
Ayodhya Kanda,6,11,"From different sides, actors were showing their talents, dancers were performing dance. Singers were singing and sweet voices were heard, pleasing the minds and ears."
Ayodhya Kanda,6,12,"With Rama's anointment ceremony approaching, people were engaged in mutual conversations in their houses and at road junctions, about the ceremony."
Ayodhya Kanda,6,13,"Even children playing together before gateways of houses were telling each other, narratives of Rama's anointment ceremony."
Ayodhya Kanda,6,14,"The citizens made king's road splendid, by sprinkling flowers on it and by making it good smelling with burning of incense and perfumes, on the occasion of Rama's anointment ceremony."
Ayodhya Kanda,6,15,"On a doubt of approach of night on completion of the ceremony, they arranged lamps in the shape of trees to illuminate all the streets."
Ayodhya Kanda,6,16,"All the citizens residing in Ayodhya, having thus decorated the city desiring Rama's coronation, gathered together in groups at road junctions and in assembly halls, mutually talking about this matter there and praising king Dasaratha."
Ayodhya Kanda,6,17,"""O! This king Dasaratha, who delights Ikshvaaku dynasty, having known himself that he became aged, is going to anoint Rama for the kingdom. What a great man he is!"""
Ayodhya Kanda,6,18,"""Rama; who has seen the totality of the world is going to become our protector for long. We have all been blessed by king Dasaratha."""
Ayodhya Kanda,6,19,"""Rama is modest, knowledgeable and righteous. He is as compassionate to us as to his brothers."""
Ayodhya Kanda,6,20,"""Let the faultless and righteous king Dasaratha live long! Due to his blessings, we are going to see Rama as being anointed for the kingdom."""
Ayodhya Kanda,6,21,"The villagers, who came from different directions after hearing the news of coronation ceremony of Rama, listened to the narration of the citizens of Ayodhya."
Ayodhya Kanda,6,22,The city of Ayodhya was filled with villagers who came from different directions to see the anointment ceremony of Rama.
Ayodhya Kanda,6,23,"The noise in the city was heard by the groups of those people, while moving here and there, as the roaring of an impetuous ocean on full moon days."
Ayodhya Kanda,6,24,"That city of Ayodhya equal to the residence of the celestial god Indra, disturbed with the sound being made all over by the villagers who came with the desire to see the ceremony, shone like a roaring ocean filled with sea animals."
Ayodhya Kanda,7,1,"Manthara, a housemaid who was residing with Kaikeyi since her birth, accidentally ascended the balcony of Kaikeyi's white palace, which resembled the full moon."
Ayodhya Kanda,7,2,"Manthara, from that balcony, saw the entire city of Ayodhya, with all its principal roads being sprinkled with water and strewn with heaps of flowers."
Ayodhya Kanda,7,3,Manthara further saw from that balcony the city decorated with the best of flags and banners. The roads were cleared for uninterrupted traffic. All the people took head-bath. Brahmans with flowers and sweets in their hands were chanting Mantras. The gateways of temples were white washed. There were sounds of all musical instruments. The city was filled with rejoicing people and resounding chant of Vedas. The elephants and horses were also merry. The bulls were making roaring noise. The highly delighted citizens hoisted rows of flags on their housetops.
Ayodhya Kanda,7,4,"Manthara asked a house maid with bright pleasing eyes and wearing white silk clothes standing nearby, as follows: -"
Ayodhya Kanda,7,5,"""Why is Kausalya giving away money to people so delightfully today in charity, eventhough she is badly lured of money?"""
Ayodhya Kanda,7,6,"""Why are people so happy today? Is the king duly pleased with something, doing any great act? Tell me."""
Ayodhya Kanda,7,7,"That housemaid, bursting with joy, told Manthara in a great gladdening tone about the great honor to be conferred upon Rama."
Ayodhya Kanda,7,8,"""Tomorrow on the day of Pushyami star, king Dasaratha is going to anoint the fault-less Rama for the princely kingdom."""
Ayodhya Kanda,7,9,"After hearing the words of that maid, Manthara quickly with wrath walked down from the roof of the palace, which was in the shape of mount Kailasa."
Ayodhya Kanda,7,10,"Manthara of sinful thought; burning with anger, approached Kaikeyi who was lying on a bed and spoke these words:"
Ayodhya Kanda,7,11,"""O, fool! Get up. Why are you sleeping? A dreadful situation is befalling you. A flood of troubles submerges you. Why are you not knowing this yourself?"""
Ayodhya Kanda,7,12,"""Oh, Kaikeyi ! You appear to be a beloved wife for your husband, but in reality he does not like you. You boast of your fortune. Like the flow of a stream in summer; your fortune is unsteady""."
Ayodhya Kanda,7,13,Kaikeyi was very much worried after hearing hard words spoken with anger by Manthara of sinful thoughts.
Ayodhya Kanda,7,14,"Kaikeyi asked the hunch-backed Manthara as follows; ""O, Manthara! Are you not safe? You appear to be very sorrowful with your worried face""."
Ayodhya Kanda,7,15,"After hearing Kaikeyi's sweet words, Manthara who was an expert in talking, spoke with anger."
Ayodhya Kanda,7,16,"That Manthara, who was full of cunning, feigning to be seeking Kaikeyi's welfare, appeared more worried, and making Kaikeyi sorrowful, spoke the following, to create hostility between Rama and Kaikeyi."
Ayodhya Kanda,7,17,"""Oh, queen! An unending great ruin has encircled you. King Dasaratha is going to anoint Rama for the princely kingdom""."
Ayodhya Kanda,7,18,"""I am immersed in a bottomless pit of fear. I am in distress and my mind is burning as if by fire. I hastened here to seek you out."""
Ayodhya Kanda,7,19,"""Kaikeyi! If Rama becomes king, his son will become king after him. Thus, Bharata's name itself will be removed from the royal clan."""
Ayodhya Kanda,7,20,"""Oh, Kaikeyi! Having born in a royal family and being an emperor's wife, how is it that you are not knowing about the cruelty in kingly duties?"""
Ayodhya Kanda,7,21,"""Your husband talks about righteousness, but does harm secretly. He says sweet words but behaves cruelly. Because of your clean thinking; you are not able to know that he is cheating you thus."""
Ayodhya Kanda,7,22,"""Your husband approaches you and talks good words, which are useless. But he passes on benefit today to Kausalya only."""
Ayodhya Kanda,7,23,"""The evil minded Dasaratha sent Bharata to the house of his relatives and at dawn, is going to install Rama on the throne without hindrance."""
Ayodhya Kanda,7,24,"""O, childish one! Like a mother, you wish for his well being. But he is an enemy, and is called husband for a namesake. He is like a poisonous serpent in your bosom."""
Ayodhya Kanda,7,25,"""King Dasaratha has acted towards you and your son today in the same way as an enemy or a serpent would behave if ignored."""
Ayodhya Kanda,7,26,"""O, stupid one! With his untruthful sweet words to you, who are ever deserving of ease, the evil minded king is installing Rama on the throne and is thus ruining you along with your son."""
Ayodhya Kanda,7,27,"""O, Kaikeyi, of amazing beauty! You have to take timely action immediately, so as to save yourself, your son and me too."""
Ayodhya Kanda,7,28,"Hearing Manthara's words, that Kaikeyi of charming countenance who was lying in bed, rose from her coach full of delight like unto the crescent moon in autumn."
Ayodhya Kanda,7,29,That Kaikeyi in the midst of her astonishment and joy gave a graceful jewel to the hunch-backed Manthara.
Ayodhya Kanda,7,30,"Kaikeyi, the best among women, gave a jewel to Manthara and spoke to her as follows:"
Ayodhya Kanda,7,31,"""Oh, Manthara! You informed much gladdening news to me. What else can I do for you, who informed such a good news?"""
Ayodhya Kanda,7,32,"""I do not see any difference between Rama and Bharata. That is why, I am happy that Rama is being anointed for crown by the king."""
Ayodhya Kanda,7,33,"""O, Manthara! You do merit every favor. I have no other pleasant news than this. Hence, you cannot ever again inform a better loving news than this. I shall give you a good boon. Ask for it!"""
Ayodhya Kanda,8,1,"Manthara, becoming indignant with Kaikeyi, threw down the ornament given to her and with anger and distress spoke the following words:"
Ayodhya Kanda,8,2,"""O, foolish one! Not knowing that you are in the midst of an ocean of trouble, what is it that you are so delighted about, in a matter to be grieved?"""
Ayodhya Kanda,8,3,"""Oh, queen! Though stricken with grief, I mentally laugh at you in that you are rejoicing at the time when a great calamity is befalling you."""
Ayodhya Kanda,8,4,"""I am lamenting over your foolish mind. Does any intelligent woman feel happy over the prosperity of a stepson who is considered an enemy? Does it not amount to praising a befalling death?"""
Ayodhya Kanda,8,5,"""Rama has a fear about Bharata because Bharata has equal rights over the kingdom. In thinking about this matter, I am getting anguished. Do we not get disasters from those who are afraid of us?"""
Ayodhya Kanda,8,6,"""Lakshmana, wielding a great bow, joined Rama with all his heart. Shatrughna is as faithful to Bharata as Lakshmana to Rama""."
Ayodhya Kanda,8,7,"""Oh Kaikeyi! In line with even the proximity of birth; the claim to the throne of Bharata alone can be pressed, that of Lakshmana and Satrughna who are younger is out of question."""
Ayodhya Kanda,8,8,"""Rama is a learned man and a political statesman. His actions are timely and appropriate. When thinking of your son's calamity to be resulted from Rama, I get shaken with fear""."
Ayodhya Kanda,8,9,"""Kausalya is very fortunate. Brahmans are going to anoint her son for the great princely kingdom tomorrow on the day of Pushyami star""."
Ayodhya Kanda,8,10,"""With folded arms, as a maid-servant, you have to serve that Kausalya who having reached great prosperity, in the height of joy, will dispose of her adversaries (in the person of Bharata and yourself)""."
Ayodhya Kanda,8,11,"""Thus, if you become Kausalya's servant-maid along with us, your son Bharata will be Rama's attendant."""
Ayodhya Kanda,8,12,"""Rama's wives will get delighted. Your daughters-in-law will be unhappy because of Bharata's waning position."""
Ayodhya Kanda,8,13,"Hearing Manthara speak thus in many distasteful words, Kaikeyi began to extol Rama's virtues, saying: -"
Ayodhya Kanda,8,14,"""Rama knows all righteousness. Elders trained him. He has a proper gratitude. He speaks truth. He has a clean conduct. He is the eldest son of king Dasaratha and hence eligible for the kingdom."""
Ayodhya Kanda,8,15,"""The long living Rama will protect his brothers and servants like a father. O, the hunch backed one! Why are you so pained on hearing about Rama's coronation?"""
Ayodhya Kanda,8,16,"""After Rama's rule for one hundred years, Bharata the best among men will certainly replace Rama on his father's throne, which is that of his ancestors."""
Ayodhya Kanda,8,17,"""Oh, Manthara! When we got an occasion for rejoicing as at present and when a festive occasion is to come off in future (too in the form of Bharata's installation, no matter even if it comes after a hundred years), why do you feel agonized like this as though burning (with jealousy)?"""
Ayodhya Kanda,8,18,"""For me, Rama is as lovable as Bharata and even more. Is he not doing more service to me than to Kausalya?"""
Ayodhya Kanda,8,19,"""If Rama has kingdom then Bharata has it as well. Rama esteems his brothers just as his own self."""
Ayodhya Kanda,8,20,"Manthara, after hearing Kaikeyi's words, felt very sad and after a long and hot sigh, spoke to her the following words:"
Ayodhya Kanda,8,21,"""On one side, you are getting immersed in an ocean of sorrow filled with misery and danger. But due to stupidity, you are not able to perceive the truth and you fail to assess your real position."""
Ayodhya Kanda,8,22,"""O,Kaikeyi! If Rama becomes the king, his son will become the king after him in succession. Thus, Bharata's name itself will be removed from the royal clan."""
Ayodhya Kanda,8,23,"""O, Kaikeyi! All the sons of a king will not be crowned for a kingdom. If all are installed, there will be a great lawlessness."""
Ayodhya Kanda,8,24,"""Therefore, kings, O, Kaikeyi of faultless limbs, install their eldest son, eventhough others may be full of virtues, as their successor to the throne."""
Ayodhya Kanda,8,25,"""Oh, Kaikeyi the affectionate one! Your son will be completely distant from comforts and even from the royal clan; like an orphan."""
Ayodhya Kanda,8,26,"""I came here in your interests. But you have not understood me. You think it fit to give me a present when your step-wife is getting prospered."""
Ayodhya Kanda,8,27,"""Rama, ascending the throne without hindrance, will either send away Bharata to some other country or have him put to death. This is certain."""
Ayodhya Kanda,8,28,"""You sent Bharata to his maternal uncle's house even in his childhood. By being nearer, love is born even on inanimate objects. By sending Bharata to a distant place, you made Dasaratha to have no affection towards him."""
Ayodhya Kanda,8,29,"""Shatrughna was drawn towards Bharata and went along with him. Just as Lakshmana joined Rama, Shatrughna joined Bharata."""
Ayodhya Kanda,8,30,"""We hear that a tree marked down for felling by foresters, when covered by thorny Ishhiika grass, is saved from this great danger of cutting. So also, Dasaratha might have supported Bharata if he was staying near to him in Ayodhya."""
Ayodhya Kanda,8,31,"""Lakshmana protects Rama. Rama protects Lakshmana. Their brotherly love is as famous as that of Aswini celestials."""
Ayodhya Kanda,8,32,"""Hence, Rama will not do a sinful act of killing Lakshmana. However there is no doubt that he will do so in the case of Bharata."""
Ayodhya Kanda,8,33,"""Hence, I feel that it is better for your son to go to forest directly from his uncle's house. This is good for you too."""
Ayodhya Kanda,8,34,"""If Bharata gets his father's kingdom as per law, it will be beneficial to you and your side of relatives."""
Ayodhya Kanda,8,35,"""Your youthful son, habituated to comforts, is a natural enemy to Rama. How can Bharata who failed to achieve his purpose live under control of Rama; whose flourishing object has been realised?"""
Ayodhya Kanda,8,36,"""Rama is chasing and bringing down Bharata as a lion chases an elephant-king in forest. You ought to protect Bharata."""
Ayodhya Kanda,8,37,"""Previously, you treated Kausalya with disrespect due to arrogance that you were fortunate. Will not such Kausalya, your rival wife, revenge for that animosity?"""
Ayodhya Kanda,8,38,"""O, Kaikeyi! The day Rama becomes lord of this earth with its great oceans, mountains and towns; that day you and your Bharata will get a bad and pitiable position of ignominy."""
Ayodhya Kanda,8,39,"""When Rama gets power of the kingdom Bharata will certainly get ruined. Hence, think of a solution to get your son Bharata the kingdom and to send Rama, your enemy, to exile."""
Ayodhya Kanda,9,1,"After hearing those words, Kaikeyi with her face burning with anger, had a long and hot sigh and spoke to Manthara as follows:"
Ayodhya Kanda,9,2,"""Now itself, I shall send Rama quickly to forest. I shall get Bharata anointed for princely kingdom immediately."""
Ayodhya Kanda,9,3,"""O Manthara! What is the means by which Bharata will get the kingdom but Rama will not get it by any method. Think about it now."""
Ayodhya Kanda,9,4,"After hearing her words, the sinful thinking Manthara, spoke thus to Kaikeyi to destroy Rama's benefit of kingdom."
Ayodhya Kanda,9,5,"""O Kaikeyi! I am very glad. I shall tell you the means by which your son Bharata only will get the kingdom. Listen to it!"""
Ayodhya Kanda,9,6,"""Oh, Kaikeyi! You desire to hear from me the means for your benefit. Have you forgotten about it or are you hiding, even if you have remembered it?"""
Ayodhya Kanda,9,7,"""O the lady of charms, Kaikeyi! If you desire to hear this from my mouth, I shall tell you. Listen to me. Let it be acted upon after listening to me."""
Ayodhya Kanda,9,8,"After hearing Manthara's words, Kaikeyi slightly rose from the well-laid bed and spoke the following :"
Ayodhya Kanda,9,9,"""O Manthara! Tell me the trick by which Bharata will get the kingdom and Rama will not get it under any circumstances."""
Ayodhya Kanda,9,10,"After hearing Kaikeyi's words, the sinful thinking, hunch backed Manthara, spoke thus, with an intention to destroy Rama's benefit of kingdom."
Ayodhya Kanda,9,11,"""O Queen! Once upon a time, when there was a battle between celestials and demons, your husband Dasaratha went along with you and other holy kings to help Indra in battle, to a famous city called Vaijayata in which the demon Timidhvaja lived in a southern direction in the forest of Dandaka."""
Ayodhya Kanda,9,12,"""That great demon famously called shambara, who had several magic effects, defeated all the celestials and conferred battle upon Devendra."""
Ayodhya Kanda,9,13,"""In that great battle, demons approached and forcefully killed men who were injured by arrows and also those who were sleeping at night."""
Ayodhya Kanda,9,14,"""Then, king Dasaratha fought a great battle there. With their weapons, demons made into pieces the long armed Dasaratha."""
Ayodhya Kanda,9,15,"""O Queen! You saved the life of your unconscious husband by taking him away from the battle field. There also, you again saved him, when beaten by demons with their weapons."""
Ayodhya Kanda,9,16,"""O Kaikeyi with auspicious appearance! Getting delighted, he gave two boons to you. Then, you said, "" I shall ask you whenever I require them"". He then agreed to it."""
Ayodhya Kanda,9,17,"""O Queen! I do not know what had happened there. You yourself told this story previously to me. I am keeping this in my mind because of my friendship with you. Hence, you have to stop, by force, the arrangements being made for Rama's coronation."""
Ayodhya Kanda,9,18,"""You ask your husband as two boons, anointing Bharata for princely kingdom and sending Rama to exile for fourteen years."""
Ayodhya Kanda,9,19,"If you send Rama to forest for fourteen years, your son Bharata will get intimate association in the hearts of the people and will get stabilised in kingdom."
Ayodhya Kanda,9,20,"Oh, kaikeyi! Now, enter the room of wrath as if angry with him and lie down on floor without any spread underneath and wearing soiled clothes."
Ayodhya Kanda,9,21,"As soon as you see Dasaratha, be sorrowful and keep on weeping, without looking at him and without talking to him face to face."
Ayodhya Kanda,9,22,You are always dear to your husband. I have no doubt about it. King Dasaratha will even jump into a fire for your sake.
Ayodhya Kanda,9,23,The king is not capable of making you angry. He is not even able to see you with anger. He will give up his life for your love.
Ayodhya Kanda,9,24,"Oh, foolish one! The king will not be able to transgress your word. You realise your abundant strength."
Ayodhya Kanda,9,25,"King Dasaratha may offer you diamonds, pearls, gold and various other precious stones. Do not care for them."
Ayodhya Kanda,9,26,"Oh, Kaikeyi, the great fortunate! you remind Dasaratha of those boons given by him to you in that battle between celestials and demons. See that your benefit does not get thwarted."
Ayodhya Kanda,9,27,"Dasaratha himself will raise you from the floor and offer you the boon. Thus , after making him steady, you ask for this boon."
Ayodhya Kanda,9,28,"""Oh, king! send Rama to forest for fourteen years. Let Bharata be made as king of this earth""."
Ayodhya Kanda,9,29,"Rama having been sent to forest for fourteen years, your son will stand firmly, having laid his roots and will stay in power for the remaining period."
Ayodhya Kanda,9,30,"Oh, Kaikeyi! Ask Dasaratha of sending Rama to forest also as a boon. Thus, your son will accomplish all the desired benefits."
Ayodhya Kanda,9,31,"Thus , by sending Rama to exile, he will not become amiable to people. Your Bharata will become king, after the enemies having been annihilated."
Ayodhya Kanda,9,32,"When Rama returns from forest, your wise son will accumulate friends and draw people to his fold, thus establishing roots himself."
Ayodhya Kanda,9,33,"This is the appropriate time for you. Be fearless and by your insistence, make the king turn aside his effort to anoint Rama."
Ayodhya Kanda,9,34,"Kaikeyi, being brain-washed an unworthy matter as the most worthy matter by Manthara, accepted her well and having delighted, spoke to her as follows:-"
Ayodhya Kanda,9,35,"Though of right thinking in nature, Kaikeyi was very much surprised to hear Manthara's words and like a small girl, got into a wrong path."
Ayodhya Kanda,9,36,"Oh, Manthara! You are telling very good things. Till now, I have not recognised you as this good. You are the best among the hunch-backed on this earth in making intellectual decisions."
Ayodhya Kanda,9,37,"Oh, Manthara! you always show interest in my well being and wish for my benefit. But for you, I would not have been aware of the king's intentions."
Ayodhya Kanda,9,38,"There are so many hunch backed persons in the world. Their bodily construction is very bad. They are crooked and dreadful. But you appear lovely, as a lotus flower bent by breeze."
Ayodhya Kanda,9,39,"Your chest is appearing equally on both sides and is loftily extended unto the shoulder. Below it is the stomach with an excellent navel, which is lean as though it is shy of seeing the loftiness of chest."
Ayodhya Kanda,9,40,"Oh, Manthara! with perfect hips and well rounded breasts and with your face like an untainted moon you are shining well."
Ayodhya Kanda,9,41,"Oh, Manthara! your waist decorated with golden belt is making sound. Your leg-muscles are well rounded and your feet are tall."
Ayodhya Kanda,9,42,"Oh, Manthara! you are splendid like a royal swan walking before me, with long thighs are wearing a silk sari."
Ayodhya Kanda,9,43,"In addition to all those thousand magic effects lying in shambara, the lord of demons, another further thousands of magic effects are lying in you."
Ayodhya Kanda,9,44,"In your long hunch, which looks like an apex of a chariot, are dwelling your various thoughts, royal arts and magic effects."
Ayodhya Kanda,9,45,"Oh Manthara! When Rama goes to forest and Bharata gets kingdom, I shall adore this hunch back with a golden garland."
Ayodhya Kanda,9,46,"Oh, Manthara! After accomplishing the benefit desired by me, I shall, with delight, get your hunch back anointed with well refined gold of good quality."
Ayodhya Kanda,9,47,"Oh, Manthara! I shall get beautiful ornaments made and for your forehead auspicious dots of variety done of pure gold."
Ayodhya Kanda,9,48,"You will be moving around like an angel, wearing beautiful clothes. You will achieve an important position in the eyes of your adversaries with pride and with your face, incomparably competing with moon."
Ayodhya Kanda,9,49,"The hunch backed women, adorned with all ornaments, will always do service, at your feet, as how as hunch-backed women, adorned with all ornaments, will always do service at your feet, as how as hunch-backed you are doing it to me."
Ayodhya Kanda,9,50,"Manthara in this way being praised spoke these words to Kaikeyi, who was lying in a clean couch like a flame of fire upon the sacrificial altar."
Ayodhya Kanda,9,51,"Oh, Kaikeyi the auspicious one! When water has already flown out, there is no use constructing a dam. Now rise and do this purposeful action. Show your influence to the king."
Ayodhya Kanda,9,52,"By surrendering to the words of Manthara and having been thus encouraged by her, Kaikeyi who was of wide eyes, who was proud of her intoxicating beauty, who was a gifted woman and a queen, removed pearl necklace worth in lacs and other great valuable auspicious ornaments from her body, entered the chamber of wrath along with Manthara, lied on the floor there like a golden wire and spoke to Manthara as follows:"
Ayodhya Kanda,9,53,"""After Rama's going to the forest, Bharata shall get the kingdom. Or else, you inform the king that I died here itself""."
Ayodhya Kanda,9,54,"Neither gold nor diamonds nor ornaments are of any use to me. on which day Rama gets anointed for the kingdom, the same day it will be the end of my life."
Ayodhya Kanda,9,55,"Afterwards, that Manthara again spoke to the seriously talking mother of Bharata that is Kaikeyi the following words which were beneficial to her and not beneficial in relation to Rama."
Ayodhya Kanda,9,56,"If Rama becomes king, you and your son will be destroyed. Oh, Kaikeyi of auspicious qualities! Hence you try for coronation of your son, Bharata"
Ayodhya Kanda,9,57,"Having thus hit by arrows of words employed by Manthara again and again, Kaikeyi felt sad, was angry with the king, by keeping hands on her heart, was surprised with the cleverness of Manthara and praised her time and again."
Ayodhya Kanda,9,58,"If Rama does not go to forest from here, I do not long for any mattresses or garlands or sandal paste or eye-liner or drink or food or even the loaf here."
Ayodhya Kanda,9,59,"If Rama does not go to forest from here, I do not long for any mattresses or garlands or sandal paste or eye-liner or drink or food or even the life here."

Short and hunch-backed maid-servants were moving here and there. There were bowers surrounded with creepers and lovely champaka and Ashoka trees. There were painted rooms. There were altars built with ivory, silver and gold. There were trees yielding flowers and fruits in all seasons and wells in the middle. There were beautiful seats constructed with ivory, silver and gold. Various types of food, drinks and snacks were made available. That palace was looking like heaven with beautifully adorned women."

Ayodhya Kanda,49,13,"""When, coming back and united with my mother and father, shall I roam hunting in the forest, bordering on Sarayu river and laden with blossoms?"""
Ayodhya Kanda,49,14,"""I do not hanker much after hunting in the woodlands bordering on Sarayu river. In fact it is a delightful spot, made much of in the world by hosts of royal sages. Hunting in the forest is indeed for gratification of royal sages in this world. At times; the bow- men adopted it. But I do not long for it excessively."""
Ayodhya Kanda,49,15,"Uttering in sweet voice to the charioteer on various topics dearer to him, Rama advanced thus along that route."
Ayodhya Kanda,50,1,"Having traveled the extensive and beautiful Kosala territory and standing with his face turned towards Ayodhya, the wise Rama with joined palms spoke the following words:"
Ayodhya Kanda,50,2,"""I bid farewell to you, Oh best of the cities, carefully protected by Dasaratha born in Kakutstha dynasty, as well as of the deities who protect you and dwell in you."""
Ayodhya Kanda,50,3,"""After getting relieved from exile in the forest and thus freed from the debt to the emperor, I shall see you again, duly getting united with my mother and father."""
Ayodhya Kanda,50,4,"Lifting his right arm and wearing a woeful look, his face covered with tears, Rama possessing lovely reddish eyes, spoke them to the people hailing from the countryside.(as follows) :"
Ayodhya Kanda,50,5,"""Mercy and compassion according to my worth (in your view) have been shown to me by you. Keeping agony for a long time is undesirable. Let each return to accomplish your desired object(attending to your house-hold work)!"""
Ayodhya Kanda,50,6,"Respectfully saluting the high soled prince and going round him clockwise (as a mark of reverence), those men stood rooted here and there, wailing frightfully."
Ayodhya Kanda,50,7,"While they were lamenting thus unceasingly, Rama passed beyond their sight, as the sun sinks out of view at nightfall."
Ayodhya Kanda,50,8,"Then Rama, a tiger among men, in his chariot, crossed Kosala territory, which was rich in grain and treasure, inhabited by men given to charity, benevolent and free from every danger, pleasing, full of temples and sacrificial stakes, adorned with gardens and mango-orchards, intersected by ponds full of water, populated by contented and well nourished people, abounded in herds of cows which deserved to be seen by all kings and which re-echoed to the chanting of religious texts."
Ayodhya Kanda,50,9,"Rama, the best among the resolute, moved into the middle of a happy and prosperous kingdom, abounding in lovely gardens and fit to be enjoyed by kings."
Ayodhya Kanda,50,10,"There, Rama beheld the celestial and lovely river of Ganga with its tree tributaries, carrying clear waters without green moss and frequented by sages."
Ayodhya Kanda,50,11,"The River Ganga was adorned with splendid hermitages within easy distance from one another, with pools overflowing with water, visited at suitable hours by celestial nymphs thrilling with rapture."
Ayodhya Kanda,50,12,"The blessed river was graced by gods and demons, Gandharvas(celestial musicians) and kinnaras and was constantly visited by consorts of Nagas and Gandharvas."
Ayodhya Kanda,50,13,"The well known river was hemmed in by hills serving as the play- ground of hundreds of celestials and embellished with hundreds of celestial gardens; it coursed through the heavens for the benefit of gods and which in heaven was named ""The stream of Golden Lotuses""."
Ayodhya Kanda,50,14,"The holy river, the sound of whose clashing waves and its striking with rocks resembled a deep laughter, having a bright smile as white as a foam, its waters reduced at some places to the shape of a maiden's plaited locks, was rendered beautiful at some places by whirl pools."
Ayodhya Kanda,50,15,"At some places, its waters were still and deep. At some places, they were disturbed with violent agitation. At some places, they made a deep roaring sound. At some places, they were having a terrific noise"
Ayodhya Kanda,50,16,"Hosts of gods took a dip into its water .It was adorned by white lotuses. It was hemmed in, with expanse of small islands and at some places, lined with white sands."
Ayodhya Kanda,50,17,"The river was rendered resonant by swans and cranes, was graced with cackling of Chakrawaka** birds and other birds which are in rut all through the year kept hovering on its water."
Ayodhya Kanda,50,18,"At some places the river was adorned with trees growing on its banks encircling like garlands, at some places crowded with thick cluster of lotuses."
Ayodhya Kanda,50,19,"At some places, it was graced with beds of water lilies in the form of buds and at some places, it was reddened with the pollen of numerous flowers, as though excited with passion."
Ayodhya Kanda,50,20,"Having every aggregation of dirt removed, the river presented a spotlessly clear appearance like a crystal. The interior of the forest was reddened noisy again and again by the elephants guarding the quarters, by the ruttiest wild elephants and the elephants of excellent breed used for riding by gods."
Ayodhya Kanda,50,21,"Surrounded by fruits and flowers and tender leaves, shrubs and birds, it looked like a young woman artistically decked with the best of jewels. The river was infested with dolphins, crocodiles and snakes."
Ayodhya Kanda,50,22,"Rama, the mighty armed, reached the river Ganga, which is devoid of sins and which dispels all sins, which had fallen from the mass of matted hair of Lord Shankara through the spiritual power of Emperor Bhagiratha, which is rendered noisy by cranes and herons, which is a consort of the ocean and which is in the vicinity of Sringaverapura(the modern Singraur)."
Ayodhya Kanda,50,23,"Beholding the river Ganga with its waves covering whirlpools, Rama the great warrior said to Sumantra the charioteer as follows: ""We shall halt here itself today."""
Ayodhya Kanda,50,24,"""Oh, charioteer! Not far from the river stands this very large sacred fig tree with its many flowers and shoots. We shall stay here itself."""
Ayodhya Kanda,50,25,"""I shall see (from here) the excellent river Ganga, which is auspicious and whose waters deserve to be respected by gods, men, Gandharvas, beasts, reptiles and birds ."""
Ayodhya Kanda,50,26,"Saying ï¿½so be it' and nothing more to Rama, Lakshmana and Sumantra too then directed the horses to that sacred fig tree."
Ayodhya Kanda,50,27,"Rama, the delight of Ikshvaku dynasty, reached that beautiful tree and got down from the chariot along with Sita and Lakshmana."
Ayodhya Kanda,50,28,"Sumantra too dismounted from the chariot, unyoked the superb horses after which with joined palms, he seated himself near Rama at the foot of the tree."
Ayodhya Kanda,50,29,"There, a king named Guha was Rama's friend dear to him as his own life. He was Nishada by birth, a strong man and well known as a ruler of Nishadas."
Ayodhya Kanda,50,30,"Hearing of Rama the tiger among men having come to his territory, he approached the prince, escorted by elderly ministers and relatives."
Ayodhya Kanda,50,31,"Seeing from a distance the king of Nishada coming, Rama along with Lakshmana thereupon went forth to meet Guha."
Ayodhya Kanda,50,32,"Closely embracing Rama, Guha who felt disturbed, spoke to him, ""This city too is as much as Ayodhya to you. What can I do for you? Oh mighty armed! Who indeed will get such a lovely guest?"""
Ayodhya Kanda,50,33,"Having brought pristine cooked rice of excellent quality and other dishes of various kinds, he then quickly offered him water to wash his hands and spoke as follows:"
Ayodhya Kanda,50,34,"""Welcome to you, Oh, mighty armed! All this land is yours. We are your servants. You are the Lord. Rule over our kingdom in an efficient way."""
Ayodhya Kanda,50,35,"""Here have arrived various kinds of dishes, drinks and syrups as also excellent beds (for you to sleep on) and food for your horses"""
Ayodhya Kanda,50,36,"To Guha who was speaking as aforesaid, Rama replied thus: ""We stand honored by you, by your very visit to us on foot, as well as your show of affection and are pleased with you"""
Ayodhya Kanda,50,37,"Pressing gently with his muscular arms, Rama spoke these words: "" Oh, Guha! Thank heaven that I am seeing you in good health with your relatives. Is all well with the kingdom, the allies and the treasure?"""
Ayodhya Kanda,50,38,"""I know your affection by which all this is extensively well arranged by you. But I am not in a position indeed to accept it."""
Ayodhya Kanda,50,39,"""Know me as under a vow to be an ascetic, wearing the robes of bark and deerskin and by piety, I am determined to live in the forest by eating roots and fruits only."""
Ayodhya Kanda,50,40,"""I desire nothing but a little forage for the horses. By being provided with this much at the present moment, I shall be duly satisfied by you."""
Ayodhya Kanda,50,41,"""These horses were cherished by the king Dasaratha, my father. I shall feel honored by these horses being duly fed."""
Ayodhya Kanda,50,42,"Then Guha on that spot commanded his men as follows: ""Let water for drinking and forage be supplied promptly to horses"""
Ayodhya Kanda,50,43,"Having worshipped the evening twilight appearing in the west, with an upper garment made of bark(on his person); Rama then took for food only water brought by Lakshmana himself."
Ayodhya Kanda,50,44,"Having washed the feet of Rama who was lying on the ground along with his consort, Lakshmana then came and stood near a tree."
Ayodhya Kanda,50,45,Guha too along with the charioteer conversed with Lakshmana and thereafter wielding a bow; alertly kept a vigil over Rama.
Ayodhya Kanda,50,46,"The illustrious, lofty minded and the high-soled son of Dasaratha, who had never seen suffering and who deserved all comforts, remained lying on the ground thereafter, while that long night passed away."
Ayodhya Kanda,51,1,"Distressed with anguish (to see Rama and Sita lying on the ground) Guha said to Lakshmana, the scion of Raghu, who kept awake, through sincere love, for the protection of his brother Rama."
Ayodhya Kanda,51,2,"""Here is a comfortable bed made for you, my friend! Relax well comfortably on it, Oh, prince!"""
Ayodhya Kanda,51,3,"""All of us are habituated to hardships. You are habituated to comforts. We shall keep awake this night, for the protection of Rama"""
Ayodhya Kanda,51,4,"""For, none is dearer to me than Rama in this world. I speak the truth and swear to you by truth."""
Ayodhya Kanda,51,5,"""I hope to acquire abundant acclaim and supreme merit in this world as also full reward of wealth, by the sole grace of Rama"""
Ayodhya Kanda,51,6,"""As such, I along with my kindred, shall protect my dear friend Rama who is reposing with Sita in every way, with bow in hand."""
Ayodhya Kanda,51,7,"""Nothing is indeed unknown in this forest to me, where I wander continually. We can able to withstand even a vast army too, comprising of four parts (elephants, chariots, cavalry, and infantry)."""
Ayodhya Kanda,51,8,"Then, Lakshmana replied to Guha as follows: ""Oh, sinless Guha! Being protected by you, who keep your duty alone in view, all of us are fearless in this land."""
Ayodhya Kanda,51,9,"""When Rama, the son of Dasaratha is lying on the ground with Sita, how is it possible for me to sleep or to enjoy the pleasures of life?"""
Ayodhya Kanda,51,10,"""See that Rama, who cannot be vanquished in combat even by the gods and demons combined, now sleeping profoundly on the grass along with Sita."""
Ayodhya Kanda,51,11,"When Rama- who is endowed with similar characteristics as Dasaratha, uniquely beloved, the son obtained by Dasaratha by virtue of his chanting of several sacred texts and austerities and by various undertakings (in the form of sacrificial performances) has gone to exile, the king will not live long and the earth will become surely widowed forthwith."
Ayodhya Kanda,51,12,"Having cried out in a high-pitched tone, the women having exhausted, will have fallen silent and I am sure that a profound stillness reigns in the palace."
Ayodhya Kanda,51,13,"""I do not expect Kausalya, Dasaratha and my mother all of them to remain alive for this night."""
Ayodhya Kanda,51,14,"""By looking forward to meet Satrughna, my mother might even stay alive. But it will be painful if Kausalya who has given birth to a heroic son, dies."""
Ayodhya Kanda,51,15,"That city of Ayodhya, filled with devoted people, hitherto a source of joy and which brought pleasure to the world, when seized with agony over the king's death, will perish."
Ayodhya Kanda,51,16,"""How, in the absence of his magnanimous and the first born son, will the vital airs in the body of the generous king be maintained?"""
Ayodhya Kanda,51,17,"""After the death of king, Kausalya will die. My mother also will die thereafter."
Ayodhya Kanda,51,18,"""Having failed to install Rama in the kingdom, failed forever, which was the most cherished wish of his heart, my father will leave this world."
Ayodhya Kanda,51,19,"""Those who are fortunate will consecrate our deceased father and the king in the course of all funeral rites, when the hour has struck."
Ayodhya Kanda,51,20,"People will joyfully move in the capital belonging to my father and the city with its quadrangular places allocated at lovely sites, and well- aligned roads, rich in mansions of well-to-do men, temples and royal palaces adorned with the foremost of courtesans, its chariots horses and elephants that obstruct the roads, the musical instruments that resound there- full of all blessings and crowded with merry and well fed men, well- provided with gardens and royal parks and bright with festivities carried on under the patronage of associations."
Ayodhya Kanda,51,21,"Will Dasaratha remain alive? After returning from exile, can we see the high-soled king Dasaratha of noble vows again?"
Ayodhya Kanda,51,22,"Can we safely return to Ayodhya, after completion of the exile in the forest along with Rama who is faithful to his promises?"
Ayodhya Kanda,51,23,"While the high-soled Lakshmana thus lamenting, stood on ground, afflicted with anguish as he was, that night rolled away."
Ayodhya Kanda,51,24,"While Lakshmana (son of Dasaratha), who was concerned with the welfare of the people; was thus speaking the truth out of his affection for his elder brother (Rama), Guha, overcome with agony and oppressed with adversity shed tears like an elephant tormented with fever."
Ayodhya Kanda,52,1,"That night having given way to dawn, the illustrious Rama with a broad chest spoke (as follows) to Lakshmana, the son of Sumitra and who was endowed with auspicious signs :"
Ayodhya Kanda,52,2,"""Oh, dear brother! This is the hour of sunrise. The auspicious night has departed. That bird of dark plumage, the cuckoo, is singing."""
Ayodhya Kanda,52,3,"""Oh, good brother! Hear the cries of peacocks resounding in the forest. Let us cross the swift-flowing Ganga River that gushes to the sea."""
Ayodhya Kanda,52,4,"Lakshmana, the delight of his friends, having understood the words of Rama, called Guha as well as Sumantra and stood in front of his brother."
Ayodhya Kanda,52,5,"Hearing the command of Rama, Guha quickly received it, invited his ministers and spoke to them as follows:"
Ayodhya Kanda,52,6,"""Let a beautiful boat that is solidly constructed, sails well and a helmsman in it, be brought to the bank to carry this hero across!"""
Ayodhya Kanda,52,7,"Hearing that command, the chief minister of King Guha brought a charming boat to the bank and reported the matter to Guha."
Ayodhya Kanda,52,8,"Then, Guha with folded hands spoke to Rama as follows: ""Oh, Lord! Here, the boat has arrived. What more can I do for you?"""
Ayodhya Kanda,52,9,"""Oh, tiger among men! Oh, Rama resembling a son of divinity! Here is the boat for you to cross the river, which flows into the sea. Oh, virtuous one! (Pray) get into it."""
Ayodhya Kanda,52,10,"Then, Rama with great splendor, spoke to Guha as follows: ""My desire has been accomplished by you. Let us embark with all speed."""
Ayodhya Kanda,52,11,"Having equipped themselves with a quiver each with arrows, fastening their swords and armed with their bows, Rama and Lakshmana, with Sita, proceeded towards the river of Ganga."
Ayodhya Kanda,52,12,"Sumantra joining his palms in humility, approached Rama who knew what is right and said, ""What shall I do?"""
Ayodhya Kanda,52,13,"Touching Sumantra with his auspicious right hand, Rama then said: ""Oh, Sumantra! Return quickly to the king's presence and be attentive in serving him."""
Ayodhya Kanda,52,14,"""Go now, that your service to me has been completed. Abandoning the chariot, I shall go on foot to the mighty forest,"" Rama said."
Ayodhya Kanda,52,15,"Finding himself dismissed, Sumantra the charioteer was distressed and spoke to Rama, the tiger among men, as follows:"
Ayodhya Kanda,52,16,"""None in the world has had to suffer such a fate as yourself; that you should have to dwell in the forest with your brother and your consort as if you were an ordinary man!"""
Ayodhya Kanda,52,17,"""I think that there is no reward in leading a life of religious student or in studying religious scriptures or even in cultivating tenderness and straight forwardness, when adversity has come to you."""
Ayodhya Kanda,52,18,"""Oh, heroic Rama! Living in the forest along with Sita and your brother, you will obtain the same position as one who has conquered the three worlds."""
Ayodhya Kanda,52,19,"""Oh, Rama! We are actually ruined, in that, disappointed in our hopes by you too, we shall fall under the sway of Kaikeyi the sinful woman and reap the suffering."""
Ayodhya Kanda,52,20,"Sumantra the charioteer thus speaking, wept for a long time, stricken with grief, seeing Rama, equal to his soul, departing to a distance."
Ayodhya Kanda,52,21,"Then, Rama again and again spoke these sweet words as follows to that charioteer, whose tears got dried up and who had sipped some water and got himself purified:"
Ayodhya Kanda,52,22,"""I do not see any one who is as great a friend of the Ikshvakus as you are. (Pray) act in such a way that king Dasaratha may not lament about me"""
Ayodhya Kanda,52,23,"""The king, his mind afflicted with grief, is aged as well. He is pressed down by a burden of passion. Hence, I tell you this."""
Ayodhya Kanda,52,24,"""What so ever act that high-soled emperor may enjoin you to do, with intent to oblige the desire of Kaikeyi, it is to be done unhesitatingly."""
Ayodhya Kanda,52,25,"""The kings indeed rule the states with this end in view that their will may not be frustrated in any undertaking."""
Ayodhya Kanda,52,26,"""Oh, Sumantra! Carry out everything in such a way that the said emperor neither finds it unpleasing nor gets tormented by grief."""
Ayodhya Kanda,52,27,"""Only after performing respectful salutation to the old and venerable king, who has never known suffering and who has subdued his senses, you tell these words to him on my behalf."""
Ayodhya Kanda,52,28,"""Indeed neither I nor Lakshmana and Sita grieve for having moved from Ayodhya or that we are going to dwell in a forest."""
Ayodhya Kanda,52,29,"""After completing fourteen years, you will once more see Lakshmana, myself and Sita too returned apace from the forest."""
Ayodhya Kanda,52,30,"""Oh,Sumantra! This is what you should say to the king, my mother, all other queens and Kaikeyi. Tell Kausalya again and again that I am keeping good health. Thereafter, convey salutations at her feet on behalf of Sita as well as myself and Lakshmana the faithful man."""
Ayodhya Kanda,52,31,"""Tell our salutations to the emperor too. Bring Bharata quickly. After his arrival, Bharata may be installed in the position, as desired by the king."""
Ayodhya Kanda,52,32,"""When you embrace Bharata and install him in the office of the Prince Regent, the agony caused by the repentance felt by you on our account will not overpower you."""
Ayodhya Kanda,52,33,"""Bharata too is to be told thus: ""Treat without distinction all your mothers with the same regard as you behave towards the king."""

Ayodhya Kanda,52,35,"""If you accept the princely kingdom with an intent to please our father, it will be possible for you to enhance happiness in both the worlds (in this world and the next)."""
Ayodhya Kanda,52,36,"Sumantra, who was being sent back by Rama, was agonized with grief after hearing the whole of that discourse and affectionately spoke to Rama as follows:"
Ayodhya Kanda,52,37,"""If I spoke to you fearlessly in a friendly tone without following courteousness, you ought to forgive my mode of expression, considering me as your devotee"""
Ayodhya Kanda,52,38,"""How indeed can I return without you to that city, which through separation from you, has been reduced to the state of a mother stricken with grief due to separation from her son"""
Ayodhya Kanda,52,39,"""By seeing my chariot on that day even with Rama in it, the people were lamenting so much. Now, if they see the chariot without Rama the city of Ayodhya will even be broken asunder."""
Ayodhya Kanda,52,40,"""The city will be plunged in misery, like an army in which its commander is lost in a combat with the charioteer alone surviving, on seeing this chariot without you."""

Ayodhya Kanda,52,64,"Having spoken thus to the charioteer, the courageous Rama consoled him again and again. Then, he spoke the following reasoned words to Guha:"
Ayodhya Kanda,52,65,"""Oh, Guha! This stay in the inhabited woods is not proper for me. My stay should definitely be in a hermitage. Let an action diverted towards that aim be taken"""
Ayodhya Kanda,52,66,"""I as such, wishing well of my father, Sita as well as Lakshmana and having taken up a discipline to be followed by ascetics, want to proceed further, wearing matted hair. Please bring the latex of a banyan tree."""

Ayodhya Kanda,52,68,"Rama, tiger among men who possessed long arms wore the distinguished mark of an ascetic (in the shape of matted hair) . Then, Rama and Lakshmana the brothers clad in the bark of trees and wearing a round mass of matted locks (on their head) looked bright like two ascetic sages."
Ayodhya Kanda,52,69,"Having adopted the way of a hermit (temporarily) along with Lakshmana, Rama then accepted the vow of an ascetic life and spoke to Guha, his friend as follows:"
Ayodhya Kanda,52,70,"""Oh, Guha! Remain vigilant in defense, finance, internal security and public relations, for a kingdom is the most difficult one to be protected!"""
Ayodhya Kanda,52,71,"Then Rama, who was a delight to Ikshvaku dynasty, bade farewell to Guha and departed quickly, remaining undistracted, along with his consort and together with Lakshmana."
Ayodhya Kanda,52,72,"Seeing the boat on the bank of the river and keen to cross the swift- flowing Ganga, Rama spoke to Lakshmana as follows: -"

Ayodhya Kanda,52,75,"Then, the glorious Rama got into the boat himself. Thereafter, Guha the ruler of Nishadas commanded his kinsfolk to row them across the river."
Ayodhya Kanda,52,76,"After ascending the boat, Rama too of mighty splendor then recited a sacred text (daiviim naavam etc) fit for brahmanas and Kshatriyas alike and conducive to his own good."
Ayodhya Kanda,52,77,"Having sipped water as per scriptures and with extreme delight, Rama with Sita made obeisance to that river. Lakshmana, of infinite splendor, followed suit."
Ayodhya Kanda,52,78,"Bidding farewell to Guha with his army of men and Sumantra, Rama sat on the boat and directed the boatmen to move on."
Ayodhya Kanda,52,79,"Propelled by those splendid and vigorous oarsmen, that boat furnished with a pilot, rapidly moved across the water."
Ayodhya Kanda,52,80,"Coming to the middle of Bhagirathi river, the irreproachable Sita with joined palms, spoke as follows to the said river: -"

Ayodhya Kanda,52,88,"Reaching the bank and leaving the boat, Rama the best among men and the chastiser of foes proceeded further along with Lakshmana and Sita."
Ayodhya Kanda,52,89,"Then, Rama the mighty armed, spoke to Lakshmana (who heightened the joy of Sumitra) as follows:"
Ayodhya Kanda,52,90,"""Security is an inevitable need in a forest, which has unforeseen dangers and is uninhabited, Oh, Lakshmana! Go in front. Let Sita follow you."""
Ayodhya Kanda,52,91,"""I shall proceed in the rear, protecting you and Sita. Oh, jewel among men! We must accord protection here to one another."""
Ayodhya Kanda,52,92,"""An act which has gone out of hand, whatsoever, cannot indeed be remedied again. Sita will experience the hardship of staying in a forest only from now."""
Ayodhya Kanda,52,93,"""Today she will enter the forest, where density of people is not seen, which is utterly devoid of fields and gardens, has a rugged surface and is full of stumbles."""
Ayodhya Kanda,52,94,"Listening to Rama's words, Lakshmana walked in front. Immediately after Sita, Rama, the delight of Raghu dynasty, advanced."
Ayodhya Kanda,52,95,"Constantly gazing at Rama, who reached soon the other bank of Ganga River, the distressed Sumantra, his vision having failed due to the long distance and perturbed as he was, shed tears (of grief over separation from Rama)."
Ayodhya Kanda,52,96,"Having crossed the great river, Rama the high-soled, the bestowal of boons, equal in glory with the guardians of spheres, then reached progressively the prosperous and the happy land of Vatsa; which contained rows of beautiful crops."
Ayodhya Kanda,52,97,"Having hunted there four deer, namely Varaaha, Rishya, Prisata; and Mahaaruru (the four principal species of deer) and taking quickly the portions that were pure, being hungry as they were, Rama and Lakshmana reached a tree to take rest in the evening."
Ayodhya Kanda,53,1,"Rama, the foremost of those affording happiness to others, reached the aforesaid tree, worshipped the western twilight and spoke to Lakshmana as follows:"
Ayodhya Kanda,53,2,"""This might which has got past us today outside the inhabited territory is the first night which has passed without Sumantra. You ought not repent over it."""
Ayodhya Kanda,53,3,"""Remaining free from lassitude, we must both keep awake during nights, from today Lakshmana! The safety and welfare of Sita indeed depend on us two."""
Ayodhya Kanda,53,4,"""Let us pass this night anyhow, Lakshmana! Let us lie down on the ground, covering it by straw, leaves and so on, procured by our own hands."""
Ayodhya Kanda,53,5,"Streching himself on the bare ground, Rama, who was accustomed to a luxurious coach, uttered the following suitable words to Lakshmana:"
Ayodhya Kanda,53,6,"""Assuredly the emperor is sleeping badly tonight, while Kaikeyi, having realized her ambitions, ought to feel satisfied."""
Ayodhya Kanda,53,7,"""Seeing Bharata returned, queen Kaikeyi, I am afraid, may not expel the lives of the emperor for the sake of kingdom."""
Ayodhya Kanda,53,8,"""Aged and (therefore) helpless, deprived of my presence, what will he do, dominated as he is by his passion for Kaikeyi and who has fallen into the clutches of Kaikeyi."""
Ayodhya Kanda,53,9,"""Reflecting on this misfortune of the king and his mental derangement, I deem that passion alone is greater than early gain and religious merit."""
Ayodhya Kanda,53,10,"""what man however deluded, what father on account of a woman, at his own will and pleasure, abandon a son like myself?"
Ayodhya Kanda,53,11,"""Alas, Kaikeyi's son Bharata (alone) is happy along with his wife. Like an overlord, he is going to enjoy the prosperous kingdom of Kosala."""
Ayodhya Kanda,53,12,"""Father is superannuated. I am staying in the forest. Bharata will become the prime head for the entire kingdom."""
Ayodhya Kanda,53,13,"""He who pursues sensuous pleasures neglecting his real interests and discipline soon comes to distress; in the same way as king Dasaratha has."""
Ayodhya Kanda,53,14,"""It seems that Kaikeyi came into our house, oh good brother, to bring about an end to Dasaratha, to send me into exile and to secure kingship for Bharata."""
Ayodhya Kanda,53,15,"""Blinded by pride of good fortune, Kaikeyi may even now persecute Kausalya and Sumitra because of their relationship with me."""
Ayodhya Kanda,53,16,"""Queen Sumitra is likely to suffer hardship because of her affinity to us. From this very place, you proceed to Ayodhya next morning, oh, Lakshmana!"""
Ayodhya Kanda,53,17,"""I shall proceed to Dandaka forest alone with Sita, while you will be the protector for Kausalya, who has no defender."""
Ayodhya Kanda,53,18,"""Kaikeyi of base deeds may resort to unjustified means to be disliked. Give (for protection) my mother to Bharata, oh virtuous Prince!"""
Ayodhya Kanda,53,19,"""In some other (past) birth, women must have been deprived of their sons by my mother (Kausalya), oh, Lakshmana! For that reason this has arisen certainly."""
Ayodhya Kanda,53,20,"""At a time when Kausalya should have obtained benefits for her labors repaid by me, she has been deprived of my company by me, who was nurtured by her for a long time and brought up with great pains. Woe to me."""
Ayodhya Kanda,53,21,"""Let no woman ever give birth to such a son as myself, who have caused perpetual grief to my mother, oh, Lakshmana!"""
Ayodhya Kanda,53,22,"""Oh, Lakshmana! I think that myna (which is kept as a pet by mother Kausalya) is more affectionate than I, since her are heard the words, ""Bite, oh parrot, the foot of the enemy."""
Ayodhya Kanda,53,23,"""What can be done by me, her son, who cannot go to her aid even a little to her, my mother, who is weeping, who is unfortunate and who has no son, oh conqueror of foes?"""
Ayodhya Kanda,53,24,"""Kausalya my mother of poor luck indeed, bereft of me, is stricken with great melancholy and lies plunged in a sea of grief"""
Ayodhya Kanda,53,25,"""Enraged, I can subdue with my arrows single handed not only Ayodhya but also the earth. But it is not a question of valor here."""
Ayodhya Kanda,53,26,"""Oh, the sinless Lakshmana! I am terribly concerned of doing wrong and of ruining my prospects in the other world. Hence, I do not allow myself to be crowned."""
Ayodhya Kanda,53,27,"Rama during the night in that lonely forest, wailed piteously thus and in so many other ways and sat quite, his face full of tears."
Ayodhya Kanda,53,28,Lakshmana consoled Rama as follows when the later had ceased lamenting like a fire whose flames had gone out and as a sea without a violent motion.
Ayodhya Kanda,53,29,"""The city of Ayodhya, now that you have come away from it, has certainly been divested of its splendor and resembles a night without the moon, Oh, Rama the jewel among armed warriors!"""
Ayodhya Kanda,53,30,"""It is not proper, oh Rama, that you should grieve in this way. You cause distress to Sita and me too, oh jewel among men!"""
Ayodhya Kanda,53,31,"""Oh, Rama! Bereft of you , neither Sita nor I will not survive even for a moment, like fish pulled out of water."""
Ayodhya Kanda,53,32,"""Oh, Rama causing pain to the foes! Without you, I do not wish to see either our father or Satrughna or Sumitra or even the heaven."""
Ayodhya Kanda,53,33,"Then Rama and Lakshmana the lovers of piety, sitting comfortably there and on seeing a bed well- prepared under a banyan tree, sought for the bed."
Ayodhya Kanda,53,34,"Attentively hearing Lakshmana's words which were excellent and wholistic and adopting for a fairly long period the course of conduct prescribed for hermits, Rama resolved to spend all the fourteen years in exile with Lakshmana."
Ayodhya Kanda,53,35,"Thence forward, those two powerful offspring of the Raghu race (Rama and Lakshmana) never admitted fear or agitation (while dwelling) in that vast and lonely forest any more than a couple of lions on the slopes of a mountain."
Ayodhya Kanda,54,1,"Having spent the beautiful night under the big tree, Rama, Seetha and Lakshmana started from that place when the immaculate sun had risen."
Ayodhya Kanda,54,2,"Having penetrated into a deep forest, they the illustrious trios, while seeing many stretches of land and at some places, attractive scenery never seen before, proceeded in the direction of that region where river Yamuna was flowing forth towards river Ganga, associated with the name of Emperor Bhagiratha."
Ayodhya Kanda,54,3,"Observing various trees while walking at ease, Rama spoke to Lakshmana (as follows) when the day had just receded."
Ayodhya Kanda,54,4,"""Perceive, Oh Lakshmana, the smoke looking prominent as a sign of the glorious god of fire near Prayaga (the confluence of the holy Ganga and Yamuna rivers). I think that sage Bharadwaja is staying nearby."""
Ayodhya Kanda,54,5,"""We have certainly reached the confluence of rivers Ganga and Yamuna. Yes, the noise produced by clashing of waters is heard."""
Ayodhya Kanda,54,6,"""Pieces of timber split up by men who are dependent upon forest-products, as also these trees of various kinds are seen in the hermitage of Bharadwaja."""
Ayodhya Kanda,54,7,"Having walked comfortably, Rama and Lakshmana wielding their bows, reached the abode of the sage Bhardwaja, near the confluence of rivers Ganga and Yamuna, while the Sun was falling to the west."
Ayodhya Kanda,54,8,"Having reached the hermitage and scaring the beasts and birds (by his very appearance as a bowman) and having proceeded on the intervening path for a while, Rama approached the vicinity of Bharadwaja."
Ayodhya Kanda,54,9,"Arriving at the hermitage, the two valiant princes, who wished to see the sage, accompanied by Seetha, halted at first at some distance off."
Ayodhya Kanda,54,10,"Entering the hermitage and beholding the high-souled sage who was austere and contemplative, his glance sharpened through severe meditation, surrounded by a group of disciples, who had kindled sacrificial fire, the highly fortunate man as he was, Rama together with Lakshmana and Seetha greeted him with joined palms."
Ayodhya Kanda,54,11,"Rama (the elder brother of Lakshmana) introduced himself to the sage as follows: ""Oh venerable sage! We both are Rama and Lakshmana the sons of Dasaratha."""
Ayodhya Kanda,54,12,"""Here is my blessed and irreproachable wife Seetha, daughter of Janaka who has accompanied me to the lonely forest suitable for religious austerities."""
Ayodhya Kanda,54,13,"""While I was being sent to exile by my father, my young and beloved brother Lakshmana (son of Sumitra) of firm vows has also followed me to the forest."""
Ayodhya Kanda,54,14,"""Oh, Venerable sage! Commanded by our father, we are entering a lonely forest to practise asceticism, living on roots and fruits."""
Ayodhya Kanda,54,15,"Hearing the words of that virtuous prince (Rama), the pious minded sage Bharadwaja then offered Madhuparka* as well as water to wash his hands with."
Ayodhya Kanda,54,16,"The sage, who had practiced austerities, gave them various kinds of delicacies prepared from wild roots and fruits and also arranged accommodation for them."
Ayodhya Kanda,54,17,"Honouring with words of welcome, the sage Bharadwaja seated, being surrounded on all sides with beasts, birds and hermits, spoke thus to Rama."
Ayodhya Kanda,54,18,"Bharadwaja then said these endowed with righteousness to Rama, who had since taken his seat after accepting the aforesaid hospitality:"
Ayodhya Kanda,54,19,"""In fact, I am seeing you, arriving here after a long time, Oh scion of Kakutstha! And I have heard of your unjust banishment."""
Ayodhya Kanda,54,20,"""This holy place at the confluence of the two rivers is secluded and delightful. You stay here comfortably."""
Ayodhya Kanda,54,21,"Addressed in these words by Bharadwaja, Rama, born in Raghu dynasty, for his part, interested in the welfare of all, replied in the following pleasant words."
Ayodhya Kanda,54,22,"""The people of the city and the rural folks Oh venerable sir, are nearer to this place. Finding me easy to see at this place, people keen to see Seetha and myself, I presume, will make their appearance at this hermitage. For this reason, I do not wish to stay here."""
Ayodhya Kanda,54,23,"""See some excellent Seetha suitable for a hermitage in some lonely place, Oh venerable sir, where Seetha, the daughter of Janaka, who is worthy of every comfort, may find delight in it."""
Ayodhya Kanda,54,24,"Hearing these auspicious words of Rama, Bharadwaja the great sage then for his part spoke these suggestive words."
Ayodhya Kanda,54,25,"""Sixty miles from here, dear son, lies a sacred mountain on which you may takeup your dwelling, which region is inhabited by great sages, is charming to look at from all sides, infested by the black species of monkeys with a long tail, haunted by apes and bears, known by the name of Chitrakuta and which closely resembles Gandha maadana mountain."""
Ayodhya Kanda,54,26,"""As long as a man observes the peaks of Chitrakuta mountain, he will perform virtuous deeds and will never set his mind on a sin."""
Ayodhya Kanda,54,27,"""On that mountain, many sages having spent hundred years in austerities as though in sport , ascended to heaven, duly attaining their final emancipation."""
Ayodhya Kanda,54,28,"""I consider that mountain to be a very lonely and comfortable place for you to live in. Orelse stay with m here itself, during the period of your exile, Oh Rama!"""
Ayodhya Kanda,54,29,"The pious sage Bharadwaja fulfilled all desires of Rama; who was his beloved guest and who was accompanied by his consort, Seetha and his brother, Lakshmana."
Ayodhya Kanda,54,30,"While Rama, having approached that great sage at Prayaga(the confluence of Ganga and Yamuna), was discoursing on various topics, the auspicious night arrived."
Ayodhya Kanda,54,31,"Greatly fatigued, Rama(Scion of Kakutstha) accompanied by Seetha as the third (Lakshmana being the second) who was accustmed to all comforts, happily spent that night at the lovely hermitage of Bharadwaja."
Ayodhya Kanda,54,32,"When the night was gleaming into a dawn, Rama the lion among men approached the sage Bharadwaja, who was gleaming with resplendence and spoke as follows:"
Ayodhya Kanda,54,33,"""We have lodged in your hermitage tonight, Oh venerable sir! (Pray) you give us permission for fixing our residence now, Oh sage practicing truthfulness !"""
Ayodhya Kanda,54,34,"That night having come to an end, Bharadwaja replied for his part, as follows: ""Proced to Chitrakuta, rich in honey, tubers and fruits."""
Ayodhya Kanda,54,35,"""I consider the abode of Chitrakuta as the right place for you to stay, Oh Rama, possessed of great strength! You set off for that well-known, sacred and lovely mountain, Chitrakuta which is adoned with clusters of trees of every description, frequented by Kinnaras and Nagas, is rendered charming by the cried of peacocks and infested with lordly elephants and bountiful with tubers and fruits."""
Ayodhya Kanda,54,36,"""Since herds of elephants and troops of deer wander all around in the woodlands there, you will visibly notice them Oh Rama!"""
Ayodhya Kanda,54,37,"""Roaming about with Seetha, your mind will be delighted to see rivers, cascades, peaks of mountains, fissures in rocks, caves and rivulets."""
Ayodhya Kanda,54,38,"""After reaching the auspicious and absolutely beautiful Chitrakuta mountain, reveberant in all direction with the notes of small white cranes and cucukoo birds as well as with many kinds of deer and elephants in rut, settle down there in a hermitage."""
Ayodhya Kanda,55,1,"Having stayed that night there, those princes the annihilators of enemies, thereafter offered salutation to the sage Bharadwaja and proceeded towards that mountain of Chitrakuta."
Ayodhya Kanda,55,2,"That great sage Bharadwaja performed a religious rite ensuring a sage journey (scattering boiled rice on the ground and invoking blessing through the repetition of certain sacred texts0 for them. Perceiving them setting out for the journey, the sage accompanied them for a distance, as a father would do for his sons (and daughter-in-law)."
Ayodhya Kanda,55,3,Bharadwaja the great sage with a remarkable splendour began to speak the following words to Rama the truly brave man.
Ayodhya Kanda,55,4,"""After approaching Oh, the best of men! The confluence of Ganga and Yamuna, follow the river Yamuna which takes to the direction of west."""
Ayodhya Kanda,55,5,"""Reaching the River Yamuna belonging to olden times, having a rapid stream and perceiving in it a passage for descent into the river, which is too much frequented the river, which is too much frequented, you cross the River Yamuna (the daughter of the sun-god) by preparing a raft there, Oh Rama!"""
Ayodhya Kanda,55,6,"After crossing the river Yamuna and approaching a large banyan tree named Syama (dark-green) having green leaves surrounded by many tress and visited by Siddhas, Seetha should, joining her palms, recite her auspicious prayers to the tree."""
Ayodhya Kanda,55,7,"""Having approached that tree, you can stay there or go beyond it. After going only for two miles from there, you will see a beautiful forest blue in colour with bamboo trees touching upon Yamuna river and interspersed with Sallaka and jujube trees."""
Ayodhya Kanda,55,8,"""It is the way to Chitrakuta. I visited that place many times. It is beautiful, endowed with serenity and free from forest-fire."""
Ayodhya Kanda,55,9,"Having thus informed the way and ebbing urged by Rama to return after he had paid obeisance to the sage and Rama having replied ï¿½so be it', the great sage Bharadwaja returned."
Ayodhya Kanda,55,10,"That sage having returned, Rama spoke to Lakshmana as follows: ""Oh Lakshmana! We are fortunate that the sage has shown compassion towards us."""
Ayodhya Kanda,55,11,"Deliberating thus, Rama and Lakshmana the tigers among men who were highly intelligent, headed for the river Yamuna guarding Seetha still in front."
Ayodhya Kanda,55,12,"Having reached the River Yamuna, running with rapid stream, all of them then plunged into a thought of how to cross those river-waters."
Ayodhya Kanda,55,13,"Then, Rama and Lakshmana prepared a big raft with pieces of timber fastened together, covered with a kind of grass and spread over with dry bamboo canes."
Ayodhya Kanda,55,14,"Thereafter, the valiant Lakshmana made for Seetha a comfortable seat, after chopping branches of reeds and of rose apple tree."
Ayodhya Kanda,55,15,Then Rama the son of Dasaratha helped Seetha his beloved consort who was unimaginable like the goddess of fortune and who was feeling shy a little- to mount the raft.
Ayodhya Kanda,55,16,"Rama kept the two robes the jewellery, a shovel and a basket by the side of Seetha in the raft there, along with weapons."
Ayodhya Kanda,55,17,"Those valiant sons of Dasaratha firmly held that raft, firstly helped Seetha to ascend it and then ferried across the river watchfully."
Ayodhya Kanda,55,18,"Having arrived at the middle of Yamuna river, Seetha offered salutation to the river and prayed as follows: ""Oh, goddess of Yamuna! Adieu! I am crossing you! May my husband complete his vow! When Rama safely comes back again towards the city of Ayodhya, ruled by Ikshvaku kings I shall propitiate you by offering a thousand cows and a hundred drinking vessels."""
Ayodhya Kanda,55,19,"Seetha of excellent complexion thus praying with joined palms to Yamuna River, forthwith reached the southern side of the river."
Ayodhya Kanda,55,20,"Thus, by the raft, Seetha Rama and lakshmaNa crossed the River Yamuna, which flows briskly, wreathed with waves, with many trees born on its bank and having rays for it reflection."
Ayodhya Kanda,55,21,"They, who have crossed the river, abandoned the raft and march through the river-forest of Yamuna and reached a cool banyan tree called Syama having green leaves."
Ayodhya Kanda,55,22,"Having approached that banyan tree, Seetha spoke these words, ""Oh, great tree! Obeisance to you! Let my husband complete his vow! Let me see again Kausalya and the illustrious Sumitra."" Thus speaking, Seetha circumambulated that tree with joined palms."
Ayodhya Kanda,55,23,"Seeing the irreproachable Seetha, who was beloved and obedient to him thus praying, Rama spoke to Lakshmana as follows:"
Ayodhya Kanda,55,24,"""Oh, Lakshmana, the excellent of men! You take Seetha and proceed in the front. I, along with weapons, will follow you behind."""
Ayodhya Kanda,55,25,"""Give to Seetha whatever fruit or flower she desires it and wherever this Seetha's mind finds delight."""
Ayodhya Kanda,55,26,Seetha who was walking in the middle of both of them was like an auspicious female elephant in the middle of two elephants.
Ayodhya Kanda,55,27,That Seetha asked Rama whenever she saw the one or the other tree or a bush or a creeper shining with flowers which was not seen earlier.
Ayodhya Kanda,55,28,"Duly grasping Seetha's words; Lakshmana brought to her many kinds of beautiful twigs of trees, full of flowers."
Ayodhya Kanda,55,29,Then Seetha the daughter of King Janaka was please to see the River Yamuna with wonderful sands and waters re-echoing to the cry of swans and cranes.
Ayodhya Kanda,55,30,Thereafter having travelled only a couple of miles the two brothers Rama and Lakshmana killed many consecrated deer and ate in the river-forest of Yamuna.
Ayodhya Kanda,55,31,"Having strolled in the charming forest, mad noisy by a number of peacocks and which was inhabited by elephants and monkeys and reaching an agreeable level ground at the bank of the river wearing an undejected look finally sought for an abode for the night."
Ayodhya Kanda,56,1,"Then, Rama gently woke up Lakshmana, who was sleeping without break, even when the night was passing away."
Ayodhya Kanda,56,2,"""Oh, Lakshmana! Hear the sound of wild animals, resounding beautifully. It is time for our journey. Let us start."""
Ayodhya Kanda,56,3,"That Lakshmana who was sleeping, being woken up by his brother at the right moment, had relinquished sleep, sloth and strain which resulted on the way."
Ayodhya Kanda,56,4,"Thereafter, all of them raised up touched the auspicious water (took bath) in the river and proceeded towards the path leading to Chitrakuta mountain, as suggested by the sage Bharadwaja."
Ayodhya Kanda,56,5,"Rama who set out along with Lakshmana at that dawn, spoke as follows to Seetha whose eyes looked like lotus leaves."
Ayodhya Kanda,56,6,"""Oh, Seetha! Behold Kimshuka trees with their diadem of flower blossoming all over, as if they are blazing up, in this winter."""
Ayodhya Kanda,56,7,"""Look at these Bhallataka (cashew nut) trees, abounding in flowers and bent down with fruits and leaves, all unplucked by men. We can certainly live here."""
Ayodhya Kanda,56,8,"""Oh, Lakshmana! Behold in every tree the hanging honey-combs, with sizes of a water-trough, gathered by honey-bees."
Ayodhya Kanda,56,9,"In this beautiful forest-region, dense with a scattered mass of flowers, a Chataka bird is crying and a peacock is responding to it."""
Ayodhya Kanda,56,10,"""See this Chitrakuta mountain with a high and mighty peak, wide-spread with a multitude of elephants and made to resound by a congregation of birds."""
Ayodhya Kanda,56,11,"""Oh, brother! We shall sport in this forest of Chitrakuta, having a level-ground beautifully extensive with many trees and is pure."""
Ayodhya Kanda,56,12,"Thereafter, Rama and Lakshmana along with Seetha traveling on foot, approached the mountain of Chitrakuta, which was pleasant and lovely."
Ayodhya Kanda,56,13,"Reaching that mountain, with various flocks of birds, with many roots and fruits, lovely and rich in streaming water, Rama said to Lakshmana as follows:"
Ayodhya Kanda,56,14,"""It is appearing to me that this beautiful Chitrakuta mountain yields an easy sustenance, for, it is charmingly filled with various kinds of trees and creepers with different kinds of roots and fruits."""
Ayodhya Kanda,56,15,"""Oh, gentle brother! High souled sages are also staying on this mountain. Let this become the dwelling. Let us have a pleasant resort here."""
Ayodhya Kanda,56,16,"After deciding thus Seetha, Rama and Lakshmana all with joined palms approached the hermitage and offered salutation to the sage Valmiki."
Ayodhya Kanda,56,17,"The great sage Valmiki, who knew what is right, full of delight, treated them with honour, offered cordial welcome and requested them to sit."
Ayodhya Kanda,56,18,"Then Rama, the lord with mighty arms, in accord with tradition, reported to the ascetic all that concerned them and spoke to Lakshmana as follows:"
Ayodhya Kanda,56,19,"Lakshmana, my gentle brother! Bring strong and choicest timber and construct a dwelling. My mind is fascinated in dwelling here."""
Ayodhya Kanda,56,20,"Hearing those words of Rama, Lakshmana brought various kinds of trees. Thereafter, he the annihilator of enemies, constructed a leaf-hut."
Ayodhya Kanda,56,21,"Seeing that hut, which was firmly built and thatched as well as beautiful to look at, Rama spoke the following words to Lakshmana who listened to his command and who was closely attentive to him:"
Ayodhya Kanda,56,22,"""Oh, Lakshmana! Bring the meat of an antelope. We shall perform a purifactory ceremony while entering the house. Which is to be done by those who wish to live long."""
Ayodhya Kanda,56,23,"""Oh, large-eyed Lakshmana! Killing the antelope quickly, bring it here. The prescribed rite according to scriptural point of view indeed is to be performed. Keep in mind the sacred obligation."""
Ayodhya Kanda,56,24,"Lakshmana the slayer of enemies, understanding his brother's words, acted as instructed. Rama spoke again to Lakshmana as follows."
Ayodhya Kanda,56,25,"""Oh, gentle brother! Boil this antelope's meat. We shall worship the leaf-hut. This day and this instant also are of a distinctive character. Be quick."""
Ayodhya Kanda,56,26,"Then, Lakshmana the strong man and son of Sumitra, killing a holy back antelope, tossed it in an ignited fire."
Ayodhya Kanda,56,27,"Feeling certain that it is cooked and heated thoroughly with no blood remaining, Lakshmana spoke to Rama the lion among man as follows:"
Ayodhya Kanda,56,28,"""This black antelope, with its complete limbs, has been cooked completely by me. Oh, Rama resembling God! Worship the concerned deity, as you are skilled in that act."""
Ayodhya Kanda,56,29,"Rama, the virtuous man and the learned man in chanting of sacred spells, after taking bath and with subdued mind, briefly chanted all the sacred scripts to be chanted at the end of a purifactory ceremony."
Ayodhya Kanda,56,30,"Worshipping all classes of deities and getting himself purified, Rama entered the house. There was a heartful joy in rama, with his limitless splendour."
Ayodhya Kanda,56,31,"Having taken bath in the river as prescribed Rama offered oblations to Lord Rudra and Lord Vishnu after offereing tributes to Vaisvadeva. He performed benedictions relating to the purification of house and also a silent prayer as per prescribed rites. He finally offered excellent tributes to the deities, for removing sins."
Ayodhya Kanda,56,32,"Lakshmana erected altars in all the quarters of the hermitage as was fitting, Chaityas (places for worship of Lord Ganesha and others) and Ayatanas (places for worship of Vishnu and others)"
Ayodhya Kanda,56,33,"Rama and Lakshmana along with Seetha, having auspicious characteristics, satisfied the sirits by crowns of flowers obtained in the forest, by fruits roots and cooked meat, by water, by prayers as uttered in the sacred texts (Vedas), by sacred grass, by fuel and Kusa grass and then entered the auspicious leaf-hut."
Ayodhya Kanda,56,34,"All of them (Seetha, Rama and Lakshmana) together for residential purpose, entered that hut, thatched with leaves of trees, looking beautiful, well-constructed at a suitable site and protected from winds, as if entering an assembly-hall called Sudharma (in heavn) by a group of celestials."
Ayodhya Kanda,56,35,"Seetha, Rama and Lakshmana who subdued their senses, very happily strolled in that excellent forest, filled with many classes and multitude of beasts and birds, trees having multi-coloured crowns of flowers, and resonating with sounds of elephants in rut and of antelopes."
Ayodhya Kanda,56,36,"Delighted and joyful to reach the lovely Chitrakuta mountain and the river Malyavati, provided with good descents and frequented by birds and beasts, Seetha, Rama and Lakshmana shed the agony caused by their exile from the City of Ayodhya."
Ayodhya Kanda,57,1,"While Rama landed upon the southern shore, Guha conversed for a long time with Sumantra and with much distress, went to his house."
Ayodhya Kanda,57,2,"It was gathered by those who were there (Guha and others) about Seetha, Rama and Lakshmana coming to sage Bharadwaja, their staying with him in Prayaga and their departure to Chitrakuta Mountain."
Ayodhya Kanda,57,3,"Sumantra, being allowed to depart by Rama, tied excellent horses to the chariot and with intense anguish, rode towards the very city of Ayodhya."
Ayodhya Kanda,57,4,"Sumantra, seeing the sweet-smelling woods, rivers, lakes, villages and towns on the way, soon crossed them."
Ayodhya Kanda,57,5,"Reaching Ayodhya in the evening time of the third day Sumantra saw that city, joyless."
Ayodhya Kanda,57,6,"Beholding Ayodhya as if deserted in silence, Sumantra becoming very much distressed in mind and having afflicted with intense anguish, surmised as follows:"
Ayodhya Kanda,57,7,"""I hope the city of Ayodhya with its elephants, horses, people and the kings was not burnt away by a fire of sorrow and blazing grief towards Rama."
Ayodhya Kanda,57,8,"Sumantra, thus lost in thought, reaching the city-gate through the fast-running horses, entered the city quickly."
Ayodhya Kanda,57,9,"Meanwhile, seeing Sumantra the charioteer approaching, hundreds and thousands of people ran towards him asking, ""Where is Rama?"""
Ayodhya Kanda,57,10,"He replied them thus: ""Bidding farewell to Rama at the shore of Ganga when sent back by that virtuous and high-souled Rama, I returned here."""
Ayodhya Kanda,57,11,"Hearing that Seetha, Rama and Lakshmana had crossed River Ganga, the people with their faces filled with tears sighed, ""Oh, fie upon us! And cried aloud, ""Alas, Rama!"""

Ayodhya Kanda,75,58,"Kausalya spoke the following words to Bharata who was tormented with grief, was quite distraught and who just uttered formidable imprecations in the aforesaid manner:"
Ayodhya Kanda,75,59,"""O, son! My grief is further enhanced. By uttering the curses, you are indeed racking my spirits."""
Ayodhya Kanda,75,60,"""O ,son! Fortunately, your mind as it is endowed with nobility, has not swerved from righteous path. You will obtain the world of the blessed, along with Lakshmana."""
Ayodhya Kanda,75,61,"Thus speaking to Bharata who was devoted to his brother Rama, she took the valiant Bharata to her lap, embraced him and wept aloud , as she was very much afflicted with grief."
Ayodhya Kanda,75,62,"Lamenting thus, the great soled Bharata distraught on account of grief, felt himself about to swoon, with his mind crushed by the burden of grief."
Ayodhya Kanda,75,63,"To Bharata that night passed with grief in lamenting thus laying fallen unconscious on the ground, sighing warmly again and again with his power of discernment having been lost."
Ayodhya Kanda,76,1,"The sage Vasishta, the excellent one among the speakers having eloquence, spoke to that Bharata, Kaikeyi's son who was thus tormented with grief."
Ayodhya Kanda,76,2,"""O, the greatly illustrious prince! My blessing to you. You have lamented long enough. Perform in an excellent way, the last rites of the king."""
Ayodhya Kanda,76,3,"Hearing the words of Vasishta, Bharata conversant with his duty fell prostate and proceeded with all the arrangements for the obsequies."
Ayodhya Kanda,76,4,"Raising the body of king Dasaratha, from the vessel where it had been immersed in oil, seeming as it were asleep with face in the color of gold, that son Bharata placed it in a magnificent couch, adorned with every kind of precious stone and in a great grief, lamented.(as follows):"
Ayodhya Kanda,76,5,"""O, king! Having sent into exile the virtuous Rama and Lakshmana who is possessed of great strength, while I was away from home and had not yet returned, what did you intend to do?"""
Ayodhya Kanda,76,6,"""Where will you go, leaving this person (me) who was distressed and bereft of Rama the unwearied one in action and the excellent one among men?"""

Ayodhya Kanda,76,12,The fires of that king were prepared outside the chamber and kindled in accordance with the rituals by the priests and the sacrificial attendants.
Ayodhya Kanda,76,13,"The attendants were choked with tears in their throats and disconsolate in their mind, made the dead king to mount on a small palanquin and carried it away."
Ayodhya Kanda,76,14,"The people went along the path, scattering silver, gold and various kinds of clothes in front of the king."
Ayodhya Kanda,76,15,"In the same manner, some others brought sandal wood, sweet aloes, different fragrant essences, with leaps of Sarala Padmaka and Devadaru woods and many other kinds of fragrant substances, went there and threw them into the funeral pile. Thereafter the appointed priests caused the king's body to lie down there in the midst of the funeral pyre."
Ayodhya Kanda,76,16,"Then, those priests engaged for the benefit of the king poured oblations into the fire and recited sacred texts (relevant to the funeral rites). Those among the priests, who could recite the hymns of Samaveda, chanted them according to the rules."
Ayodhya Kanda,76,17,"Then, his ladies, encircled by elders mounted palanquins or other vehicles, as deserving and departed from the city to that place."
Ayodhya Kanda,76,18,"Then, the appointed priests as well as Kausalya and other women who were tormented with grief, circumambulated in anti clockwise direction that king who was lying on a funeral pile."
Ayodhya Kanda,76,19,"At that time the crying sounds of thousands of women, pitiably weeping with agony, were heard like the sounds of female curlew birds."
Ayodhya Kanda,76,20,"Thereafter, the lamenting ladies deprived of their grit wept again and again and descended from their vehicles at the bank of Sarayu River."
Ayodhya Kanda,76,21,"Along with Bharata, the royal women, the ministers and family priests offered their oblations with water and entered the city with their eyes filled in tears and spent ten days with great difficulty by sleeping on bare floor."
Ayodhya Kanda,77,1,"After having passed the tenth day of the death of Dasaratha, Bharata having himself purified, performed Shraddha* rites on the arrival of the twelfth day."
Ayodhya Kanda,77,2,"On the occasion of Shraddha rites, Bharata gave precious stones, money, a lot of cooked rice, very valuable clothes and various other kinds of presents to Brahmans."
Ayodhya Kanda,77,3,"In that ceremony performed in honor of the dead king, Bharata the son of Dasaratha gave multitudes of white goats, hundreds of cows, servants and servant maids, vehicles and very big houses to Brahmans."
Ayodhya Kanda,77,4,"Then, at the time of dawn on the thirteenth day, the mighty armed Bharata who came for clearing up bones and ashes, wept in grief, his throat being choked of sound (because of crying) and spoke in great distress the following words, having reached the foot of his father's funeral pile (to collect the bones and ashes for their immersion in Sarayu River)."
Ayodhya Kanda,77,5,"""O, father! My brother Rama to whose care I was entrusted by you, having gone on exile to the forest, I now become abandoned wholly alone, by you."""
Ayodhya Kanda,77,6,"""O, king! O, father! Where have you gone, leaving Kausalya the mother whose son Rama, her support, has been sent away from home to the forest?"""
Ayodhya Kanda,77,7,"Seeing that spot of collection (of bones), which became reddish brown in colour because of ashes, with bones consumed by fire and his father's body having extinguished, Bharata was depressed and began to cry loudly."
Ayodhya Kanda,77,8,"Miserable as he was to see the spot, Bharata fell weeping on the ground, as a flag staff fastened by any mechanical contrivance would drop down while being raised in honor of Indra the god of celestials."
Ayodhya Kanda,77,9,"All his ministers hastily approached Bharata who was virtuous in conduct, as sages once rushed to the fallen Yayati at the time of his death."
Ayodhya Kanda,77,10,"Seeing Bharata, Shatrughna was also overwhelmed with grief and while recollecting the king, fell unconscious on the ground."
Ayodhya Kanda,77,11,"Remembering the many gestures of his father resulting from his loving qualities made from time to time, Shatrughna was lamenting (as follows) like one who has lost his wits, bewildered as he was."
Ayodhya Kanda,77,12,"""We are immersed in a violent and appalling ocean of sorrow invoked by Mandhara, in which Kaikeyi in the form of a crocodile swam in its current the irrevocable boons granted to her by my father."""

Ayodhya Kanda,77,17,"""Bereft of my brother and father, I can not return to the deserted city of Ayodhya, where Ikshvaku used to reign. I shall retire to a hermitage."""
Ayodhya Kanda,77,18,"Hearing the lamentation of both of them and beholding their plight, all their companions were disturbed very much, once again."
Ayodhya Kanda,77,19,"Both Shatrughna, and Bharata were wearied with grief and began to roll on the ground, like two bulls whose horns have been broken."
Ayodhya Kanda,77,20,"Then, Vasista, a noble man, a learned man and the family priest of their father, raised up that Bharata from the ground and spoke the following words:"
Ayodhya Kanda,77,21,"""O, Lord Bharata! This is the thirteenth day of the death of your father. Why are you hanging down here, when the ceremony of collecting the bones is still unfinished?"""
Ayodhya Kanda,77,22,"""The three pairs of opposites (namely hunger and thirst, joy and sorrow; birth and death) occur to all living beings without any distinction. They being inevitable, you ought not to behave like this."""
Ayodhya Kanda,77,23,"Even Sumantra, who knew the Truth, raising up Shatrughna and pacifying him, told him about the origin and dissolution of all beings."
Ayodhya Kanda,77,24,"The two illustrious tigers among men (Bharata and Satrughna) who had got up, appeared like two banners severally raised in honor of Indra (the god of celestials) soiled through rain and the sun."
Ayodhya Kanda,77,25,"The ministers hurried up the princes, who were wiping their tears and who were talking pitiably with their eyes reddened (due to excessive weeping) to expedite the other rites pertaining to the thirteenth day."
Ayodhya Kanda,78,1,"Thereafter, Shatrughna the younger brother of Lakshmana spoke the following words to Bharata, who was tormented with grief and who desired to undertake an expedition to Rama."
Ayodhya Kanda,78,2,"""When that even-minded Rama is a refuge for all beings, how much more to tell about our seeking solace to him in our grief? He has been abandoned to the forest by a woman."""
Ayodhya Kanda,78,3,"""Why the so-called Lakshmana, the strong and powerful man, even could not rescue Rama from distress by making our father to restrain from doing it?"""
Ayodhya Kanda,78,4,"""By perceiving the prudence and imprudence in that wrong course adopted by the king, who has fallen into the clutches of a woman, Lakshmana should have restrained Dasaratha even at the beginning itself."""
Ayodhya Kanda,78,5,"While Shatrughna the younger brother of Lakshmana was talking thus, the hump-backed Manthara duly adorned with all types of ornaments, appeared at the eastern gate."
Ayodhya Kanda,78,6,"Anointed with a scent of sandal-wood and wearing royal clothes, she was bedecked with several kinds of ornaments of every description in various ways."
Ayodhya Kanda,78,7,"Studded with bright-coloured girdle-bands and many other excellent ornaments, Manthara appeared like a female-monkey tied with ropes!"
Ayodhya Kanda,78,8,"Beholding that hump-backed Manthara, the very much sinful and insensitive woman, the door-keepers caught her and delivered her to Shatrughna (with the following words:)"
Ayodhya Kanda,78,9,"""Here is that sinful and cruel woman, by whose act Rama is in the forest and your father has laid down his body. Do with her, as you consider fitting."""
Ayodhya Kanda,78,10,"Hearing those words, Shatrughna who was very much in grief and was firmly resolute, spoke to all those inmates of that gynaecium, as follows:"
Ayodhya Kanda,78,11,"""Let this woman, who created serious misfortune to my brothers and my father, receive the fruit of her cruel act."""
Ayodhya Kanda,78,12,"Speaking thus in the midst of her companions, he seized that hunch-backed woman with his powerful hand soon and she in turn made that mansion resound with her shrieks."
Ayodhya Kanda,78,13,"Then, her companion, having conceived Shatrughna's anger and extremely agonised as they were, ran away helter-shelter in all directions."
Ayodhya Kanda,78,14,"All the company of women there surmised as follows : ""The way how he is coming up, he will surely slay us all"""
Ayodhya Kanda,78,15,"""We shall take reguge with the compassionate, magnanimous, virtuous and illustrious Kausalya. Let her be the sure asylum for us."""
Ayodhya Kanda,78,16,"That Shatrughna, the tormentor of enemies, with his raging red eyes then violently dragged the crying hump-back along the floor."
Ayodhya Kanda,78,17,"While that Manthara was violently dragged, here various colourful ornaments were scattered asunder here and there on the floor."
Ayodhya Kanda,78,18,"Thus, that splendid royal mansion scattered by those ornaments, appeared very much like an autumnal sky studded with innumerable stars."
Ayodhya Kanda,78,19,"Shatrughna, the strong and the eminent man, thus violently seizing her with rage, sharply rebuked Kaikeyi and spoke harsh words to her."
Ayodhya Kanda,78,20,"Agonised very much by those harsh and painful words, Kiakeyi overwhelmed as she was with the fear of Shatrughna, took refuge with Bharata."
Ayodhya Kanda,78,21,"Seeing that enraged Shatrughna, Bharata said: ""Among all beings women are not to be killed. Hence she is to be pardoned."""
Ayodhya Kanda,78,22,"""If the pious Rama were not to express his displeasure with me for killing the mother, I would have killed this Kaikeyi, the ill-mannered and sinful woman."""
Ayodhya Kanda,78,23,"""If the virtuous Rama hears that the hunch-backed woman has been killed, it is sure that he will cease to talk to you or even to me."""
Ayodhya Kanda,78,24,"Hearing the words of Bharata, Shatrughna the younger brother of Lakshmana renouncing his guilty design forthwith released that Manthara."
Ayodhya Kanda,78,25,"Manthara fell at the feet of Kaikeyi, breathless, weeping piteously."
Ayodhya Kanda,78,26,"Seeing the hunch-backed woman, who was distraught on account of shatrughna's violence, wearing a disturbed appearance and looking like a crane that has been caught in a noose, Bharata's mother slowly consoled her."
Ayodhya Kanda,79,1,"Thereafter, early in the morning on the fourteenth day, the king-makers coming together, spoke to Bharata the following words."
Ayodhya Kanda,79,2,"""Dasaratha, who was our highly venerable master, went to heaven after sending his elder son Rama and the exceedingly strong Lakshmana to forest."""

Ayodhya Kanda,79,4,"""O, prince Bharata! Taking all the things needed for coronation, your own people (the counsellers and the ministers) as well as the citizens are awaiting for you."""
Ayodhya Kanda,79,5,"""O, Bharata the excellent among men! Take over the stable kingdom, which came in succession from your ancestors, coronate yourself and rule us."""
Ayodhya Kanda,79,6,The firmly resolute Bharata performed circumambulation clockwise around all the things kept ready for consecration and replied to all those people as follows:
Ayodhya Kanda,79,7,"""It is indeed appropriate to bestow kingship always to the eldest of our clan. You, being the conversant people, ought not to tell in this manner to me."""
Ayodhya Kanda,79,8,"""Our eldest brother, Rama will become the king. I then will reside in the forest for fourteen years."""
Ayodhya Kanda,79,9,"""Let a great and exceptionally powerful army consisting of all the four limbs be kept ready. I shall bring Rama our elder brother from the forest."""
Ayodhya Kanda,79,10,"""Keeping in front, all the assembled requisites needed for consecration, I shall proceed to the forest for the sake of bringing back Rama."""
Ayodhya Kanda,79,11,"""Consecrating him, the tiger among men there itself, I shall surely bring Rama solemnized in front, as bringing home the sacred fire from a sacrificial rite, after performing it outside the city."""
Ayodhya Kanda,79,12,"""I shall not make her, my so-called mother, fulfil her desire. I will reside in the impassable forest. Rama will become the king."""
Ayodhya Kanda,79,13,"""Let a path-way be prepared by those skilled in that profession, by leveling the uneven surfaces. Let guards who can easily move in the inaccessible forests accompany us in the path."""
Ayodhya Kanda,79,14,"Hearing Prince Bharata, talking in consideration of Rama's cause, all the people replied in the following illustrious and excellent words:"
Ayodhya Kanda,79,15,"""Let the gracious goddess of prosperity abide with you, who are speaking thus, desirous of giving kingdom to Rama the eldest son of the king."""
Ayodhya Kanda,79,16,"Hearing those excellent words spoken by the prince close to their ears, tears born of joy fell from the face and eyes of those venerable men."
Ayodhya Kanda,79,17,"Hearing these words, the people there along with council and the ministers felt cheerful, being relieved of their anxiety and spoke the following words : ""As per your command, devoted men and a group of artisans have been instructed to make the path-way."""
Ayodhya Kanda,80,1,"Then, those able to advise on the nature of soils, those skilled in thread-holding for leveling purposes, those who were energetic courageous and attentive in doing their jobs, excavators, mechanics, labourers, carpenters, road-menders, wood-cutters, hollow-makers, men skilled in plastering and white washing, basket makers, tanners and skilled supervisors of work sallied forth in advance."
Ayodhya Kanda,80,2,That mighty assembly of men gladly setting out to that forest was splendid like an ocean on the day of the full moon having a gigantic commotion.
Ayodhya Kanda,80,3,"Men skilled in making roads, furnished with tools of every kin, seeking the company of men of their own proper place, marched ahead."
Ayodhya Kanda,80,4,"Clearing away rows of creepers and shrubs timber and big rocks as well as variours kinds of trees (which obstructed the way), they carved out a path."
Ayodhya Kanda,80,5,"Some men planted trees in tree-less areas. Some others chopped the existing trees here and there by means of axes, hatchets and sickles."
Ayodhya Kanda,80,6,Some other strong men removed sturdy tufts of Virana grass and leveled the uneven places here and there.
Ayodhya Kanda,80,7,Some others filled up wells and extensive pits with earth. Some men leveled low-lying places all around.
Ayodhya Kanda,80,8,"Then, some men bridged the steams that could be bridged, pulverised the rocks that could be pulverised and smashed (the impediments that blocked the flow of water) those which could be smashed."
Ayodhya Kanda,80,9,"Many ponds, in various sizes and shapes containing plenty of water resembling seas were built (by constructing dams on rivulets)."
Ayodhya Kanda,80,10,"In water-scarce areas, excellent wells in various shapes were dug duly decorated all around with platforms (to rest)."
Ayodhya Kanda,80,11,"That track of the troops, having its surface inlaid with cement, with flowering trees inlaid with cement, with flowering trees on both sides, inhabited with birds in excitement making their sounds, adorned with flags on its either side with its surface sprinkled with water of sandal-wood fragrance, and decorated with various kinds of flowers, looked very much splendid like the path of celestials."
Ayodhya Kanda,80,12,"Those officers appointed for execution of the work, as ordered by Bharata, skillfully instructed their work-men and erected a tent which was intended for the great-souled Bharata, in a beautiful place abundant with tasty fruits. They further adorned profusely with decorations, the tent which itself resembled on ornament."
Ayodhya Kanda,80,13,The connoisseurs erected the tents of the high-souled Bharata at auspicious hours in days when the stars were propitious.
Ayodhya Kanda,80,14,"Those camps, with many breast works of sand, moats surrounding each of them, streets as resplendent as sapphires, their crowns of terrets, the ramparts covered with stucco to protect then, the splendid banners, the skillfully laidout avenues, lofty mansions the tops of which were provided with dove-cots, which flew about as it were in the air and in splendour, resembled the capitals of Indra."
Ayodhya Kanda,80,15,"The route thus prepared, extended upto the Ganga River, whose pure and limpid waters, abounding in great fish, flowed between woods and forests of every kind."
Ayodhya Kanda,80,16,"That beautiful royal high way, which was built gradually by efficient engineers, appeared as resplendent as a night in a clear sky, illumined by the moon with its procession of stars."
Ayodhya Kanda,81,1,"Then, bards and pangegyrists, who knew the importance of tidings, eulogized Bharata with auspicious hymns of praise on the night preceding Naandimukha."
Ayodhya Kanda,81,2,"A drum from the sound of which nigh-hours are identified, struck with a golden stick, gave its sound. Couches and loud-sounding instruments in hundreds producing various types of noises were blown."
Ayodhya Kanda,81,3,"That mammoth sound of the musical instruments, as if filling up the whole sky, created further distress and grief to Bharata who was already tormented with grief."
Ayodhya Kanda,81,4,"Then, the awakened Bharata proclaiming that ""I am not the king"", caused to stop that sound and spoke the following words to shatrughna:"
Ayodhya Kanda,81,5,"""Behold, O, Shatrughna! How much harm was done to the world by Kaikeyi! The king Dasartha left us, leaving all sorrows to me."""
Ayodhya Kanda,81,6,"""This prosperous kingdom of Ayodhya, a foundation of law and religion of that high-souled Dasaratha the righteous king is now like boat without a rudder moving hitter and thither in water."
Ayodhya Kanda,81,7,"""Even that Rama, who was a great protector has been sent to the forest by this very mother of mine, abandoning her righteousness."""
Ayodhya Kanda,81,8,"Seeing Bharata who lost his consciousness by lamenting in that way, all the women then miserably cried in one voice."
Ayodhya Kanda,81,9,"While Bharata was lamenting thus, the great illustrious Vasishta who knew the rules relating to kings, entered the assembly-hall of Dasaratha the Lord of Ikshvaku dynasty."
Ayodhya Kanda,81,10,"The pious minded Vasishta along with his attendants entered that lovely assembly-hall, made of gold and studded with gems and jewels, resembling Sudharma the celestial assembly-hall."
Ayodhya Kanda,81,11,"Vasista, who knew all the scriptures, then sat in a presidential chair made of gold and wrapped with a comfortable cushion. He ordered the messengers as follows:"
Ayodhya Kanda,81,12,"""Quickly bring Brahmanas (a class of people having divine knowledge), Kshatriyas (people belonging to warrior-class), Vaisyas (agriculturists and traders), ministers and troop commanders coolly. There is an urgent duty indeed for us to be done."

Ayodhya Kanda,81,14,"There was a huge hallooing sound generated while the people invited were coming on chariots, horses and elephants."
Ayodhya Kanda,81,15,People of high position like ministers and other welcomed the approaching Bharata in every way as they had welcomed Dasaratha and as Indra was welcomed by celestials.
Ayodhya Kanda,81,16,"That royal assembly, made splendid by Bharata the son of Dasartha, radiated as before as with the presence of Dasaratha, like a lake of tranquil waters sown with pearls shells and sand and filled with great fish and serpents."
Ayodhya Kanda,82,1,"Bharata endowed with understanding, saw that assembly, enriched with the whole body of respectable men, looking like a night in full moon duly enriched with well-known planets."
Ayodhya Kanda,82,2,That excellent assembly was aglow with the brilliance of clothes and scented cosmetics of its respected members occupying their appropriate seats.
Ayodhya Kanda,82,3,That beautiful assembly filled with learned men looked like a night with autumn full moon.
Ayodhya Kanda,82,4,"Beholding all the entire body of ministers of the king, Vaishta the knower of righteousness uttered to Bharata the following soft-spoken words:"

Ayodhya Kanda,82,9,"Hearing those words, the pious Bharata was filled with distress and thirsting for justice got his mind fixed on Rama."
Ayodhya Kanda,82,10,"The youthful Bharata, with a voice of a Hamsa bird, in the midst of the assembly, lamented in a tearful and appealing speech. He even reproached his royal priest as follows:"
Ayodhya Kanda,82,11,"""How can a man such as I, rob the throne from one, who practices Brahmacharya (continence and chastity), versed in the science of the Vedas (sacred scriptures) and who is devoted to duty?"""
Ayodhya Kanda,82,12,"""How should one born of Dasaratha become the usurper of a crown? Both the kingdom and I myself belong to Rama. You ought to tell the law and justice in this matter."""

Ayodhya Kanda,82,21,"The pious minded Bharata, who had an affection for his brother spoke as aforesaid and uttered the following words to Sumantra who was clever in giving counsel and who was sitting nearby."
Ayodhya Kanda,82,22,"""O, Sumantra! Rise quickly and go. As per my orders, arrange for the jorney immediately. Bring the army also."""
Ayodhya Kanda,82,23,"Hearing the words of the magnanimous Bharata, Sumantra joyfully arranged all that in accord with Bharata's orders and wishes."

Ayodhya Kanda,82,29,"Bharata, born in Raghu dynasty who was sincere in his purpose a powerful man having strong and mighty prowess and whose talk was most appropriate, then spoke as follows: intending (to undertake a journey) to persuade his illustrious elder brother, staying in dreary woods, to return to Ayodhya."
Ayodhya Kanda,82,30,"""O, Sumantra! Rise up and proceed quickly to inform the army-chief to arrange for the troops. After propitiating that Rama staying in the forest, I want to bring him back to Ayodhya for the welfare of the people."""

Ayodhya Kanda,119,19,"""O, Rama! They devour an ascetic or a celibate, who has not rinsed his mouth after finishing his meal or who is inattentive in this great forest. (Pray ward them off!"""
Ayodhya Kanda,119,20,"""O, Rama! Here is the path of the great sages, through which they fetch the fruits in this forest. It is appropriate for you to go by this path in this dangerous forest."""
Ayodhya Kanda,119,21,"Thus addressed by those Brahmanas having great asceticism, who, with joined palms paid obedience to him and blessed his journey, Rama the harasser of his foes entered the forest with his consort along with Lakshmana, as sun enters a mass of clouds."
Aranya Kanda,1,1,"Rama, Seetha, and Lakshmana enter the great forest called Dandaka Forest and adore the eminent sages, who are in penance and hermitages in that forest. This canto is named as Aranya Kanda not just to show that Rama roved over just forests. The forests, as per Indian tradition, are the treasure houses of knowledge, and they are the ultimate in Vedic culture."
Aranya Kanda,1,2,"Thus, until Ayodhya Kanda Rama's exile is in aaryavarta , the place of noblemen, from River Ganges to Greece. Now Rama is stepping into an area called janasthana,meaning people's place. This janasthana is the place where Rama eradicated certain negative aspects of the then anarchic individualised dominions where jungle law was the only recourse and brought all of them under one roof. Though people lived there about along with sages and demons as well, demonic influence is said to be predominant, as per Ramayana or other Purana-s. These demons are narrated to be man-eaters, but not cannibals who eat their own tribesmen.Recent discoveries revealed that the first humans were cannibals."
Aranya Kanda,1,3,"The Science magazine reported about the excavations at Neanderthals Neander Valley, Germany. In the words of Alban Defleur of the Universite de la Mediterranee at Masrseilles, France, ""The finding allows us for the first time to demonstrate the existence of the practice of cannibalism by European eanderthals."" It is not clear from the excavations of Neanderthals, whether the cannibalism was practised for survival or as a ritual.And even at Alveston in the western English country of Gloucestershire, recently found are such human thighbones, which had been split down the middle to remove marrow. Archaeologists of Bristol University are saying that the evidence indicated the victims could have been disabled and deformed people in society. They have been murdered and eaten, and the radiocarbon dating suggests these finds are about 2000 years ago. This practice is attributed to some underworld cults during the later Iron Age. That being the situation in Europe, in the knowable history, in Ramayana that has happened in an unknown era, the rakshasa-s are narrated to be man-eaters, but not as cannibals.But the accounts given in Aranya Kanda and elsewhere, in ancient India the rakshasa-s ate up humans neither for their own survival nor for ritual but to exhibit their tyranny and their barbaric supremacy. They never reported to have eaten their own clansmen, but have a palate for other breed. Hence it is not exactly cannibalism, but a barbaric act to exert savage scare. This is what the sages advise Rama, Seetha and Lakshmana when departing towards Dandaka Aranya, and indirectly suggest eradicating such a savage atmosphere in peaceful forests."
Aranya Kanda,1,4,"When it comes to isms , it is said that the whole clash is between Vaishnavaites and Shaivites or Shaaktaites , because the raakshasa-s are invariably Shiva worshippers, where Vaishnavism is a later development. All the raakshasa-s or demons [in fact the term 'demon' do not suit them,] portrayed hereafter, are ardent worshippers of Shiva, and have every blessing from Shiva or Brahma. It is an ethnicity of its own which lived rich lives, pompous in attributes, wielded magical powers, and unabatedly performed anything that is beneficial for them.Their riches and glory will be reflected in Sundara Kanda, which will be burnt down by Hanuma, humbling this deleterious ethnicity, even before Rama's war with Ravana. Such an ethnic culture will be portrayed hereafter, in constant conflict with Rama, and Rama eradicating each and every member of such ethnicity that goes against any civility."
Aranya Kanda,1,5,"Rama does much good in jansthana in wiping out those cultures of greedily dictatorial, magically overpowering, and ruinous to other forms of civility. In fact this Aranya Kanda is not explained in vivid terms by the ancient commentators, and if things are probed deeper in this book, Aranya Kanda, Rama did more social work than miracles.Hence much can be explored into this Aranya Kaanda, the Book of Forest, in terms of sociological, demographically and ethnological pursuits of Rama to establish one great orderly civil empire under one emperor, that is what we call Rama Raajya. Further, it will be narrated that Rama killed these Rakshasas in thousands, which is objected by materialists as how can an archer eliminate so many thousands of Rakshasas, with just a bow and arrows.It may be remembered that Sage Viswamitra accords many kinds of missiles to Rama, after the killing of Tataka, the demoness, in Bala Kanda.It may not be surprising for this generation to know that a single trigger can create havoc of Hiroshima or Nagasaki, and then in all its probability Rama also might have triggered in the same way, with the missiles endowed by Sage Viswamitra."
Aranya Kanda,1,1,On entering the impenetrable Dandaka forest that courageous and unassailable Rama saw a clusters of hermitages of sages.
Aranya Kanda,1,2,"Overspread with Darbha, the sacred grass, and jute clothing, well pervaded with Vedic splendour and well glowing like the un-seeable solar arena in the sky, with naked eye."
Aranya Kanda,1,8,"On looking at the rising red sun, the devotee is asking ""Oh! Pooshan! God Sun, nourisher of the universe, the trueness of the Supreme is covered by your golden disk like vessel, [i.e., your Solar disk,] slide it aside, for as a truthful and righteous devotee, I visualize [that which is beyond your golden Solar disc.]"
Aranya Kanda,1,3,"Those hermitages have well-tidied thresholds on all sides, dense with many deer and teemed with many groups of birds, and they are the recourse for all living beings."
Aranya Kanda,1,10,"Those hermitages are always adored by groups of apsarasa-s with their continued dancing, their Holy Fireplaces are very broad, and are with oblation items, vessels, deerskins and sacred grass, and they are beaming forth with gigantic trees that yield sacred and palatable fruits, and with ritual fuels, and water vessels, tubers and fruits. [3-1-4, 5]"
Aranya Kanda,1,6,"Those hermitages are sacrosanct for Ritual fire is being worshiped with fire-oblations and sacrifices to the reverberating Vedic sounds, and they are enwrapped with lotus ponds with lotuses, and even with flowers of forest."
Aranya Kanda,1,7,"They have age-old saints with controlled senses who are clad in jute cloths and deerskin, and who subsist on fruits and tubers alone, ye their resplendence is like that that of the Sun-god or the Fire-god."
Aranya Kanda,1,8,"Rama has seen such a cluster of hermitages that is glistening forth just by the presence of holy saints whose sustenance is constrained, and that hermitage is distinctive like Brahma's abode, reverberating with the sounds of that Brahma's Vedic chants alone."
Aranya Kanda,1,14,"That glorious and great resplendent Rama on seeing those precincts of hermitage that is graced with highly blest Brahmans, the knowers of Brahma, neared it, unstringing the bowstring of his great bow. [3-1-9-10a]"
Aranya Kanda,1,15,"Those great sages, the possessors of divine knowledge, are gladdened on seeing Rama and illustrious Seetha, and they moved towards them welcomingly. [3-1-10-11a]"
Aranya Kanda,1,16,"But those sages who are austerely committed to vows, on their seeing Rama, the treader on the path of rectitude, and who is now arising like moon, and at Lakshmana and at glorious Seetha as well, rendered Vedic blessings and welcomed the trio. [3-1-11a-12]"
Aranya Kanda,1,13,"Those forest-dwelling sages saw the physical built, its augustness and gracefulness, and his fine attire remaining in astonished postures."
Aranya Kanda,1,18,"The forest-dwellers saw Seetha, Lakshmana and Rama, without a wink on their own eyes, as that trio is causing surprise with their arrival."
Aranya Kanda,1,19,"The forest-dwellers saw Rama, Seetha, and Lakshmana without a wink on their own eyes [like celestial beings, who do not have the winking property on their eyes like living beings,] as their arrival is causing surprise."
Aranya Kanda,1,14,"The forest-dwellers saw Rama, Seetha, and Lakshmana without a wink on their own eyes [as though the Vishnu along with Goddess Lakshmi and Thousand headed-serpent, aadi sheSha are coming from their abode vaikunTha to this hermitage, for this hermitage is like Brahma's abode, as already said, thus the sages lost their wink. And loosing any single wink will loose the sight of these divinities from vaikunTha; hence their unannounced arrival caused surprise in them, which further caused a wink-less state"
Aranya Kanda,1,15,"Those august sages that are interested in the well being of all beings have indeed accommodated Rama in that hermitage, as Rama is their guest a priori."
Aranya Kanda,1,17,"Then those august sages who are similar to sacred fire in glow have procedurally accorded guestship to Rama, and fetched water for him."
Aranya Kanda,1,23,"On sounding out Vedic blessings those virtuous sages have offered flowers, fruits and tubers, and even the entire hermitage to that great soul Rama, and then with their palms adjoined. [3-1-17-18a]"
Aranya Kanda,1,24,"""The king will have great renown for he is the ruler of the righteousness of these people, a protector, a respectable and adorable one, and as he wields the sceptre of justice, he is a revered one too... [3-1-18-19a]"

Aranya Kanda,1,23,"Thus other saints and sages who are the followers of the virtue, and similar to the Sacred Fire adored Rama, the king, according to the wont of custom."
Aranya Kanda,2,1,"Then, on receiving the hospitality in that hermitage for that day, and on the next day before sunrise, Rama bade farewell to all of the sages, and thus entered the deep forests."
Aranya Kanda,2,2,"Rama followed by Lakshmana has indeed seen that midst of the forest which is filled with very many animal herds, where the bears and tigers are frequenting, and whose trees, creepers, bushes are ruined, water ponds rendered unsightly, birds song-less, but where the swarms of crickets are whistling deafeningly.

Aranya Kanda,2,6,"Wearing tiger's skin that is wetted with fat and dampened with blood, he is frightening to all beings like the wide-open mouth of Death."
Aranya Kanda,2,6,"He skewered three lions, four tigers, two wolves, ten spotted deer, and a big head of an elephant with tusks and fouled with fat on an iron spear, and he is yelling with his deafening voice. [3-2-7-8a]"

Aranya Kanda,2,21,"""To me, oh, Soumitri, the grief of others touching Seetha is more, than father's demise or grabbing away my kingdom..."
Aranya Kanda,2,22,"When said thus by Rama, Lakshmana said this with flooding tears of lament, and in his anger hissing like a forestalled snake."
Aranya Kanda,2,23,"""Oh, Rama, you being the Indra like lord of all beings, and while you are being attended by an adherent like me, what for you worry yourself like a derelict?"

Aranya Kanda,2,24,"The forest Dandaka Forest wherein Rama is trekking is a dominion of their kingdom, but a deserted forest. One named Danda, the last son of Ikshvaku, was performing all demonic activities in their kingdom. His father Ikshvaku received many a complaint about Danda's deeds from his subjects, and angered at his erring son Danda and banishes him from the kingdom."
Aranya Kanda,2,25,"Danda took refuge in Vindhya mountain range and built a kingdom and a beautiful capital for himself called Madhumanta. He rubbed shoulders with all the demons thereabout and thus became a disciple of Sage Shukraachaarya, the guru of demons. One day when Sage Shukraachaarya is not in hermitage, Danda reaches there, and sees Araja, the elder daughter of the sage Shukra, and molests her, in spite of her repeated protests. Later when Sage Shukraachaarya comes to know about it, gets enraged and curses Danda, to fall down along with his entire kingdom under a mud storm around that Madhumanta capital for a period of seven consecutive days."
Aranya Kanda,2,26,"Then there is a mud storm for seven days and entire kingdom went under mud, later to become a forest called Dandaka. The place to where the curse fearing people fled from that Madhunata to further south is called Jansthaana. At later time, when Rama's peregrination started, these two places, Dandaka forest and Janasthaana, are under the domain of Ravana, and Ravana made one demon named Khara, as the protector of this dominion Jansthaana."
Aranya Kanda,2,27,"This is the place where Rama built his hermitage Panchavati, at which Demoness Surpanakha arrives, and from where Ravana abducts Seetha. When Rama asks the forest dwelling sages for a quiet place to live on, the sages in Dandaka forest, will make Rama constantly move southward, till he reaches Janasthana, indirectly directing Rama to eradicate the demonic influence over these places, which once belonged to Rama's kingdom."
Aranya Kanda,3,1,"Then in his turn that demon Viradha said this sentence filling the forest with his gruesome voice, ""I am asking you, really... tell me who you are and whereto you wish to go? """
Aranya Kanda,3,2,Then that highly resplendent Rama said about his Ikshvaku dynasty to the blazing faced demon who is insistent.
Aranya Kanda,3,3,"""Know us as Kshatriya-s with ennobled bearing, and we are trekking the forest...but we wish to know about you, who are you that move about in Dandaka forest?"
Aranya Kanda,3,4,"Viradha said to that truly valiant Rama, ""Ah! I'll tell you, oh king, be informed of me, oh Raghava..."
Aranya Kanda,3,5,"""I am the son of Java indeed... my mother is Shatahradaa, and all the demons on earth call me Viradha...'"
Aranya Kanda,3,6,"""On my undertaking ascesis I derived a boon from the beneficence of Brahma, by which I will neither be cut, nor slit, nor killed with a weapon in this world..."""
Aranya Kanda,3,7,"""Leave off this lady without any yearning for her, and you expeditiously flee-away as you have come, then your lives will not be snatched away..."
Aranya Kanda,3,8,"Rama in reply said this to that ogre Viradha, whose eyes are fully bloodshot in anger, who is monstrous in his body, and evil in intent..."
Aranya Kanda,3,9,"""You knave, fie upon you... you are in quest of you own death for your meanly measures, and definitely you will get it in this confrontation. Stay! I will not let you to live..."
Aranya Kanda,3,10,"Then, stringing his bow Rama indeed darted very sharp arrows, very quickly and well aiming the demon..."
Aranya Kanda,3,11,"Indeed seven arrows are let off with perfectly stringed bow, which have golden vanes, and very fast ones that equal the flights of Garuda, the Divine Eagle and the Air-god."
Aranya Kanda,3,12,"But, they the arrows that are akin to infernos and dressed with peacock feathers as their fins, on piercing the body of Viradha they fell onto the ground besmirched with blood."
Aranya Kanda,3,13,"When that demon is thus struck, then he placed Vaidehi down from his arms, hauled up his spear, and very angrily rushed towards Rama and Lakshmana."
Aranya Kanda,3,14,"And holding fast his spear that is similar to the Indra's Flagstaff he blaringly yelled a ghastly shriek, and thus he shone forth like the wide-mouthed Death, ready-to-gulp."
Aranya Kanda,3,15,"Then with an effulgent arrow-rain those two brothers incessantly rained on demon Viradha, who is similar to the terminator of lifetime."
Aranya Kanda,3,16,"He that highly horrendous demon laughed at that arrow-shower, and standing for a while he yawned, and on his yawning and stretching his limbs in fatigue those arrows that earlier have gone speedily, spilled out from his body that speedily."
Aranya Kanda,3,17,"Demon Viradha held back his lives by the touch of boon, and raising up the spear he ran quickly at Rama and Lakshmana."
Aranya Kanda,3,18,"The best wielder of weaponry Rama ripped that spear apart, which is akin to the Thunderbolt of Indra, and that which is like a blaze in the sky, with two arrows in the sky itself."
Aranya Kanda,3,19,Shattered by Rama's blazing shafts that spear fallen on ground like the boulder mass of Mt. Meru when it is shattered by Indra's Thunderbolt.
Aranya Kanda,3,20,"They quickly upraised their swords and like a pair of up-swinging black-cobras they rapidly crashed on him, and then battered him mightily."
Aranya Kanda,3,21,"He that demon thus beaten very firmly by Rama and Lakshmana, then on grabbing those unwavering ones and manly tigers with his arms, that furious demon wished to carry them away."
Aranya Kanda,3,22,"Knowing the thinking of the demon for sure, Rama spoke to Lakshmana, ""Let him easily carry us anywhere on his way..."
Aranya Kanda,3,23,"""Let this demon carry us as he wishes, and Saumitri, by which way this night-walker goes, that alone will be our way..."
Aranya Kanda,3,24,"But he that night-walker arrogant as he is by his might has uplifted Rama and Lakshmana like babies by that might and courage alone, and placed them on his shoulders as one would place babies."
Aranya Kanda,3,25,That nightwalker Viradha on placing those two Raghava-s on his shoulders gone towards deeper forest yelling very luridly.
Aranya Kanda,3,26,"That demon entered into a baffling forest that is like a very dark cloud in its sheen, where a variety of massive trees are contained in, numerous flocks of vulturine birds are overspreading, and where wild jackals and other predaceous animals are sprawling around, along with Rama and Lakshmana."
Aranya Kanda,3,27,"Ikshvaku dynasty is of long lineage. This is Surya Vamsha, Solar dynasty of Kshatriya-s, of which Mahaa Kavi Kalidasa wondered as to how it can be narrated, for it is of a long lineage and he admires kvaH suurya prabhavo vamshH ... in his Raghu Vamsha Mahaa Kaavya, at 1-2.

Aranya Kanda,4,3,"""Wild bears, tigers and panthers aspire to eat me away... oh, best demon, thieve me instead and release Kakutstha-s... Hail to thee..."" [Said Seetha.]"
Aranya Kanda,4,4,On hearing Vaidehi's that utterance those valorous ones Rama and Lakshmana speedily busied themselves in eliminating that evil-minded demon Viradha.
Aranya Kanda,4,5,"Soumitri indeed severed the left arm of that ferocious one, while Rama rent the right arm of that demon with his might."
Aranya Kanda,4,6,"When his arms are mutilated that demon similar to a dark-cloud is frustrated, fainted, and fell onto ground, like the mountain demolished by the Thunderbolt of Indra."
Aranya Kanda,4,7,"They battered that demon with their fists, hands and feet, and even by heaving and hurling him again and again they entirely pounded on him on the ground."
Aranya Kanda,4,8,"Though that demon is battered with many arrows, even sheared off with two swords, and even though he is entirely pounded on the ground he is not killed."
Aranya Kanda,4,9,"On observing that the mountain-similar demon is ineradicable that easily, then Rama, the sublime one, and the bestower of shelter in fear, spoke this sentence to Lakshmana."
Aranya Kanda,4,10,"""Oh! Manly-tiger Lakshmana, it is impossible to overpower this demon with weapons in a confrontation, hence, let's bury this demon..."
Aranya Kanda,4,11,"""Lakshmana, a very deep pit be dug for this furious and ferocious reprobate in this forest, as though for an elephant..."
Aranya Kanda,4,12,"On saying to Lakshmana that ï¿½a trench shall be dug...' then Rama repressively placed his foot on the throat of Viradha, and stood by."
Aranya Kanda,4,13,"On hearing that said by Raghava, demon Viradha sincerely spoke these humble words to Rama, the finest one from Kakutstha dynasty."
Aranya Kanda,4,14,"""Dead I am, oh! Manly-tiger and a coequal of Indra in your strength... I have fallaciously not identified you earlier... oh, best one among men..."

On saying to Lakshmana that ï¿½a trench shall be dug...' then Rama repressively placed his foot on the throat of Viradha, and stood by. [3-4-24b, 25, 26]"
Aranya Kanda,4,27,"Then, on taking a digging tool Lakshmana dug a deep pit beside the great soul Viradha."
Aranya Kanda,4,28,"On releasing his throat from the stamping of Rama, he that long eared, lurid voiced Viradha is ensconced in that pit while he is still blaring with his horrific voice."
Aranya Kanda,4,29,"Those deftly victorious ones Rama and Lakshmana who compose themselves in a given fight, both have gladly raised that Viradha, a ghoulish one in fight, a terrifying demon who is still blaring, with all their might and hurled him into the pit."
Aranya Kanda,4,30,"On observing the indestructibility of that demon with any weapon, however sharp it might be, those two best ones among men that are very expertly skilled have thought over well and undertook the elimination of that great demon in a pit."
Aranya Kanda,4,31,"Viradha himself preferred his death at the hands of Rama and desired for a long to be killed by Rama and that forest walker himself appraised that, ""Killing me with any weapon is impossible..."""
Aranya Kanda,4,32,"On listening to that which is said by Viradha, Rama resolved his mind to cast him into pit, and when that mighty demon is being flung into the pit the whole forest blared with that demon's cries."
Aranya Kanda,4,33,"Rama and Lakshmana felt happy by way of their look in burying Viradha in the pit of the earth, and on burying him they two felt rejoiced for gone is the fear in that great forest, and within the pit they have also concealed him with boulders in order to make it a burial-chamber to the departed soul."
Aranya Kanda,4,34,"Then they two who have dazzling golden bows have eliminated that demon and retrieved Seetha, and they gladly journeyed on in that great forest like the two entities abiding on the skies, namely the Sun and Moon."
Aranya Kanda,4,32,"The episode of Viraadha assumes some importance in Hindu mythology. It may be observed that Viraadha drops down Seetha, lifts and carries Rama and Lakshmana far away from Seetha, where Rama and Lakshmana kill Viraadha. aadhyaatma raamaayana which occurs in the chapter 61 of brahmaanmda puraana also narrates this episode of Viradha as a one to one fight, herein Rama affronts and kills him straight. But in Valmiki Ramayana, Viradha takes away Seetha first and then Rama and Lakshmana, too. A question arises as to why the demon should snatch Seetha away and later carry Rama and Lakshmana to a distant place from Seetha. It is part of the scheme that Rama kills no demon or sinner in the presence of Seetha, including Ravana, for she is that benevolent one to all the sinners and pardons them if surrendered in faith at her feet, as an incarnation of Goddess Lakshmi. Our concern here is with skaanda purana , a Shiva Puraana, in which Viradha's episode is explained detailedly. The skaanda puraana puts it as:"
Aranya Kanda,4,33,"On seeing Seetha Viraaadha thought, "" She is the Supreme goddess through whom heavens can be obtained by salvation and also release from the bondage [of demon's body ] On just seeing Her, relieved is this body cage, so with all my devotion, I steal Her ."" etc. Hence vi raadha meant to be verily, devout, like Radha of Krishna. When chased and hurt by Rama and Lakshmana, the demon releases Seetha, but carries both the brothers away. For this distancing Rama and Lakshmana from Seetha, it is said that Rama does not kill any demon in the presence of Seetha, for she graciously condones the mischief of the demons, if they are true devotees."
Aranya Kanda,4,34,"Again in skaanda puraana, at the end of this Viraaadha episode, the phala shruti [Fruit of Listening] it is narrated as:"
Aranya Kanda,5,1,"After killing that stupendously mighty demon Viradha in forest, then Rama comfortingly embraced Seetha, and spoke to his brother Lakshmana who is beaming forth with resplendence."
Aranya Kanda,5,2,"""Difficult is this impassable forest, nor we are forest inhabitants either... let's go quickly to that ascetically rich sage Sharabhanga..."" [3-5-2b, 3a]"
Aranya Kanda,5,3,"On his approach at the hermitage of Sage Sharabhanga, a sage with a divine effect and the one with a purified soul, saw a great wonder at the nearby of that hermitage of Sharabhanga.[3-5-3b, 4]"
Aranya Kanda,5,4,"Rama has seen Indra, the lord of three worlds, with a radiant body that has the coupled radiance of Sun and Fire, mounted on a great chariot that does not touch the earth, wearing greatly brilliant ornaments and attired in spotless dress, while the other divinities are attending, and many more selfsame great-souls are worshipping him. [3-5-5, 6, 7a]"
Aranya Kanda,5,5,"Rama saw at his very nearby a chariot yoked with green horses that traverses in firmament, which in its splendour is either like the noontime sun, or a cluster of silver clouds, or like the silvern sphere of the moon. [3-5-7b, 8]"
Aranya Kanda,5,6,"He saw the stainless parasol of Indra, marvellously garlanded and shining forth, and the exemplary and invaluable royal fanning instruments with golden handles, which two best female celestials are handling and fanning at Indra's head sides with them. [3-5-9, 10a]"
Aranya Kanda,5,7,"And the celestials like gandharva-s, amara-s, siddhaa-s and very many great sages as well are extolling Indra who is abiding in firmament. [3-5-10b, 11a]"
Aranya Kanda,5,8,"On seeing Indra speaking there to sage Sharabhanga, Rama spoke to Lakshmana. [3-5-11b, 12a]"
Aranya Kanda,5,9,"Rama then on pointing out the chariot expressed his own amazement saying, ""Lakshmana see this wonderful chariot that includes effulgence and auspiciousness as well, and that abides in firmament, and highly luminous like the Sun... [3-5-12b, 13]"
Aranya Kanda,5,14,"""Of which horses we have earlier heard from our teachers telling that they belong to Indra, the Chief Invitee in Vedic rituals, they are these divinely green horses that now abide in the firmament, and definitely these must be Indra's horses..."
Aranya Kanda,5,11,"""And oh, manly-tiger Lakshmana, those that are there in hundreds and hundreds around Indra, those youthful ones with their ear-ornaments and swords in hands, with wide and broad chests, with club shaped arms, and clad in glimmering red garments, all are like tigers, all are unapproachable, all of them are wearing ornamental chains on their chest-place that are akin to flaring fires, and in their appearance, Soumitri, they always bear a look of twenty-five-year-olds...

Aranya Kanda,5,18,"""The age factor of gods remains constant at the age that appears for these nice-looking Tigerly-men, so they say... for gods are immortals and they will be ever young..."
Aranya Kanda,5,19,"""Stay for a moment Lakshmana along with Vaidehi, until I know clearly about that resplendent one on that chariot..."
Aranya Kanda,5,20,On saying to Lakshmana 'stay there only...' Rama proceeded towards the hermitage of Sage Sharabhanga..
Aranya Kanda,5,21,"Then, on seeing Rama arriving there, Indra, bade farewell to Sage Sharabhanga and said this to the celestials attending him."
Aranya Kanda,5,16,"""Here comes that Rama...before he talks to me, you lead him towards his vow, after completing the result of his incarnation, then only he is eligible to see me... Let him be a victorious and accomplished one, then I will see him very soon...for that will happen very soon... A great deed is to be verily performed by him that is highly impossible for others... [3-5-22, 23"
Aranya Kanda,5,24,"Then that Enemy-destroyer Indra adoringly bade farewell to the sage, and travelled to heavens by the chariot with its green horses."
Aranya Kanda,5,25,"On the transit of that Thousand-eyed Indra, Raghava with his adherents [namely Lakshmana and Seetha,] came nearby the Sage Sharabhanga, who is sitting nearby the altar of fire."
Aranya Kanda,5,26,"Touching the feet of that Sage Sharabhanga Rama along with Seetha and Lakshmana, and duly permitted and invited by that Sage Sharabhanga they sat there, as they obtained a shelter."
Aranya Kanda,5,27,"Then, Raghava enquired with sage about the arrival of Indra and Sage Sharabhanga narrated all that to him."
Aranya Kanda,5,28,"""Oh! Rama, that boon-giver Indra wishes to take me to Brahma's abode, which is achieved by me by my arduous ascesis and that which is unattainable for them with their souls unconquered..."

Aranya Kanda,5,32,"Thus said by the Sage Sharabhanga to that Manly-tiger Rama, being the scholar in all the scriptures he spoke this sentence to that sage."
Aranya Kanda,5,33,"""I alone can gain all those worlds, oh! Great Saint, I now seek a place to dwell here in this forest as indicated by you... [Apparent meaning.]"
Aranya Kanda,5,27,"""I will however take all those worlds of yours, for you have waited for me and dedicated whatever you achieved by your penance at my tri-feet, as atithi satkaara, honouring guests - ' leaving 'the doer and doing' attachment, and without desire to enjoy the fruits of works, as a karma phala tyaagi . For now, show me a place to dwell in this forest like an ordinary human being - [Implicit meaning according to Govindaraja.]"
Aranya Kanda,5,28,"""I will win-over all those worlds myself, as Kshatriya-s are not supposed to take any donations; they either have to won by them or acquire them for themselves, just show me a place to dwell - [Maheshvara Tirtha.]"

Aranya Kanda,5,34,"Thus said by Raghava, who is like Indra in strength, that supremely intellectual Sage Sharabhanga again spoke this sentence this way."
Aranya Kanda,5,35,"""Here, oh! Rama, a great resplendent sage named Suteekshna, lives in this forest...a virtuous and a self-disciplined one, and he will do something benignant to you..."

Aranya Kanda,5,40,"The fire burnt down that great soul Sharabhanga from head-hair to body hair and thus his shrunk skin, bones and whatever flesh and blood are there, they are also burnt completely."
Aranya Kanda,5,37,"Those who obtained divine knowledge about this mortal body, and those that cannot practice anuSThaana their daily chores, or with any incapability, and those that have left house as holder, and desiccated, could give up their mortal bodies into fire, waters or falling from mountain peaks."
Aranya Kanda,5,41,"He that Sage Sharabhanga, then reappeared as an youngster in the semblance of Fire, o\n resurrecting from that altar of fire he shone-forth."
Aranya Kanda,5,42,"He that Sage Sharabhanga, transcending the ethereal worlds of fire-worshippers, of saints, of great souls, and also of divinities, has ascended to Brahma's abode."
Aranya Kanda,5,43,"He that meritorious and best Brahman Sharabhanga has seen Brahma in Brahma's abode, and Brahma too, on seeing that Brahman happily spoke to him... ""Welcome..."""
Aranya Kanda,6,1,"On Sage Sharabhanga attaining heaven, groups of sages assembled and approached Rama of Kakutstha dynasty, who is glowing with resplendence."
Aranya Kanda,6,2,"The sages called Vaikahanasa-s, [who are born out of the nails of Prajaapati, the first ruler of mankind,] also Vaalakhilyaa-s, [those born from His hair,] and those from the water of His feet-wash, and those that thrive on drinking rays of sun and moon alone, and those that pound with stones and others who thrive on leaves alone, are those sages..."
Aranya Kanda,6,3,"Some of them use their own teeth to grid the grain they eat, and some who perform ascesis in neck-deep water, and some who sleep with their head resting on their shoulders or on chests without using any kind of bed, and some who do not use any kind of beds either, and some who meditate without any repose sitting in an enclosure without any leg-space."
Aranya Kanda,6,4,"And some sages whose food is water alone, or air alone to some, like that some who meditate staying in sky and some who sleep on bare ground itself."
Aranya Kanda,6,5,"Thus some are dwellers on high-peaked places with their senses controlled, and some are wearers of wet cloths, always reciting name or hymn japa and like that some who meditate with five kinds of fire around them."
Aranya Kanda,6,6,"All have Vedic resplendence and firm yogic control, and they have arrived at the hermitage of Sage Sharabhanga for Rama."
Aranya Kanda,6,7,"Those virtuous sages coming together in groups neared Rama, the best beholder of virtue, and said to that supreme one in virtue."
Aranya Kanda,6,8,"""You are the supreme charioteer born in Ikshvaku dynasty hence you are the protector of earth under your control. As with Indra, the ruler of divinities you are a similar ruler for us."
Aranya Kanda,6,9,"Though born in Ikshvaku dynasty you are the Supreme Charioteer, hence you are the same Supreme Charioteer of this Earth and earthlings too, as with Indra who protects divinities, you are our protector."
Aranya Kanda,6,9,"""You are well renowned in all the three worlds by your repute and valour, and in you abounding are the virtues like truthfulness and devotion to your father, and even righteousness too, is there."
Aranya Kanda,6,10,"""You are the great-souled one, knower of righteousness and a patron of virtue... such as you are, on approaching you we beg to state something for which we may please be excused..."
Aranya Kanda,6,11,"""Oh! , very great a-dharma, wrongness, will occur to that king who takes the sixth part of the country's produce as cess, but does not safeguard his subjects like his own sons..."
Aranya Kanda,6,13,"""A king shall treat all the subjects of kingdom as his own sons, and he shall protect them as though he is ready to save them at the cost of his own lives, and he who will always be endeavouring in that manner will attain permanent renown lasting for many for many years to come, and thereby he attains a prosperous place even in Brahma's abode... [3-6-12, 3]"
Aranya Kanda,6,14,"""He who righteously protects his subjects will get one fourth of the merit of great duty-bound deeds performed by each individual sage, say yajna-s, ascesis, meditation etc. performances."
Aranya Kanda,6,15,"""O, Rama, though you are there as protector for the hermitages, suchlike this one, where the most reverent Brahmans are there numerously, they look as though forsaken, for they are being demolished by demons, devastatingly..."
Aranya Kanda,6,16,"""Come and see many of the bodies of the sages, the contemplative souls, that are variously killed by ghastly demons in the forest..."
Aranya Kanda,6,17,"""At Pampa riverside, and alongside of River Mandakini, and at the surroundings of Mt. Chitrakuta also, this hideous warfare is being done..."
Aranya Kanda,6,18,"""Thus. we are not able to tolerate this injustice to the sages, being executed in this forest by the demons with fiendish deeds, in a ghastly manner..."
Aranya Kanda,6,19,"""Therefore we present ourselves before you as you are our protector, for the purpose of your protecting us that are being killed by nightwalkers... please safe guard us..."
Aranya Kanda,6,20,"""Other than you, oh, valorous Rama, no way-out is deducible on this earth, hence oh, prince, protect all of us from the demons..."
Aranya Kanda,6,21,"On hearing all that is said by the sages of great penance, he that virtue souled Rama said this unto all of the sages."
Aranya Kanda,6,22,"""Unapt is this way of speaking to me...command me, for I am at your behest... just for my personal purpose I had to enter the forests...."
Aranya Kanda,6,23,"""I entered this forest as ordered by my father and even to obliterate the unconscionable state of yours owing to the misdeeds of demons."
Aranya Kanda,6,24,"""Perchance I have come for the achievement of your purpose, such as I am, dwelling in this forest will immensely be fruitful to me..."
Aranya Kanda,6,25,"""I wish to eliminate demons, the enemies of sages, in war... let the sages behold my valour, and my brother's valour in doing so..."" Thus Rama promised the sages."
Aranya Kanda,6,26,"Thus giving his aegis to the sages, that valiant Rama who is firmly virtue-souled, journeyed towards Sage Suteekshna with Lakshmana and the sages, and along with the one given by Honourable Janaka, namely Seetha."
Aranya Kanda,7,1,"Rama, the enemy-scorcher, has gone towards the threshold of the hermitage of Sage Suteekshna along with his brother Lakshmana and Seetha, also along with those Brahmans who accompanied him all the way."
Aranya Kanda,7,2,"He travelling on a long way, and on crossing rivers with plenty of waters has seen a tranquil mountain towering like great Mt. Meru."
Aranya Kanda,7,3,"Then those best ones from Ikshvaku dynasty, those two Raghava-s along with Seetha have entered the forest which will always be full with diverse trees."
Aranya Kanda,7,4,"Entering that perilous forest with its many a flower and fruit bearing trees, they have seen the hermitage in a reclusive place adorned with rows of jute cloths as though garlanding it."
Aranya Kanda,7,5,"There on seeing the ascetically rich Sage Suteekshna sitting in yogic posture with his body bearing lotus-like blotches of soil, Rama dutifully spoke to him."
Aranya Kanda,7,6,"""Oh! godly sage I am Rama, I have come to see you, hence oh, knower of virtue, oh, great sage, oh, one with truthfulness as your courage, please talk to me..."""
Aranya Kanda,7,7,"Then that sage having seen that brave and best proponent of virtue, Rama, embraced him with both of his hands, and spoke this sentence."
Aranya Kanda,7,8,"""Welcome to you Rama, best of Raghu dynasty and the best patron of truth, and when you presently caught this hermitage unprepared this has become a well-lorded one..."
Aranya Kanda,7,9,"""I am awaiting for you only, oh, greatly renowned one, without my ascent to heavens by casting off this body on the earth's plane, oh, brave one, for I have heard that you have arrived at Chitrakuta after you are repudiated from your kingdom..."
Aranya Kanda,7,10,"""The king of gods and the chief invitee in hundred sacrifices Indra approached me, and that great deity said me that I have conquered all the worlds by my meritorious deeds... [3-7-10, 11]"
Aranya Kanda,7,12,"""Let me bequeath those worlds that are cherished by gods and sages alike, but which are won over by me by my ascesis, and you enjoy in them with your wife and with your brother Lakshmana..."
Aranya Kanda,7,13,"That self-respecting Rama replied the radiant sage with intense asceticism, a great soul and an advocate of truth by himself, as Indra would reply to Brahma."
Aranya Kanda,7,14,"""I alone can gain all those worlds, oh, great saint, I now seek a place to dwell here in this forest as indicated by you..."
Aranya Kanda,7,15,"""You are an expert in all affairs, and you are interested in the welfare of all the beings, so said the great souled Sage Sharabhanga of Sage Gautama's dynasty..."" [So said Rama to the sage.]"
Aranya Kanda,7,16,"When said thus by Rama, that great sage with world renown spoke sweet worded sentence with great pleasure."
Aranya Kanda,7,17,"""You can take delight in this good featured hermitage alone, for groups of sages will always be moving here, and this always contains tubers and fruits..."" Thus said Sage Suteekshna."
Aranya Kanda,7,18,"""But herds of very large animals will be coming to this hermitage, they return after scaring us, of course without killing anyone, and they fear none..."
Aranya Kanda,7,18,"""Know that no other problem is there other than the animals..."" So said the sage. On hearing those words of that great sage, that brave elder brother of Lakshmana taking bow and arrow said this sentence. [3-7-19, 20a]"
Aranya Kanda,7,19,"""I will eradicate them, oh, greatly blessed one, those animals that will come collectively in herds with sharp edged, curve-end arrows... [3-7-20b, 21a]"
Aranya Kanda,7,20,"""But you may be more interested in those animals mercifully, then what will be there more painful to you, hence I deem our staying in this hermitage for along will be unbefitting..."" So said Rama. [3-7-21b, 22a]"
Aranya Kanda,7,21,"On saying thus to the sage then Rama came by the twilight, and he paused at it. On worshipping the westward vesperal time, Rama arranged a stay for himself along with Seetha and Lakshmana, there in that delightful hermitage of Sage Suteekshna. [3-7-22b, 23]"
Aranya Kanda,7,23,"Then the great soul Sage Suteekshna on completing his evening rituals and on observing the fall of night he himself courteously served food that is auspicious and worthy of sages to two of the best men, Rama and Lakshmana."
Aranya Kanda,8,1,"Rama along with Soumitri is well revered by Sage Suteekhsna, spent that night there and awoken in the morning."
Aranya Kanda,8,2,Rama got up according to time along with Seetha and touched finely cool water with lotus-fragrance for morning bath.
Aranya Kanda,8,3,"Then they all, Vaidehi, Rama and Lakshmana, on worshipping sacred fire and deities dutifully in the shelter of the sages in that forest and on seeing the dawning sun, they are reft of their blemishes, and then they approached Sage Suteekshna speaking this sentence gently. [3-8-3, 4]"
Aranya Kanda,8,5,"""We stayed here happily, oh, god, venerated by a venerable one like you, and here we come to ask your permission as we wish to journey on, as the sages are hastening us..."
Aranya Kanda,8,6,"""We make haste to see the habitats of hermitages in their entirety, and even wish to see the sages with meritorious selves living in Dandaka forest..."
Aranya Kanda,8,7,"""We wish to have your permission, and that of these eminent sages, who are ever virtuous, self-controlled by their ascesis, and who look like the veritable tongues of sacred fire..."
Aranya Kanda,8,7,"""We wish to proceed before sun attains an intolerable glare, like an unworthy person of unworthy lineage attains wealth in an improper way with much glare..."" saying so Rama with Seetha and Lakshmana venerated at the feet of that sage Suteekshna. [3-8-8, 9]"
Aranya Kanda,8,10,"That eminent sage lifted them that are touching his feet, embraced them tightly, and said this sentence in all his friendliness."
Aranya Kanda,8,11,"""Proceed in an invulnerable way, Rama, along with Lakshmana, and with this Seetha while she follows you closely like a shadow..."
Aranya Kanda,8,2,"""See the pleasant thresholds of the hermitages of the dwellers in the forests of Dandaka, oh! Valiant one, whose souls are consecrated just by their ascesis..."
Aranya Kanda,8,11,"""See the well-flowered woodlands with well-grown fruits and tubers, with herds of best animals and peaceful bird flocks... tranquil waters with spreading clusters of bloomed lotuses and water-birds in the pools and lakes... eye-pleasing rapids from mountains and you can see pleasant forests loaded with the hearty screams of precooks... [3-8-13, 14, 15]"
Aranya Kanda,8,16,"""My dear Rama, you may go and Soumitri you too also may go... but come again towards this hermitage after seeing all of them..."
Aranya Kanda,8,17,"Thus said by the sage, Rama in his turn said to him, ""so be it..."" and having performed circumambulations around the sage he started to journey on."
Aranya Kanda,8,18,Then the broad eyed Seetha gave auspicious quivers and bows to those brothers and then spotless swords too.
Aranya Kanda,8,19,"Both of those two Rama and Lakshmana tied their beautiful quivers well on their backs, and took the twangy bows and exited from that hermitage to go on their way."
Aranya Kanda,8,20,"Those two Raghava-s, the handsome princes, have swiftly set out when permitted by that august sage, wielding bows and swords, and along with Seetha."
Aranya Kanda,9,1,"To Rama, the scion of Raghu and her husband, who started out when permitted by Sage Suteekshna, Vaidehi spoke this with friendly words."
Aranya Kanda,9,2,"""Gross unjust will accrue to any in an abstruse way if his indulgence is enkindled merely by his own desire, and in this world it is possible to fend them off, to have a recourse to justness..."
Aranya Kanda,9,3,"""Only three self-gratifications, the definite products of desire, are there: one is speaking fallacious utterances, which itself is worse, and worst than the other two malefic self-gratifications, where the other two are the fascination for other's wife, and the cruelness without enmity... [3-9-3, 4a]"
Aranya Kanda,9,4,"Hunting, sleeping in daytime, abusing others, indulgence in women, three artistic impulses namely music, dance and drama, wasteful wandering, are the ten desire. Manu smriti."
Aranya Kanda,9,5,"""The habit of telling specious words is not there with you in the past nor it will be there in future, oh, Raghava, then wherefrom the virtue-ruining desire for other's women can be there... [3-9-4b, 5a]"
Aranya Kanda,9,6,"""Oh, king, earlier this vile desire for other's women is absent in you, nor it is there now, unobserved is such a desire in any corner of your heart oh, prince, for you are always interested in your own wife... [3-9-5, 6]"

Aranya Kanda,9,11,"""Only in this respect you have started towards the well-known Dandaka forest along with your brother, and wielding bow and arrows..."
Aranya Kanda,9,12,"""Then on seeing your starting my mind is apprehensively upset, on verily reflecting about your bearing there appears to be no beneficial good for you..."
Aranya Kanda,9,13,"""Oh, brave one, your going towards Dandaka forest is not delightful to me, I tell the cause for that and listen to it as I tell..."
Aranya Kanda,9,14,"""Indeed on entering the forest along with your brother, and wielding bow and arrows, seeing the forest ramblers there, won't you deplete arrows on all of them..."
Aranya Kanda,9,15,"""The bow of warrior and the fuel of a burning fire if available within their reach, they immensely enhance their strength..."
Aranya Kanda,9,16,"""Once upon a time, oh, dextrous one, there was a pious and true worded hermit in some merited forest that was wonted by animals and birds..."
Aranya Kanda,9,17,"""Then Indra came to that hermitage handling a sword, and donning a soldier's guise, to cause hindrance to that hermit's ascesis..."
Aranya Kanda,9,18,"""Indra gave that best sword to store, there in that hermitage to that sage who is lasting in his ascesis, on a redeemable basis..."

Aranya Kanda,9,21,"""Carrying that sword always, that hermit slowly made his own faculty infuriated, loosing determination in ascesis..."
Aranya Kanda,9,22,"""Then with the constant association of that weapon that sage gradually became inadvertent, and smitten by vice he went to hell..."

Aranya Kanda,9,24,"""In affinity and in respect I am reminding but not tutoring you, and in anyway improper is that thought of yours to wield your bow to kill the demons dwelling in Dandaka without any enmity, oh, brave one, undesirable is the killing of offenceless... [3-9-24, 25]"
Aranya Kanda,9,26,"""For the valiant Kshatriya-s who are inclined in forests heartily, the purpose of the bow is this much 'safeguarding the sufferers...'"

Aranya Kanda,9,33,"""I cite all this with my womanly waver, and who is capable to talk to you about dharma? Ponder mindfully along with your brother, and what that is appropriate, you do it...but not belatedly..."
Aranya Kanda,9,33,"This particular chapter is an interesting juncture in Ramayana, where Seetha reminds about the question of triggering cause for Rama's waging a war against demons. Seetha's doubt is well explained in Dharmaakuutam, the encyclopaedic commentary on Ramayana. A number of pages are allotted there for this chapter, and it is said there, that if Seetha is said to be self-contradictory in telling Rama that bow and arrows are a must to Kshatriya-s to protect the helpless when saying 'safeguard the sufferers, then only Kshatriya-s should use their bow..."" as at verse 3-9-26 above, and also questioning immediately at 3-9-27, 'where the Kshatriya dharma, where the hermit's way of living...' etc., dharmaakuutam says not so. She is not contradicting herself in her statements, but asking Rama to have a cause, without resorting to weaponry against those demons, in a straightforward way. ataH tad rakShaNaaya aayudhamna graahyam iti etad abhipraayakatvaat ||"
Aranya Kanda,9,34,"She is inquisitive to know why Rama alone shall raise the bow and arrows against some demons hurting some sages. These sages are having super powers and Indra like celestial chiefs are coming to these sages to take them to heaven with their mortal bodies. Can't they eliminate these demons? But these super hermits are not going to heaven, which is the minimum ambition of any penance, but requesting Rama to protect them from demons. And Rama obligingly started to wage this unilateral war, where any war requires a triggering point. Can't the super sages eliminate these demons, with their powers acquired by their penances? This is the question of Seetha. For this, Rama replies so convincingly in the next chapter, saying that the sages cannot issue forth a curse at the demons, in the course of their penance."
Aranya Kanda,9,35,"Sage Vishvamitra, though being a furious sage, once sought the help of Rama to counter the Demoness Tataka. And Rama rendered it. Now also these sages do not waste their powers at the mischievous demons, but ask Rama to safeguard their interests, for Rama is the king, whether he may be in capital or in forests."
Aranya Kanda,9,36,"Secondly, Rama is subjected to the throne of Ayodhya, now being held by his brother Bharata, and as a loyalist to that throne, Ram should act in accordance with the rules of his kingdom. This area Dandaka forests is under the ambit of their own kingdom. So Rama has to perform the deeds suitable to their kingdom. When killing Vali, Rama speaks to Vali -- ""all this area is under our kingdom, now held by Bharata, and it is my duty to act in accordance with the decree of that throne..."""
Aranya Kanda,9,37,"""Regarding the cause, Seetha's doubt comes true and she alone becomes the ultimate cause for Rama, to wage the final war with Ravana."
Aranya Kanda,10,1,"On hearing all of the words said by Vaidehi, in adoration of her husband, he who abides by virtue alone that Rama replied Janaki."
Aranya Kanda,10,2,"""You have said beneficial, friendlily words that are seemlier to your disposition, oh, lady, which are apt to speak of your familial brought up, for you are the daughter of virtue-knowing Janaka."
Aranya Kanda,10,3,"""What more shall I say, oh, lady, since it is said that 'a warrior handles a bow so that misery's tears cease to flow...' and this saying is iterated even by you..."
Aranya Kanda,10,4,"""Oh! Seetha, those shleterable sages of Dandaka forest have approached me sombrely on their own, and thus they came into my refuge..."
Aranya Kanda,10,5,"""Subsisting on fruits and tubers, living at all the time in forests those sages are not getting quietude, as they are scared by the demons with invidious deeds..."
Aranya Kanda,10,6,"""The sages dwelling in Dandaka forest are being eaten away by fiendish demons that subsist on human flesh, and while being eaten away like that those eminent Brahmans have said to me, ""please come to our rescue..."" [4-10-6,7a]"
Aranya Kanda,10,7,"""This way when I have heard the words voiced by them, I comforted them verbally and avouched this way, ""Be gracious to me... you all... by which reason I am being addressed this way by this kind of eminent Brahmans, whom I should have actually addressed my self, this indeed is a dishonour for me...

Aranya Kanda,10,13,"""Many hurdles are always there in our practice of ascesis, and even the ascesis have become impracticable, oh, Raghava, thus though being eaten away by the demons we are not issuing any curse... [4-10-14b, 15a]"
Aranya Kanda,10,14,"""Thereby, you along with your brother protect us that are being persecuted by the demons dwelling in Dandaka forest as you alone are the protector of ours in these forests...'so said sages to me... [4-10-15b, 16a]"

Aranya Kanda,10,17,"""I may forfeit my life, forgo Lakshmana, or even forsake you but not a promise, that too especially made to Brahmans, and having promised I can never go back... [4-10-18b, 19a]"
Aranya Kanda,10,18,"""By that reason, oh, Seetha, even if I am unasked, safeguarding sages is definitely to be done by me, how then it is undone when given a promise... [4-10-19b, 20a]"
Aranya Kanda,10,19,"""With your friendship and good-heartedness you say these words, oh, Seetha, I am contended... uninterested ones do not forewarn, indeed... [4-10-20b, 21a]"
Aranya Kanda,10,20,"""Appropriate and seemly is your word of caution to your bloodline, oh, graceful Seetha, you are the co-pursuer in dharma with me, hence you are loftier to me than my own lives..."" So said Rama to Seetha. [4-10-21b, c]"
Aranya Kanda,10,22,"That exalted soul Rama on saying those words to Seetha, his dear wife and the daughter of Janaka, wielding his bow proceeded further with Lakshmana to the picturesque woodlands of hermits."
Aranya Kanda,11,1,"Rama travelled ahead while the glorious Seetha in middle, and wielding bow Lakshmana followed them on the rear."
Aranya Kanda,11,2,"They proceeded while seeing diverse mountain terraces, forests, and diversely enchanting rivers too, along with Seetha."
Aranya Kanda,11,3,"Beholding the rivers that have water-birds like saarasa, chakravaaka that move on their sandbanks, and also the lakes that contain lotuses and water born birds, they moved on."
Aranya Kanda,11,4,"The moved on watching spotted deer banded in herds, the wild boars, large horned buffaloes maddened in virility, and the ruttish elephants rending trees like their enemies."
Aranya Kanda,11,5,"On going far on their way, and when the sun is dangling in the western skiy, together they saw a charming lake of one yojana width fully overloaded with red and white lotuses, overspread with sporting elephants, and over-flurried with waterfowls like saarasa birds, kaadamba birds, swans and with others kinds too. [4-11-5, 6]"
Aranya Kanda,11,7,"Out of the tranquil and enchanting waters of that lake audible are the melodies of singing and musical instruments, but none is visible."
Aranya Kanda,11,8,"Then Rama and also Lakshmana, the great charioteer, inquisitively started to ask the Sage named Dharmabhrita about it."
Aranya Kanda,11,9,"""On hearing this greatly amazing music from lake, oh, great saint, intensive inquisitiveness is created in all of us, why this, please tell us clearly about it."" Thus Rama asked."
Aranya Kanda,11,10,Thus said by that Raghava then that virtuous sage quickly started to tell about the efficacy of that lake.
Aranya Kanda,11,11,"""Oh, Rama, this is an all-time lake built by the ascetic power of the sage Mandakarni, known as Five Apsara Lake."
Aranya Kanda,11,12,"""He that great saint Mandakarni practiced rigorous ascesis for ten thousand years staying in the waters of the lake, and consuming air alone."

Aranya Kanda,11,14,"""This sage is praying for someone's place among us,"" thus all of those heaven-dwellers are perturbed at heart."
Aranya Kanda,11,15,"""Then all gods assigned five important Apsara-s, the celestial courtesans, whose shine is like the sprint of the lightning, to effectuate hindrance in that sage's ascesis."
Aranya Kanda,11,15,"Then those five celestial beauties have led that sage astray who discerned the nature of this and the other world, or good and bad, or the nature of Absolute-Soul and Body- bound Soul, towards the passional restraint by, as though to achieve god's task."
Aranya Kanda,11,17,"""Also thus, those five celestial apsara-s attained wifehood of that sage, and for them he built a house in there, concealed inside that lake."

Aranya Kanda,11,20,"That highly renowned Raghava together with his brother acknowledged the sage Dharmabhrita's account, exclaiming it as ""amazing is this..."""
Aranya Kanda,11,20,"While saying thus Raghava has seen a cluster of hermitages nearby, encircled with sacred grass, jute cloths, and even encompassed with Vedic solemness, and he entered that hermitage along with Seetha and Lakshmana. [4-11-21, 22a]"
Aranya Kanda,11,21,"Rama happily stayed in that august cluster of hermitages duly venerated by those great saints for sometime, and then that expert in great missiles Rama went to the hermitages of those sages with whom he stayed earlier, for another round. [4-11-22, 23, 24a]"
Aranya Kanda,11,22,"Rama stayed there for nearly ten months at some place, elsewhere for one year, at somewhere else for four months, and for five, and six months at elsewhere, even at somewhere else for more than a month, and for more than one and half months elsewhere. [4-11-24, 25, 26a]"
Aranya Kanda,11,23,"While Raghava stayed comfortably taking delight in those hermitages of sages, indeed ten years have smoothly elapsed. [4-11-26b, 27a]"
Aranya Kanda,11,24,"Thus that virtue-knowing glorious Rama on going around those hermitages along with Seetha indeed went to the hermitage of Sage Suteekshna again. [4-11-27b, 28a]"
Aranya Kanda,11,25,"On coming at that hermitage that enemy destroyer is adored by sages, and he resided there for some time. [4-11-28b, 29a]"
Aranya Kanda,11,26,"Then on one day while staying in that hermitage Rama submissively said this to that sage Suteekshna who is sitting nearby. [4-11-29b, 30a]"
Aranya Kanda,11,27,"""I have always heard through the narratives narrated by other sages that the godly and eminent sage Agastya is residing in this forest. [4-11-30b, 31a]"
Aranya Kanda,11,28,"""But due to the vastness of this forest I have not known that place, where is the pious hermitage of that astute sage? [4-11-31b, 32a]"
Aranya Kanda,11,29,"""I wish to approach that sage seeking that godly sage's graciousness, along with my brother and Seetha to venerate him. [4-11-32b, 33a]"
Aranya Kanda,11,30,"""Can I personally propitiate that supreme sage -- is my high ambition, and it is recurrent in my heart."" So said Rama to Suteekshna. [4-11-33b, 34a]"
Aranya Kanda,11,31,"Sage Suteekshna on hearing that particular request of that virtue-minded Rama is gladdened and said this to him. [4-11-34b, 35a]"
Aranya Kanda,11,32,"""Oh, Raghava, even I wished to say this to you, that you may approach Agastya along with Lakshmana and Seetha. [4-1-35b, 36a]"
Aranya Kanda,11,33,"""But providentially you alone raised this topic with me, Rama, I will tell you where that great sage Agastya is. [4-11-36b, 37a]"
Aranya Kanda,11,34,"""On your going four yojana-s from this hermitage, oh, dear Rama, there is the great and glorious hermitage of Agastya's brother on the southern side. [4-11-37b, c]"
Aranya Kanda,11,38,"""That hermitage is there on a plateau in a spectacular place of that forest which is adorned with many flowers and fruits, thickets of long pepper, and reechoed with the callings of various birds."
Aranya Kanda,11,36,"""There are diverse lakes that are receptacles for tranquil waters, that are teeming with swans and partridges, beautified with ruddy geese, and Rama staying there for a night you may proceed in the next morning. [4-11-39, 40a]"
Aranya Kanda,11,37,"""On going one yojana beyond, taking the southward course on the side of the forest clump you will find Agastya's hermitage. [4-11-40b, 41a]"
Aranya Kanda,11,38,"""Seetha and Lakshmana will enjoy those woodlands adorned with diverse pleasant trees, as the woodlands abounding with diverse trees will naturally be delightful, isn't it. [4-11-41b, 42]"
Aranya Kanda,11,43,"""If your mind is made up to see that great sage Agastya, oh, great ingenious Rama, resolve your thinking in going only today."" So said Sage Suteekshna to Rama."
Aranya Kanda,11,44,"On listening that which is said by the sage, Rama revered that sage along with his brother, and then he journeyed with Seetha and his follower Lakshmana aiming to reach Agastya."
Aranya Kanda,11,41,"While viewing beautiful forests, cloud-like mountains, lakes, and rivers that are flowing following the pathways, Rama happily journeyed on the pathway indicated by sage Suteekshna, then he gladly spoke this sentence to Lakshmana. [4-11-45, 46]"
Aranya Kanda,11,47,"""Definitely this alone appears to be the hermitage of Sage Agastya's brother, one with great soul and pious deeds."
Aranya Kanda,11,48,"""As how thousands of trees are bowing under the weight of flowers and fruit on the pathway, thereby I perceive it to be the hermitage of Agastya's bother."
Aranya Kanda,11,49,"""Upraised by the wind the sour-smell of pippali fruits is suddenly coming closer from the forest."
Aranya Kanda,11,50,"""Here and there visible are the well heaped heaps of firewood, and all over appearing is the sacred grass snipped at its top and gemlike in its tinge."
Aranya Kanda,11,51,"""From inside the hermitage in the midst of this forest the vertex of smoke from ritual fire is clearly visible as high as the vertex of a black rainy cloud."
Aranya Kanda,11,52,"""On performing bathing in sacred streams the Brahmans are making flower offerings to gods, called puSpa bali, with the flowers that are personally collected by them."
Aranya Kanda,11,53,"""Thus by the words of Sage Suteekshna as I have heard, oh, gentle Lakshmana, this hermitage shall definitely be that of Sage Agastya's brother."
Aranya Kanda,11,54,"""Whose brother is Sage Agastya with meritorious deeds, who wishing well-being of the world controlled death by his efficacy, and who made this southern region a liveable region, this must be the hermitage of such a sage, such Agatya's brother."
Aranya Kanda,11,55,"""Once upon a time verily cruel demon brothers Vaataapi and Ilvala were here together, and they the dreadful demons, they say, used to be Bhraman-killers."
Aranya Kanda,11,56,"""Disguising in Bhraman's semblance and speaking sophisticatedly that Ilvala used to invite Brahmans for the purpose of obsequial ceremonies, where Brahman are fed after usual ceremony to appeases their manes."
Aranya Kanda,11,57,"Then Ilvala used to make his brother Vaataapi into a ram, perfect that ram's meat into deliciously cooked food, and used to feed Brahmans according to obsequial rites and deeds."
Aranya Kanda,11,58,"""When those Brahmans are surfeited with that ram's meat, then Ilvala used to shout loudly, ""oh, Vaataapi, you may come out."""
Aranya Kanda,11,59,"""Then on listening his brother's words Vaataapi used to lunge out bleating like a ram, tearing and rending the bodies of those Brahmans."
Aranya Kanda,11,60,"""This way they the guise changing demons always ruined thousands of Brahmans together, greedy for raw-flesh as they are."
Aranya Kanda,11,61,"""Then by Sage Agastya, whom gods have prayed to end this demonic menace, and whom demon Ilvala invited to feast during obsequial rites, he that Agastya having relished the fiendish demon in the form of ram, they say, had finished him off."
Aranya Kanda,11,62,"""Then Ilvala while giving lateral hand wash into the palms of Agastya entered in the routine conversation of obsequies asking, ""Is this rite fulfilled..."" and he furthered it in calling his brother to come out."
Aranya Kanda,11,63,Then that wise and eminent sage Agastya spoke mockingly to Ilvala who is conversing that way to his brother to come out.
Aranya Kanda,11,64,"""Where is the energy for that ram shaped demon brother of yours to come out as I digested and sent him to the hellish residence of Terminator."
Aranya Kanda,11,65,"""Then on hearing the words of sage Agastya affirming brother's demise, that night-walking demon furiously commenced to assault the sage."
Aranya Kanda,11,66,"""When that demon rushed towards that best Bhraman to kill, he that sage glowing with his own refulgence burnt him down just by his flame-like eyes and doomed him to death."
Aranya Kanda,11,67,"""This hermitage embellishing with lake and woods belongs to the brother of Sage Agastya who has done this impossible deed just by his compassion towards Brahmans."" So said Rama to Lakshmana and Seetha about Agastya."
Aranya Kanda,11,68,While Rama narrated that way to Lakshmana sun went into dusk and the vesperal time came close of him.
Aranya Kanda,11,69,"Worshipping sunset along with brother as per custom, Rama entered that hermitage and greeted that sage."
Aranya Kanda,11,70,Raghava spent one night there when that sage received him well and when they dined on tubers and fruits.
Aranya Kanda,11,71,Raghava spent that night there and when sun rose in solar orbit he took leave of the brother of Sage Agastya saying the following.
Aranya Kanda,11,72,"""Oh, godly sage, we stayed in the night comfortably, I now make an obeisance and bid farewell to you, as I wish to proceed to see your mentor and elder brother Agastya."
Aranya Kanda,11,73,"When the brother of Agastya said, ""you may go,"" Rama the legatee of Raghu journeyed on the pathways as directed by Suteekshna, and on observing those woodlands."
Aranya Kanda,11,74,"On observing the wild grass that grows on its own giving wild grain, Jack-fruit trees, sala trees, Ashoka trees, lemons trees, saplings of bilva trees and also madhuka and bilva trees he journeyed."
Aranya Kanda,11,70,"Rama has seen hundreds of flowered forest trees that are battered by the trunks of elephants, that are adorned with monkeys, reverberated by hundreds of lusty bird folks, and that are enriched by the flowered climbers whorled around them. [4-11-75, 76]"
Aranya Kanda,11,77,Then the lotus-eyed Rama said this to his follower Lakshmana who is a valiant and glory-enriching one and who is near at hand.
Aranya Kanda,11,78,"""As to how the trees are appearing with velvety leaves, and as to how the animals and birds appear unwearied, thus gauging by this it appears that the hermitage of that contemplative soul Agastya is situated not very far from here."
Aranya Kanda,11,79,"""He who by his own deed is renowned in the world as Agastya, the stopper of mountain, it appears to be his hermitage that alleviates the weary of wearied ones."
Aranya Kanda,11,80,"""The forest nearby this hermitage is overrun by huge smoke from altars of fire, overstuffed with the garlands of jute cloth, overcrowded with the herds of peaceful deer, and also overloaded with sonority of the birds."
Aranya Kanda,11,81,"""He who impeding death by his yogic might and wishing well-being for worlds made this southern extent a liveable province by his pious deeds, his hermitage is this."
Aranya Kanda,11,82,"""Under whose influence the demons behold this southern quarter appallingly, and they do not even venture to live here, such a sage Agastya's hermitage is this."
Aranya Kanda,11,83,"""And from when that pious deeded Agastya took possession of this quarter, from then on the night walkers are calmed down and remained without feud."
Aranya Kanda,11,84,"""This very worthy southern quarter is known in the name of that godly saint Agastya and this remained unattackable to the demons with cruel deeds."
Aranya Kanda,11,79,"""Complying which sage's directive Mt. Vindhya ceased to heighten in order not to obstruct the path of the sun, such sage's hermitage is this who is renowned in the world by his deeds and whose longevity is inestimable, hence this glorious hermitage is adored by well-behaved animals and humans as well. [4-11-85, 86]"
Aranya Kanda,11,87,"""He that gentle sage who is always interested in the respect of sagacious ones is thus an esteemed one in the world, and for us when we approach him he accords beneficence."
Aranya Kanda,11,88,"""Oh, adept Lakshmana, I wish to worship that great saint Agastya therein that hermitage, and oh, gentle one, I think of living the remainder of forest living here only."
Aranya Kanda,11,89,"""There gods with gandharva-s, siddha-s, exalted sages will be worshipping Agastya who is self-regulating self-disciplinary."
Aranya Kanda,11,90,"""There no liar can live, nor a savage, nor even a deceiver, nor a man-torturer, nor one with sinful behaviour, for that sage is of that nature."
Aranya Kanda,11,91,"""There the gods, celestials, reptiles, birds live together wishing to worship the Absolute with self-discipline."
Aranya Kanda,11,92,"""There the blest and great souls of accomplished ascesis rode to heavens by aircrafts similar to sun in resplendence, on relinquishing their mortal bodies here and on obtaining new bodies."
Aranya Kanda,11,93,"""There gods will endow the state of celestials or immortals, or many realms of divine living to those auspicious beings that worship them."
Aranya Kanda,11,94,"""We arrived at the threshold of the hermitage, oh, Soumitri, you enter firstly and submit to Sage Agastya about my arrival at this place along with Seetha."
Aranya Kanda,12,1,"On entering the hermitage Lakshmana, the younger brother of Raghava, reached Agastya's disciple and spoke this sentence to him."
Aranya Kanda,12,2,"""A king named Dasharatha was there, his eldest son and the dynamic one, Rama has arrived along with his wife Seetha to see the sage."
Aranya Kanda,12,3,"""I am his loyal, dedicated, and adherent younger brother named Lakshmana, if ever you have heard of us."
Aranya Kanda,12,4,"""Such as we are, we entered the awful forest at the decree of our father, and we wiush to see the godly sage, let this be informed to him."" Said Lakshmana to the disciple of Agastya."
Aranya Kanda,12,5,"On hearing that sentence of Lakshmana that disciple who is ascetically rich replied 'agreed, ' and he entered the sanctum of Ritual-fire to submit the same to Agastya."
Aranya Kanda,12,6,"He that agreeable disciple of sage quickly approached the irrefutable sage by his asceticism, made palm-fold and said this to the eminent sage about about the arrival of Rama, exactly as said by Lakshmana. [3-12-6, 7a]"
Aranya Kanda,12,7,"""Sons of King Dasharatha, Rama and also thus Lakshmana have entered the threshold of hermitage along with the wife of Rama, namely Seetha. [3-12-7b, 8a]"
Aranya Kanda,12,8,"""Those two enemy-destroyers have come cherishing to see and serve you, hence it will be apt of you to order what next is to be done in this regard."" Said disciple to the sage. [3-12-8b, 9a]"
Aranya Kanda,12,9,"Having heard from the disciple that Rama has arrived with Lakshmana and with highly fortunate Seetha the sage said this to him. [3-12-9b, 10a]"
Aranya Kanda,12,10,"""My heart is indeed yearning for his arrival, and after this long a time Rama providentially came to see me."" [3-12-10b, 11a]"
Aranya Kanda,12,11,"""Go forth and make welcome to Rama, Lakshmana and to Seetha, and they be entered here, why you have not invited them as yet? [3-12-11b, 12a]"
Aranya Kanda,12,12,"Thus said by the great-souled sage and the knower of virtue, the disciple adored him with palm-fold saying that ""as you say."" [3-12-12b, 13a]"
Aranya Kanda,12,13,"Then that disciple went out with a little perplexity and said this to Lakshmana, ""Where is this Rama? He may come to see the sage and let him enter hermitage on his own."" Said that disciple to Lakshmana. [3-12-13b, 14a]"
Aranya Kanda,12,14,"Then on going out to the exterior of that hermitage along with that disciple, Lakshmana has shown him Rama and Janaka's daughter Seetha. [3-12-14b, 15a]"
Aranya Kanda,12,15,"While that disciple repeated the obliging words of Agastya entered that reception-worthy Rama into hermitage on receiving him well. [3-12-15b, 16a]"
Aranya Kanda,12,16,"And then Rama entered the hermitage with Seetha and Lakshmana looking over it which is overspread with docile deer. [ 3-12-16b, 17a]"
Aranya Kanda,12,17,"Rama entered inside the hermitage and saw therein the sanctus of Brahma, Fire-god, Vishnu, Indra, Vivasvat - the Sun-god, Soma - the Moon-god, Bhaga - one among the twelve Suns, and the sanctusms of Kubera, [Wealth-Management-god, are seen and passed by the three of them, sanctums of Dhaata, Vidhaata - Vedic deities created by Brahma to help Svayambhuu Manu, santucm of Vaayu - the Air-god, and also like that the sanctum of great-soloed VaruNa - the Rain-god who also wields noose, and the sanctum of Gayatri - the presiding deity of gnosis, sanctum of Vasus - eight of them, and the sanctum of cobra's king - aadi sheSa, the divine Thousand-headed serpent that bears this globe on its head, and on which Vishnu reclines, and even the sanctum of GaruDa - the Divine Eagle and the vehicle of Vishnu, and the half brother of aadi sheSa, and the sanctum of Kaartikeya - chief of gods army, second son of Shiva, and the sanctum of Dharma - Dharmaraaja, presiding deity of Virtue-Vice-Time of living beings, in-charge of the hell.

Aranya Kanda,12,18,"Then encircled by disciples the sage Agastya came out quickly, and Rama saw him who is glowing brilliant before all the other sages. [3-12-21b, 22a]"
Aranya Kanda,12,19,"On seeing the brilliantly glowing sage among those sages, he that bold Rama said this sentence to Lakshmana, the fortifier of fortune, ""Here comes the godly sage, Lakshmana, by his eminence I comprehend him as a depository of all ascesis."" [3-12-22b, 23]"
Aranya Kanda,12,24,"That dexterous Rama on saying about that sun-like radiant sage Agastya, he that descendent of Raghu fell on the feet of Agastya touching them reverentially."
Aranya Kanda,12,25,"Then he who is a delight to the on lookers that noble-hearted Rama on revering the sage along with Lakshmana and Seetha, the princess from Videha, stood aside with his palms adjoined."
Aranya Kanda,12,26,"Offering seat and water that sage received Rama, and even on exchanging pleasantries that sage said to him, ""please be seated."""
Aranya Kanda,12,27,"Having completed his personal worship to Fire-god, and having offered water and other formalities to guest, that sage gave viands to guests according to his hermitic observances."
Aranya Kanda,12,28,"Then that eminent and shrewd sage Agastya in righteousness took his seat at the outset, and spoke to prudent Rama of righteousness itself, and who by now is sitting with his palms adjoined."
Aranya Kanda,12,29,"""Worshipping the fire, giving water and worshipping the guest a hermit should receive a guest and feed him, and if a hermit practices contrarily, oh, Rama, he is destined to eat his own flesh like a false deponent in other world say, hell."
Aranya Kanda,12,30,"""You are the king of all the world, the treader in the path of righteousness, great charioteer of probity, and you are the venerable and estimable one, and you have arrived as my dear guest."
Aranya Kanda,12,31,"Saying thus, Agastya adored Raghava well with fruits, tubers, flowers and others according to his ardency, and then he said this to Rama."
Aranya Kanda,12,28,"""This sacred bow that is decorated with gold and diamonds is crafted by the divine architect Vishvakarma pertains to Vishnu, and these unwasteful arrows equalling sun in their blaze are the gift of Brahma. [3-12-32, 33a]"

Aranya Kanda,12,36,"""The bow, these two quivers, arrows, and the sword, oh, Rama, the endower of grace, receive and wield them to triumph over the demons as Indra would wield Thunderbolt."
Aranya Kanda,12,37,"On saying thus that great resplendent and godly sage Agastya, gave all of those best weapons to Rama, and again spoke to Rama"
Aranya Kanda,13,1,""" I am delighted Rama, safe you be, oh Lakshmana, well-contended I am for you have come to pay respects to me along with Seetha."
Aranya Kanda,13,2,"""The well-worn trail of yours on pathway is strenuousness and painful for you two, and it is evident from the sweat above your necks, even much more for Janaka's daughter, Maithili."
Aranya Kanda,13,3,"""She is delicate and not discomforted by such distresses earlier, yet motivated by her friendship she came to these highly detrimental forests."
Aranya Kanda,13,4,"""In which way Seetha takes delight in these forests, Rama, that you may ensure to her, for she has done an impossible deed in following you to forests, an impossible deed for womenfolk, in general."
Aranya Kanda,13,5,"""From the beginning of creation the nature of women is this way only, oh scion of Raghu, they devote themselves to their men in good fortune, but they leave them off in ill fortune."

Aranya Kanda,13,9,"Thus said by the sage, Raghava spoke amiable this sentence adjoining his palms to the sage who is glowing like a ritual-fire."
Aranya Kanda,13,10,"""I am privileged and blessed as my mentor and the eminent age is well pleased with the virtues of my brother and wife which are non-dissimilar to mine."
Aranya Kanda,13,11,"""But a place with water and many forests may please be shown, where I can reside happily and self-composedly on erecting a hermitage."" Thus Rama asked the Sage Agastya."
Aranya Kanda,13,12,"Then that eminent sage Agastya on contemplating a while about what Rama has said, that virtuous and confident sage spoke more ideational word to Rama."
Aranya Kanda,13,13,"""A most prosperous place called Panchavati is there at a distance of two yojana-s from here, oh, dear Rama, which is abundant with tubers, fruits, water, and many deer."" Thus Agastya started to tell."
Aranya Kanda,13,14,"""On your going there along with Saumitri, and on erecting a hermitage you may take delight in there complying the decreed order of your father."
Aranya Kanda,13,15,"""Indeed all of this episode of yours is known to me, oh, merited one, by the ability of my asceticism, and also by my friendship with Dasharatha."
Aranya Kanda,13,16,"""I am in the know of your heartfelt certitude by my ascesis, thereby I wish to advise you to go to Panchavati, though I said that you may dwell in these ascetic-woods along with me. [3-13-16, 17a]"

Aranya Kanda,13,20,"""Even you, Rama, with your good deportment are capable to safeguard the hermits while residing there."
Aranya Kanda,13,21,"""Oh, brave one, you see this great forest of flower-liquor trees, you have to proceed north of it and advance towards a banyan tree."
Aranya Kanda,13,22,"""Then on climbing up an upland a mountain is seen, that which is also not far away, and that renowned Panchavati is there in an ever-blooming forest in the valley of that mountain."" Said Sage Agastya to Rama."
Aranya Kanda,13,23,"When thus said by Sage Agastya, Rama along with Soumitri venerated and bade farewell to that truth advocator sage Agastya."
Aranya Kanda,13,24,Thus well bidden by Sage Agastya those two Rama and Lakshmana have offered their venerations at the feet of that sage and proceeded to their prospective hermitage at Panchavati along with Seetha.
Aranya Kanda,13,25,"Those princes that are dauntless in war took up their bows and braced up their quivers, and resolutely proceeded to Panchavati on the route apprised by that great sage Agastya."
Aranya Kanda,14,1,Then while proceeding to Panchavati that Rahu's descendent came across a mammoth eagle with marvellous might in midway.
Aranya Kanda,14,2,"On seeing such an eagle in the forest those two highly privileged brothers Rama and Lakshmana questioned it asking, ""Who you are?"" presuming it to be a demon."

Aranya Kanda,14,25,"""And Hari's offspring are lions and sagely/mighty monkeys, while Sharduulii gave birth to baboons and tigers."
Aranya Kanda,14,26,"""Then Maatangi's childrenm are elephants, oh, best one among men, Rama, and Shweta gave birth to eight elephants that are at eight quarters of world, sustaining the world on their head."
Aranya Kanda,14,27,"""Then, oh Rama, Surabhi gave birth to two daughters, one is named as illustrious Rohini, safe you be, and the other is Gandharvi."
Aranya Kanda,14,28,"""Rohini gave birth to cows and other livestock, while Surasa gave birth to Naagaa-s, viz., many headed serpents, while Kadru gave birth to ordinary serpents."
Aranya Kanda,14,29,"""Oh, the best among men Rama, the wife of great-soul Kashyapa, lady Manu procreated humans, Brahman--s, Kshatriya-s, Vyasya-s, and Shudra-s."
Aranya Kanda,14,30,"""The Brahman-s emerged from face, the Kshatriya-s from chest, the Vyasya-s from two thighs, and the Shudra-s from two feet, thus we hear from the scriptures viz., Veda, i.e., Rig Veda Purusha Shuukta."
Aranya Kanda,14,31,"""All the merited fruit-bearing trees are given birth by Anala, and now I will narrate about Vinata, the daughter's daughter of Shukii, and about Kadru, the sister of Surasa."
Aranya Kanda,14,32,"""Kadru gave birth to a thousand-headed serpent who is the bearer of this earth, and Vinata gave birth to two sons namely Garuda and Aruna."
Aranya Kanda,14,33,"""Oh enemy-destroyer Rama, I took birth from that Aruna, the charioteer of Sun, and my elder brother Sampati too, hence know me as Jatayu, the son of Shyenii."

Aranya Kanda,14,35,"Raghava revered Jatayu in his turn by gladly hugging and stood by him with his head bent, and that kind-natured Rama is indeed regardful of the friendship of his father with Jatayu that is repeatedly said by Jatayu."
Aranya Kanda,14,36,"He that Rama took the princess from Mithila Seetha, and proceeded to Panchavati along with that very mighty bird and Lakshmana, as though to incinerate enemies, like fire that burns down grasshoppers."
Aranya Kanda,15,1,"Then on going to Panchavati which is full with many serpents and predators, Rama said to splendidly brilliant Lakshmana."
Aranya Kanda,15,2,"""We arrived at the place as indicated by the sage, oh, gentle Lakshmana, this region with its flowered forests is Panchavati."""
Aranya Kanda,15,3,"""In which place we have to situate our hermitage for our liking, for that cast your sight all over the forest, and indeed you are an expert in such matters."
Aranya Kanda,15,4,"""In which place Vaidehi, likewise you and me too can take delight, where the woodland is scenic and the water is pleasurable, and where a water lake, ritual-firewood, flowers, and the sacred grass are available in proximity, oh, Lakshmana, such a place may be searched out.

Aranya Kanda,15,6,"When thus said by Rama, Lakshmana adjoined his palms and said this sentence to Rama in the presence of Seetha."
Aranya Kanda,15,7,"""I am but a dependent, as long as you are there, may it be for innumerable years, I am your adherent, Rama, therefore you yourself tell me to build hermitage in such and such delightful place."
Aranya Kanda,15,8,"Rama is gladdened by those words of that great resplendent Lakshmana, and he selected a place that comprised of all the attributes."
Aranya Kanda,15,9,On taking Lakshmana's hand by his hand Rama paced that beautiful place intended for the construction of hermitage up and down and spoke to Soumitri this way.
Aranya Kanda,15,10,"""This is an evenly and propitious place surrounded with flowered trees and it is apt of you to erect hermitage here, traditionally."
Aranya Kanda,15,11,"""This pleasing lake is seen here adjacently, beaming forth with its lotuses that are similar to sun in resplendence, and that are scented fragrantly."
Aranya Kanda,15,12,"""This River Godavari is also seen from here, surrounded by blooming trees, spread over with swans, and beautified with kaarandava, and chakravaaka birds, as that contemplated soul sage Agastya had said."
Aranya Kanda,15,12,"""Those soaring mountains are appearing beautiful with many caves, surrounded by flowered trees, flurried by animal herds, sounded by peacocks, and they are neither far-off nor very nearby. [3-15-13, 14]"
Aranya Kanda,15,15,"""Here and there are the golden, silvery and coppery ores on the mountains, and they are shining forth like cow-eye ventilators on walls and also like the superb paintings on elephants."
Aranya Kanda,15,14,"""These mountains are brightening with trees of Saala, Palmyra, Tamaala, Date Palms, Jackfruit and also thus with Punnaagaa.

[3-15-16, 17, 18]"
Aranya Kanda,15,19,"""This place is holy, this is delightful and this is with many animals and birds, hence Soumitri, let us reside here along with this bird Jatayu."" Thus said Rama to Lakshmana."
Aranya Kanda,15,20,"Thus said by Rama to that remover of foe's valour and one with very great might, namely Lakshmana, he briskly erected a hermitage for his brother."
Aranya Kanda,15,17,"Lakshmana built a very spacious straw-cottage there levelling and raising the clay for raised floor of the cottage, strongly pillared with long bamboos, thereupon on those pillars excellent rafters are made, and the branches of Shamii trees are spread out, twined firmly with twines of jute strands, and with the cross-laid bamboos for thatching, and over that blades of Kusha grass and leaves of Kaasha are spread and well over-covered for the roof, and thus that very great mighty Lakshmana made that best and very spacious straw-cottage with a levelled surface for residence of Raghava in the interests of Raghava alone, and it resulted as a feast to the eye. [3-15-21, 22, 23]"
Aranya Kanda,15,24,On his going to River Godavari that noble Lakshmana bathed and on gathering lotuses and fruits he returned to the cottage.
Aranya Kanda,15,25,"Then making flowery offerings and peace-invocations also procedural to gR^iha pravesha , entering a new house,] started to show the constructed hermitage to Rama."
Aranya Kanda,15,26,"On seeing the beautifully constructed hermitage along with Seetha, Rama is highly gladdened in respect that straw-cottage."
Aranya Kanda,15,27,"Then Rama very highly gladdened Rama embraced Lakshmana tightly by both of his hands, and spoke these friendly words to him."
Aranya Kanda,15,28,"""Oh, masterful one, I am very happy about you for you have done a great deed, for that reason I am giving what I have to give to you a hugging."
Aranya Kanda,15,29,"""You are the knower of others feelings, knower of many skills, and the knower of what is right and honest, oh, Lakshmana, such as you are, being with you I deem that my virtue-souled father is not gone and forgotten."
Aranya Kanda,15,30,"On saying thus to Lakshmana, Raghava, the enhancer of magnificence comfortably resided in that province which is with many a fruit."
Aranya Kanda,15,30,"While Seetha and Lakshmana devoted themselves to that righteous Rama, he resided in Panchavati like a Divinity in heavenly world for sometime to come."
Aranya Kanda,16,1,"Pleasant hemantha R^itu , pre-winter season has set in after the passage of sharat R^itu, post-rainy season at Panchavati where the noble souled Rama is staying comfortably."
Aranya Kanda,16,2,On some day when night faded into dawn Rama started for the delightful River Godavari for a bath.
Aranya Kanda,16,3,"His valorous brother Saumitri following him humbly with a handy vessel, along with Seetha, spoke this to Rama."
Aranya Kanda,16,4,"""Adorned by which season the promising year will be bright, oh, pleasant conversationalist, and which season will also be pleasant to you, that hemanta season has set in."
Aranya Kanda,16,5,"""These days the dew is harsh to the bodies of people, earth is overlaid with crops, water is unenjoyable, but fire is delightful."
Aranya Kanda,16,6,"""On appeasing manes with worships during northern solstice and even on performing solstitial rituals in time, the righteous people are becoming free from evils."
Aranya Kanda,16,7,"""Amply fulfilled are the desires of the villagers with the affluence of milch cows and dairy, and the vanquishing kings are make moves for the purposes of their further vanquishes."
Aranya Kanda,16,8,"""While the sun is steadfastly attending the direction of Time-god Yama, namely southern horizon, the northern direction is not brilliant like a woman who lost the vermilion mark on her forehead."
Aranya Kanda,16,9,"""By their very nature Himalayas are the depositories of snow, and presently distanced from the sun they are very obviously snowy true to their name."
Aranya Kanda,16,10,"""By the way of touch the mid days are comfortable and in these days the daytime is very much comfortable for sauntering, thus the sun in daytimes is genial and ungenial are the shades and waters."
Aranya Kanda,16,11,"""Overwhelmed by snow presently the noontimes are with soft sun, with bitter cold, with mists and wintry breezes, and with them the forests too are bleak in their sheen."
Aranya Kanda,16,12,"""Precluded is the reclining under open sky as the nights are led by the Pushya constellation, they will now be with brownish-grey fog and chilly, and prolonged are the lengths of nights whereby the three watches of night will be quickly slipping away."
Aranya Kanda,16,13,"""Transgressed is the destiny of moon by the sun as moon lost the chance of keeping people happy with his lustrousness in these days, thus the lustreless moon remained in a blushing sphere with fog, just like a mirror blinded by the fog of a suspire."
Aranya Kanda,16,14,"""Even on a full moon day the moonlight is unbright blemished by mist, and it is appearing like brightly Seetha becoming swarthy by sun's heat, but not brightly."
Aranya Kanda,16,15,"""The western breeze by itself will be cool to touch, but presently charged with snow it is wafting doubly chilly in the early hours."
Aranya Kanda,16,16,"""Covered with the dew the forests that already covered with crop fields of barley and wheat are beaming forth, together with the callings of waterfowls, at the rise of the sun."
Aranya Kanda,16,17,"""The paddy crops in fields are gleaming forth with golden lustre, and their heads full with grain and a little bent down are shapely like the flowers of date-fruit."
Aranya Kanda,16,18,"""Though he came up long back, and though his beams are spreading around, besieged by snowy mist the sun is appearing as moon."
Aranya Kanda,16,19,"Inappreciable is the warmth of sun in the mornings, but comfortable for touch at noontimes, since the reddish but a little palish sunshine is radiating on earth."
Aranya Kanda,16,20,"""The pasturelands are a little moistened with the fall of dewdrops, but the fields of forest are enlivened by the radiance of tender sun's warmth."
Aranya Kanda,16,21,"""On easily touching very clear and cold water with its very broad trunk that intensely thirsty wild elephant is backing away its trunk for the water is that cold."
Aranya Kanda,16,22,"""These waterfowls that are sitting nearby are not entering into waters like cowards not entering battlefields."
Aranya Kanda,16,23,"""Subdued by snowy darkness, enclosed in misty gloom, and reft of flowers these forest ranges appear like those that are asleep."
Aranya Kanda,16,24,"""Now the rivers are imperceptible as their water is overspread with dewdrops, but their water-birds are perceptible only by their callings, thus making that river perceptible, and such rivers are now glistening with moist sandbanks and shores."
Aranya Kanda,16,25,"""Owing to the fall of snow, further owing to the softness and coldness of sun, the water deep down the wells is generally agreeable for drinking."
Aranya Kanda,16,26,"""Lotus lakes are left alone with stalks of lotuses as their petals are aged and withered, decrepit are the fibrils and carpels, thus impaired by cold they are ungracious in look."
Aranya Kanda,16,27,"""But during this time, oh, manly-tiger, ushered by anguish that virtue souled one Bharata must be practising ascesis in city with adoration to you."
Aranya Kanda,16,28,"""On forsaking kingdom and pride of becoming the king of Ayodhya as well, and varied and various pleasures too, he is in self-denial, and with his food regulated he sleeps on chilly surface of earth."
Aranya Kanda,16,29,"""Even he might always be getting up at this time of the day and proceeding to River Sarayu for a bath surrounded by ministers, definite is that."
Aranya Kanda,16,30,"""But how can he who is brought up in high comfort, a delicate one too, enter the cold-wet waters of River Sarayu, in these small hours."
Aranya Kanda,16,31,"""That lotus-petal eyed one with blue-black complexion is an imposing one with lion-like waist, being the noblest he is knower of dharma thus an advocate of truth, and thus intolerant of ignominy, and as a self-restrained one he talks dearly and sweetly, and he is dextrous and an enemy-destroyer, such as he is, that Bharata on forgoing all of his various pleasures he is devoted to you, as you alone are his adorable brother. [4-16-31, 32]"
Aranya Kanda,16,33,"""Even though you are in forests far away from him, he is following you in the practise of austerities, and such a brother of yours, that great-souled Bharata has refused ascent to heaven."
Aranya Kanda,16,34,""" Humans do not derive father's attitude but they take of their mothers' is the well-know maxim in the world, but Bharata rendered it otherwise."
Aranya Kanda,16,35,"""Whose husband is Dasharatha and whose son is gentle Bharata, how then can she, our mother Kaikeyi, is with this sort of cruel disposition, indeed "" Thus Lakshmana spoke to Rama on their way to River Godavari."
Aranya Kanda,16,36,"When that upright Lakshmana is speaking those words that way out of his fondness towards Rama, Raghava spoke to Lakshmana, intolerant of that slanderous talk about their mother."
Aranya Kanda,16,37,"""In any way, dear Lakshmana, you are not supposed to deplore another mother of ours, but you go on telling the topics of Bharata, the king of Ikshvaku-s."
Aranya Kanda,16,38,"""My mind is indeed set to dwell only in forest, and it is firmly avowed, but while yearning for Bharata's fellowship my fascination to reunite with him is recurring again."
Aranya Kanda,16,39,"""I reminisce his words well, that are genial, sweet, heartily, ambrosial and that will gladden the heart."
Aranya Kanda,16,40,"""When can I really reunite, oh, Lakshmana, with great-souled Bharata, valorous Shatrughna, and with you and Seetha."" Thus said Rama to Lakshmana."
Aranya Kanda,16,41,"Thus worrying that way while proceeding, there Rama reached River Godavari and performed bathing with his younger brother Lakshmana and along with Seetha."
Aranya Kanda,16,42,Then on offering water oblations to manes and gods that impeccant trinity extolled the rising sun and gods likewise.
Aranya Kanda,16,43,"On taking bath in the river along with Seetha and Lakshmana, Rama shone forth like All-controlling god Rudra, who will be radiant on taking bath along with his consort Paarvati and with his follower Nandi, the Holy Bull."
Aranya Kanda,16,43,"The portrayal of seasons in epics with all their delicacies is a disputed topic. Ramayana also deals much on these descriptions of seasons. Whether an epic avowed to reflect the Vedic import, as said at 1-4-6, vedopabR^ihmaNaarthaaya , and that which is pious and merited puNyam vedaischa samamatam at 1-1-98, should have accounts on seasons is the question. For this is said that relating niceties of season time and again, is in perfect accord with Veda, for the season and time are subservient to all Veda-s as per the ancillary of Veda, the Astrology, veda-anga : jyotiShya . Veda-s themselves say that the year is the soul of the horse of Ashvameda. uShaa vaa ashvasya medhasya shiraH | sa~Nvatsara aatmaashvasya medhasya | -- yajurveda bR^ihadaaraNyaka Hence time and season are the mind and soul of all Veda-s."
Aranya Kanda,16,44,"Like this we find beautification of four seasons at four places, for e.g., hemanta spring is narrated in starting of Kishkindha. And vasanta post autumnal season is described in Kishkindha 43rd chapter, when Hanuma and others are in search for Seetha, and after their exit from the cave of Swayamprabha. varSa rainy season is portrayed in 28th chapter of Kishkindha. At every possible occasion, all the rituals, daily routines that are time oriented, do explain the importance of time than the importance of ritual or daily routine. It is said: vedopabR^ihmaNaartham pravR^itte asmin granthe veda vihita karma apekShita kaala visheSha nirNaayakatvaat kaala saadhaaraNa lakShaNa pratipaadanam eva tat tat R^itu varNana vyaajena kR^itam iti dharmopayoga sambhavaat | -- saayam kaalaadi cihna pratipaadanam iti etat sarvam karma anuShTaana upayukta kaala j~naapanaartham eva kR^itam iti dharma paryavasaanam sambhavati eva -- dharmaakuutam"
Aranya Kanda,16,45,"Thus dharma is upheld in all these narratives about the season and time, which aspect is upheld by the commentators and they too comment lengthily whenever a season or time factor occurs."
Aranya Kanda,16,46,"Thus, this is the 16th chapter in Aranya Kanmda of Valmiki Ramayana,the First Epic poem of India."
Aranya Kanda,17,1,"On taking bath Rama with Seetha and Soumitri, then went to his own hermitage from that bank of River Godavari."
Aranya Kanda,17,2,Nearing that hermitage Raghava along with Lakshmana performed early morning rituals and then reached the cottage.
Aranya Kanda,17,3,"There Rama comfortably spent time while being adored by eminent sages when he is with them, and narrating many a narrative while sitting in hermitage along with Seetha and his brother Lakshmana, thus he shone forth like the moon when with Chitra constellation. [3-1-7-3, 4]"
Aranya Kanda,17,5,"At one time when Rama is sitting in hermitage and heartily absorbed in telling narratives some demoness arrived at that place, fortuitously."
Aranya Kanda,17,6,"She is but the sister of ten-faced demon Ravana, Shuurpanakha by her name and she has seen him on reaching the paradisiacal being like Rama."
Aranya Kanda,17,6,"He whose face is radiant, arms lengthy, eyes large like lotus petals, stride like that of an elephant, wearing bunches of hair-tufts, delicate yet greatly vigorous, possessor of all kingly aspects, complexion deep-blue like blue lotus, similar to Love-god in brilliance and in simile to Indra, the demoness has seen such a Rama and became lovesick. [3-17-7, 8, 9a]"
Aranya Kanda,17,7,"She that demoness who is facially unpleasant one with that pleasant faced one, pot bellied one with the slim-waisted one, wry-eyed one with the broad-eyed one, coppery-haired one with the neatly tressed one, ugly featured one with the charming featured one, brassy voiced one with the gentle voiced one, deplorably oldish one with the youngish one, crooked talker with the pleasant talker, ill-mannered one with the well-mannered one, uncouth one with couth, abominable one with amiable Rama spoke, besieged by Love-god. [3-17-9b, 11, 12a]"
Aranya Kanda,17,8,"""You are an ascetic yet with a wife, handling bow and arrows yet in the appearance of a sage what for you have come to this province frequented by demons it will be apt of you to tell the purpose of your coming here, in actuality "" [3-17-12b, 13]"
Aranya Kanda,17,14,"Thus asked by demoness Shuurpanakha that enemy-scorcher Rama started to inform all about it, straightforwardly."
Aranya Kanda,17,15,"""A king named Dasharatha was there with his godlike valour, I am his eldest son, and people hear of me by name Rama."
Aranya Kanda,17,16,"""He is Lakshmana by his name, my younger brother and a devoted follower of mine, and she is my wife, daughter of Videha's king, well-known as Seetha."
Aranya Kanda,17,17,"""Desiring to implement the probity in following father's orders and for the sake of establishing probity in living an ascetic's life I have come here to forests to dwell, as enjoined by the directives of the king and my father, and by my mother, as well."
Aranya Kanda,17,18,"""I too wish to know about you. Whose wife are you? What is your name? Or, whose daughter are you? By the way, you are with a most enthralling personality, and then you must be a demoness."
Aranya Kanda,17,19,"""What for you have come, either, you tell in actuality..."" Thus Rama asked her. On hearing the words of Rama she that demoness wetted with love said these words."
Aranya Kanda,17,15,"""I will tell you truth, Rama, nothing but truth, I am a guise-changing demoness named Shuurpanakha, and I will be freely moving in this forest in a solitary manner and unnerving all. [3-17-20, 21a]"
Aranya Kanda,17,16,"""My brother is valorous and mighty Ravana, the king of demons and the son of Vishravasa, if ever you have heard of him. [3-17-21b, 22a]"
Aranya Kanda,17,17,"""And the mighty Kumbhakarna who will always be in profound sleep is my brother, and the virtue-souled Vibheeshana too is my brother, but he does not behave like a demon, and two more bothers of mine are Khara and Duushana who are renowned for their bravery in war. [3-17-22b, 23"
Aranya Kanda,17,24,"""I can excel all of them by my bravery, oh, Rama, and on seeing you for the first time I had a notion that you being the choicest among men you alone are my husband, hence I neared you."
Aranya Kanda,17,25,"""I am endowed with such preponderances and I can operate with my independent might, as such you become my everlasting husband by the way, what can you bring off with Seetha."
Aranya Kanda,17,26,"""Unlovely and unshapely is this one, such as she is, this Seetha is unworthy to be your wife, and I am the lone one worthy to be your wife, hence treat me as your wife."
Aranya Kanda,17,21,"""Shall I eat up this disfigured, dishonest, diabolical human female with a hallow stomach along with him, that brother of yours to make you free."
Aranya Kanda,17,28,"""Afterwards, you can lustily ramble about Dandaka forest along with me while enjoying yourself on various mountaintops in the sky and in forests on the earth."" So Shuurpanakha said to Rama."
Aranya Kanda,17,29,When he is said that way Rama chuckled and that wordsmith started to reply her who eyes are besotted in lovesickness with this sentence.
Aranya Kanda,18,1,"Rama then voicing clearly and softly spoke to her, whom the noose of lust has tethered down, with a smile preceding his words."
Aranya Kanda,18,2,"""Oh, honourable one, I am married and this is my dear wife, thus it will be distressing for your sort of females to live with a co-wife."
Aranya Kanda,18,3,"""He is my younger brother named Lakshmana, he is with a good conduct, good looking, a promising and valiant one, and he is without a wife."
Aranya Kanda,18,4,"""He is without a wife and in need of a wife he is youthful, good-looking and he can become a fitly husband of yours, fit enough to your kind of features."
Aranya Kanda,18,5,"""You woo him, oh, board-eyed [bulged-eyed] one, this brother of mine as your husband like sunshine seeking the Mt. Meru, then oh, great-waisted [pot-bellied] one, you will be without a co-wife "" So said Rama to that demoness."
Aranya Kanda,18,6,"When Rama clearly told that way to that demoness dazed in lust, discarding Rama quickly then she spoke to Lakshmana."
Aranya Kanda,18,7,"""I with my best complexion will be your deserving wife meetly to you charm, you can happily take a jaunt all over Dandaka forest along with me."" So Shuurpanakha ran after Lakshmana."
Aranya Kanda,18,8,"Thus said by the demoness that meaningful sentence maker Lakshmana, the son of Sumitra, then smiled and appropriately replied Shuurpanakha."
Aranya Kanda,18,9,"""How you wish to become a female servant, oh, [black] lotus-coloured one, by becoming the wife of a servant like me? I am just a vassal of my adorable brother."
Aranya Kanda,18,10,"""Oh, goggle eyed one, befitting to your complexion that is un-stainable further you better become the wife of my brother Rama who is abounding in means, and on becoming the younger wife of that adorable one, you too will achieve your means and thus you will be happy."
Aranya Kanda,18,11,"""On discarding her who is disfigured, dishonest, diabolically deleterious old wife with a hallow stomach that Rama will adore you alone."
Aranya Kanda,18,12,"""Oh, best complexioned one with best waist, is there any wiseacre to simply discard your kind of best personality, indeed, in preference to human females?"" Lakshmana said so to Shuurpanakha."
Aranya Kanda,18,13,"Thus said by Lakshmana that despicable one with slouching stomach Shuurpanakha presumed those words to be truthful, for she is equivocal of that equivoque."
Aranya Kanda,18,14,She who is fuddle by lust said to that unassailable enemy scorcher Rama who is sitting in the cottage along with Seetha.
Aranya Kanda,18,15,"""Tenacious of her who is disfigured, dishonest, diabolical, hallow-stomached old wife of yours you are not regarding me high."
Aranya Kanda,18,16,"""Now I wish to eat up this human female right before your very eyes, and then I can blithely make merry along with you, without the botheration of a co-wife."" Said Shuurpanakha to Rama."
Aranya Kanda,18,17,"Speaking that way she that torch-eyed Shuurpanakha dashed towards the deer-eyed Seetha in high exasperation as a great meteor would dash towards Rohini, the brightest star in the sky."
Aranya Kanda,18,18,By that the great-energetic Rama took umbrage and checking her who is like the noose of death swooping down on Seetha said to Lakshmana.
Aranya Kanda,18,19,"""Punning in any way with the base and brutish is inapposite, oh, gentle Saumitri, mark note of Vaidehi, somehow surviving"
Aranya Kanda,18,20,"""She is freakish, knavish and overtly ruttish, oh, tigerly man, it will be apt of you to deface this paunchy demoness "" Thus Rama said to Lakshmana."
Aranya Kanda,18,21,Thus said to that mighty Lakshmana he infuriately drew sword and chopped off her ears and nose before the very eyes of Rama.
Aranya Kanda,18,22,"On hewing off her ears and nose she that ghastly Shuurpanakha blared highly and discordantly, and very speedily fled into forest as she came."
Aranya Kanda,18,23,She that very ghastly demoness when defaced is wetted by blood and blared many a blare like a cloud in cloudburst.
Aranya Kanda,18,24,She that gruesome one in her appearance clasped herself and thunderously entered similarly gruesome forest while her blood fountained and profusely exuded.
Aranya Kanda,18,25,"Then she who is deformed neared her brother Khara who possess violent vigour, who is abiding in Janasthaana and who is presently surrounded by his band of his hench-demons, and before him she that Shuurpanakha fell onto ground like a thunderbolt from the sky."
Aranya Kanda,18,26,"Then that sister of Khara who is convulsed in the fluster of fear and her body wetted with blood reported to her brother Khara, all about Rama's arrival in forest with his wife and Lakshmana, and even about his misshaping her."
Aranya Kanda,19,1,"On seeing her who fell before him in a misshapen and blood-soaked condition, demon Khara is all stewed up and asked her."
Aranya Kanda,19,2,"""Rise up, first tell me clearly putting away your flurry and fluster, who disfigured your form in this way."
Aranya Kanda,19,3,"""Who for sport is poking his fingertip at a venomously fanged black-cobra that has chanced in his close proximity but slouching down inoffensively."
Aranya Kanda,19,4,"""Who on harrowing you is now heedless about his gulping a deadly poison, or about his foolish bracing the noose of Time around his own neck."
Aranya Kanda,19,5,"""You are gifted with boldness and braveness, a whimsical rover, a guise changer by your wish, a coequal of Terminator, but to whom you have gone and by whom you are led into this kind of plight."
Aranya Kanda,19,6,"""Who is that kind of highly intrepid warper, either from gods, or from celestials or from high-souled sages who indeed rendered you shapeless."
Aranya Kanda,19,7,"""Indeed, I do not find anyone who causes displeasure to me in this world, even among divinities including the thousand eyed Indra, the controller of demon Paaka."
Aranya Kanda,19,8,"""Now, I will take away the lives of that miscreant with my arrows that are terminators of lives, as a swan would drink milk to dregs even if it is mingled in water, duly separating milk from water."
Aranya Kanda,19,9,"""Whose frothy blood is it that the earth wishes to quaff when I cut off his crucial organs by my arrows and drop him dead in a combat."
Aranya Kanda,19,10,"""Whose body is it from which birds pressing round gladly wish to wring flesh to pieces for eating when I slay him in war."
Aranya Kanda,19,11,"""Now, when I haul him easily on the ground in a battle that villain will be unredeemable either by gods, celestials, evil spirits, or by demons."
Aranya Kanda,19,12,"""It will be apt of you to gather your sensitivity slowly and tell me as to which miscreant attacked and worsted you in the forest."" Thus Khara spoke to Shuurpanakha."
Aranya Kanda,19,13,"On hearing this kind of words of her brother, especially who is rancorous, then Shuurpanakha spoke these words, tearfully."
Aranya Kanda,19,14,"""Those two are in adulthood, good-looking, gentle yet greatly mighty, eyes broad like lotuses, dressed in jute-cloths and deerskin, subsistent on fruits and tubers, composed, sagacious and celibate, and they are the sons of Dasharatha, namely Rama and Lakshmana. [3-19-14,15]"
Aranya Kanda,19,15,"taruNau ruupa sampannau Though they scarred her on her nose and ears she did not loose her heart for them. This taruNau ruupa sampannau is in accordance with Rama's aspect which will be sadaiva priya darshanaH 'the same pleasant persona at any time' as in Bala Kanda at 1-1-16, as said by Sage Narada to Valmiki. This is the same situation with Hanuma when Seetha asks him to indicate some aspects of Rama so as to believe Hanuma. There Hanuma starts with raamaH kamala patra akshaH sarva sattva manoharaH - sundara 35-8. 'Rama is lotus-petal eyed one' Further people in sleep, intoxicated or infuriated conditions, will speak their heart supramatta kupitaanaam bhaava j~naanam dR^iSTaH So Shuurpanakha who is also in a sleep like daze, she came out with her soulful feelings about Rama."
Aranya Kanda,19,16,This narration has threefold meaning. 1] Through the eyes of a lustful female; 2] To belittle Rama and Lakshmana's prowess only to extol Kara's pride; 3] To deride Khara's valour so that he gets incited to fight Rama and Lakshmana.
Aranya Kanda,19,17,"taruNau 'came of age.' kanyaam varayate ruupam Women's first criterion towards a man is age. But this wording is in dwivacana 'in duel number' so it belongs to both Rama and Lakshmana. Then the question comes 'is she leaning towards both of them?' Yes. She makes eyes at both. First she approached Rama, but he advised her to approach Lakshmana. Lakshmana in turn advises her to approach Rama, thus she got interest in both. This is as per anyonya sadR^ishau viirau 'those darers are similar to one another.' Rama and Lakshmana may be different among themselves, but to the onlookers they appear as one reality. Further, she has hate-thinking for both of them also. She says that 'this situation occurred due to both of them' as at 3-19-18. How can she fall after both at a time? She can, with 'either-or-single-or-both' syndrome because she is a demoness, and unseen are such brothers with their glorious aspects, so far by her."
Aranya Kanda,19,18,"ruupa sampannau 'their aspects are ravishing' The syndrome is that angaat angaat sambhavasi 'offshoots derive parent's aspects.' So Manmatha, the Love-God derived all his aspects from Vishnu. Then it is imaginable how much more that Vishnu might be in his lovely aspect. So Rama is with niratishaya ruupa samR^iddhi 'sublime features, endowed with' that which can be borrowed even by Manmatha."
Aranya Kanda,19,19,"sukumaarau 'delicate' like flowers. Rama is said to equal a delicate flower. asiita puSpa samkaasham Rama's body itself is a flower that which can be cherished by all. Or su = excellent; ku =of earth; maarau = Manmatha-s' 'two Manmatha-s on earth' Manmatha, is only one god of love and without any form or body parts, but these two are having excellent forms and are evident on earth before eyes as per the attribute of kandarpa iva muurtimaan 'he has a form like that of Love-god'"
Aranya Kanda,19,20,"Then her bother Khara may ask 'then why we demons shall hanker after some flimsy, fragile, feeble creatures?' For that she says mahaa balau 'greatly vigorous.' They have un-depleting vigour of manhood, which is what required by an aged demoness."
Aranya Kanda,19,21,"puNDariika vishaala akshau 'white-lotus, broad, eyed' 'Their eyes are not like ours while our eyes are samrakta nayanaa ghoraa 'bloodshot eyes of terrible look'"
Aranya Kanda,19,22,"Or, unlike tamo guNa udreka 'ever persisting with stolid constituent of nature' and unlike rajo guNodreka 'ever energetic with sprightly constituent of nature' -- their eyes are sattva guNa sampanna 'serene with the pure constituent of nature' Though Rama says that he aatmaanaam maanuSyam manye 'in my soul I consider I am human' but as per shruti / scripture, yathaakapyaasam puNDariikam evam akshiNii 'though his outward aspect is hiding his real Being, his eyes are telling the truth of His supernal nature', hence Rama is other-worldly."
Aranya Kanda,19,23,"Or his white broad eyes are comparable with kshiira samudra Milky-ocean, his abode, with its unfathomable depths, so is his heart."
Aranya Kanda,19,24,"Or mahaa balau puNDariika vishaala akshau 'Great mighty and white broad eyed ones' who by their great might annihilate vice and if the evildoer submits himself, their white eyes alone give salvation with a broad-mind. sukumaarau puNDariika vishaala akshau 'Manmatha-like, white, broad eyed'"
Aranya Kanda,19,25,"If it is said that these two are Love-gods on earth, then it may be asked 'where are the flowery arrows of that Love-god to these two?' But the arrows of these earthly Love-gods are their eyes and glances. The lotus is but one among the five arrows of Manmatha. Even Seetha under her direly distressed situation in Lanka says that 'gods, celestials, great-souls et al are sanctified with the look of this lotus-petal eyed one' dhanyaa devaaH sa gandhavaaH siddhaaH ca paramarSyaH | mama pashyanti ye naadhama raamam raajiiva locanam || sundara 26-41. This verse takes its place in gayatri ramayaNa as its 14th verse out of total 27 verses."
Aranya Kanda,19,26,"Further they are excelling only by their nature but not by their dressings and outfits for they are just clad in ciira kR^ishNa ajina dharau 'jute-cloths, deerskin wearers of' Mahaakavi Kalidasa says in his abhij~naana shaakuntalam: says iyam [shakuntala] adhika manoj~naa valkalena api tanvii that, 'this Shakuntala is pleasant though clad in jute-cloths' kimavahi madhuraaNaam maNDananam na akR^itiinaam 'nothing can beautify beautiful people' etc. Though not adorned by any extra special ornamentation they by their nature are attractive, as discerned by sages at 3-1-13 of Aranya Kanda ruupa samhanam lakshmiim saukumaarya suveSatam as well by this Shuurpanakha or even by Ravana in part II of Yuddha Kanda, in 99th chapter 12th verse, who also extols these lotus eyes and the aspect of Rama on his first sight at Rama as padma patra vishaala aksham diirgha baahum arindamam"
Aranya Kanda,19,27,"Should Khara ask in fear 'who is that great-mighty one who mutilated a sister of a great demon like me? Thereby my fear is growing about my own existence.' Then Shuurpanakha's reply is like this, in order to remove Khara's fear of Rama:"
Aranya Kanda,19,28,"taruNau 'youngsters, boys' for his own father Dasharatha tells Vishvamitra that these are uuna Sodasha varshau; na yuddha yogyatam asya apashyaami in Bala Kanda. Shuurpanakha that way tells Khara 'brother Khara... these two Rama and Lakshmana are boyish you need not care them, ' Further yauvane viSayaisiNaam 'boys in young age bother more for enjoymentÃ¯ -- they are bothered to enjoy life and are not yet fit for a war, so you can war with them'"
Aranya Kanda,19,29,"ruupa sampannau 'just by getups they are brilliant, but lack in courage to confront you' kanyaa kaamayet ruupam 'girls cherish charming ones' 'They fall after girls only with their charming aspects that are unworthy to withstand war, so you can war with them'"
Aranya Kanda,19,30,"sukumaarau 'delicate or fragile, or flimsy,' because they are sons of some king, grown up in palace chambers, unlike us who grow in ravines; and they eat nonsensically delectable food, unlike us who happily eat raw-flesh. So, wherefrom they can tolerate your bloodshot glances, let alone your arrows...'"
Aranya Kanda,19,31,"mahaa.abalu = mahaa + a + balau 'very, without, strength; very weak fellows';"
Aranya Kanda,19,32,"furthermore mahaa abalau; mahatii rakshaNiiyaa abalaa yayostu 'a lady, namely Seetha, is to be protected by them. She has become a string fastened around their necks. Then how do they, the sentinels of a woman, can fight you...'"
Aranya Kanda,19,33,"puNDariika vishalaa akshau 'paled, broadened, eyed' 'Their eyes paled and wide-open awaiting the results of their scarring my nose and ears, and their eyes popped up in daze, then what can they do to you...'"
Aranya Kanda,19,34,"Then Khara may ask, ""it is good you have said that they are hapless etc., but they may now muster up some army and fight me back then what?'"
Aranya Kanda,19,35,"For this she says, ciira kR^ishNa ajina dharau 'wearers of jute-cloths and deerskin' And furthering her argument she says, 'how can they afford an army for they themselves have nothing special to wear. That too one of those items, namely the jute-cloth, is begged from a tree that is sessile, and the other, the deerskin, is begged from a deer, that is mobile. They themselves are shuttling in between mobile and sessile how can they confront you.'"
Aranya Kanda,19,36,"Further, this god, say this Rama, has no other special work or duty, except shuttling between mobile or sessile beings or matter, begging their produce, and beg them to recognise him."
Aranya Kanda,19,37,Her words also extol the capabilities of Rama and Lakshmana in warring and said to have addressed Khara this way in order to enhance his self-pride.
Aranya Kanda,19,38,"tarunau; yauvane vijigiisuNaam 'youthful ones are interested in triumphs' 'Because they are the seekers of triumphs, they will definitely triumph over you, you better do not go there and get defeated'"

'for glory [Rama is] the only resort.' 'So many praises are said about them and hence they fight you out, better do not go'"
Aranya Kanda,19,40,"If Khara asks, 'how can they fight me, such a mighty one?'"
Aranya Kanda,19,41,"For this she says, sukumaarau 'they are dextrous' 'with their dexterity they easily eliminate you'"
Aranya Kanda,19,42,"mahaa balau 'greatly mighty' 'Rama is mightily by his shoulder-strength' and also by the use of mahat shabda his might is by his tenacity of mind and ideation to eliminate foes. Or mahaa balau 'greatly sturdy.' Though he wars for a long his vigour does not deplete for he uses two vidya-s: bala, atibala 'by the twin principles taught by Vishvamitra his strength does not deplete."
Aranya Kanda,19,43,"puNDariika vishaala akshau 'white-lotus, broad, eyed' His broad white-lotus like eyes does neither contract in anger nor expand in exclamation, as usually happen to anyone who sees an object of interest with unnecessary widening of eyes priiti visphaarita iikshaNam"

Further they also have arrows and knives with which I am scarred so better not to go there and get your throat slit like my nose and ears, for you are a shameless, incapable demon still sitting here as I go on narrating the incident like a story'"
Aranya Kanda,19,16,"""Having all the aspects of kings they equal the kings of gandharva celestials, and I am ill-disposed to differentiate whether they two are gods or demons."
Aranya Kanda,19,17,""" I have seen a curvaceous lady between those two, a ripely beauty, rich in comeliness, adorned with lots of ornaments."
Aranya Kanda,19,18,"""Owing to that woman I am led into this sort of situation, together by those two, as with an insecure female."
Aranya Kanda,19,19,"""Staying in the van of war I wish to drink the frothy blood of that guileful Seetha along with that of those two, Rama and Lakshmana, when they are killed in war."
Aranya Kanda,19,20,"""I shall drink her blood and also that of those two in war, this being my prime longing let it be fulfilled by you."" Thus wailed Shuurpanakha before her brother Khara."
Aranya Kanda,19,21,While she is saying like that Khara vengefully summoned fourteen great mighty demons that are similar to the Terminator.
Aranya Kanda,19,22,"""Wielding weapons and wearing jute-cloths and deerskin two humans have got into ghastly forest of Dandaka along with a woman of age."" Thus Khara is ordering the fourteen demons."
Aranya Kanda,19,23,"""You shall return to me only on killing those two and also that treacherous woman, and their blood this sister of mine will drink."
Aranya Kanda,19,24,"""Oh, demons, on going there swiftly stamp them out by you own vigour, thus let the fanciful hearty desire of my sister be achieved."
Aranya Kanda,19,25,"""On seeing your finishing those two brothers flatly in a war she this sister of mine will be gladdened, and then she drinks their blood in war, amusingly."
Aranya Kanda,19,26,"In this way when Khara ordered those fourteen demons, they have gone to Panchavati along with Shuurpanakha like black-clouds glided by gales."
Aranya Kanda,19,27,"But then, though the nightwalker wielding sharp arrows have become ineffectual to trounce Rama like the wild elephants which will become ineffectual to overcome the blazingly uprising wildfire."
Aranya Kanda,19,57,"Maheshvara Tiirtha notes that God Shiva cursed Khara and pardoned saying that he will be released from curse by Rama of Dasharatha. tasmaadyaH kruura ruupeNa dehena harataa amR^itam | viShNur daasharathir bhuutvaa mokShayiShyati suvrata | In the sheSa dharma of Maha Bharata in the discourse between Bhiishma and Yudhistira it is said that sage Yajnavalkya has three sons. They are Chandrakanta, Mahaamedha and Vijaya. These three Brahmans became Khara, Duushana, and Trishira by the curse of Shiva. The first one Chandrakanta is Khara. And the disciples of the three Brahman scholars are fourteen and they also became Brahma-demons, who are now being sent. On listening Shuurpanakha Khara came to know that Vishnu arrived in the form of Rama and thus Khara wanted to get release from the curse by Rama, and hence firstly he sends the fourteen demon-disciples, and later he and his brother also follow the suit."
Aranya Kanda,20,1,"Then on arriving at Raghava's hermitage that ghastly Shuurpanakha has shown the brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, along with Seetha to the fourteen demons."
Aranya Kanda,20,2,They have seen the great-mighty Rama seated in the thatched cottage along with Seetha and Lakshmana attending to him.
Aranya Kanda,20,3,"On seeing the arrival of the demons, and the demoness Shuurpanakha too, that magnificent Rama of Raghava dynasty said to the radiantly brilliant Lakshmana."
Aranya Kanda,20,4,"""Oh, Soumitri, briefly tarry at the close of Seetha as I wish to eliminate these demons who have trailed the path of that demoness to here."
Aranya Kanda,20,5,"On hearing that word of Rama, then the nimble-souled Lakshmana honoured the word of Rama saying ""so be it."""
Aranya Kanda,20,6,On taking up his awful bow that is decorated with gold Raghava stringed it with bowstring and even spoke the demons as a forewarning.
Aranya Kanda,20,7,"""We the sons of Dasharatha are brothers named Rama and Lakshmana, and we entered the impenetrable forests Dandaka along with Seetha."
Aranya Kanda,20,8,"""We the dispassionate subsist on fruits and tubers treading in the path of virtue, and we being the sages resident in Dandaka forest what for you outrage us."
Aranya Kanda,20,9,"""As assigned by the sages I chanced here with bow and arrows to decimate you evil-souled and unrighteous beings in a crucial clash."
Aranya Kanda,20,10,"""Stay there obligingly or you should not be able to return, else if you desire your lives, oh, nightwalkers, you may return now."
Aranya Kanda,20,11,"On hearing that sentence of Rama they the fourteen ghoulish demons who are the slayers of Brahmans and handlers of spears have become highly infuriated, and they with their bloodshot eyes and with harsh words said these words to Rama, whose eyes are with blood streaks at their ends, and who also is a sweet talker, and whose valour is yet unseen by those fourteen demons. [3-20-11, 12]"
Aranya Kanda,20,13,"""Killed in conflict by us you alone will set your lives loose as an inciter of fury in our highly great souled lord Khara."
Aranya Kanda,20,14,"""Indeed, what capability you have as a lone one to stand against many of us in the forefront of war, and why tell again about your battling ability in a given battle."
Aranya Kanda,20,15,"""When we launch maces, spears and swords by our might you will forgo your lives, mettle, and even the bow now clasped in your hand."" So said the demons to Rama."

Aranya Kanda,20,16,"""Oh! Supreme Person, we have come here because you incited anger in our lord Khara, and by us killed will you let go your lives, mettle and spirits? No. Never it will happen."""
Aranya Kanda,20,17,"The reason for not happening of that event is explained: raNa muurdhan in war's, van; ekasya te agrataH sthaatum lone one, you, before, to stand; bahuunaam asmaakam api many, we are, though; kaa shaktiH where is, capability for us"
Aranya Kanda,20,18,"""Though you are a lone being, and we are many, where is the capability for us to stand before you in the van of war?"""

It is better to die at your hand than returning to Khara and dying a merciless death at the hand of Khara."
Aranya Kanda,20,21,"It may be remembered that these fourteen are the cursed Vedic-scholarly disciples of Chandrakanta, now in an accursed form namely Khara and other demons. Maheshvara Tiirtha."
Aranya Kanda,20,22,"Thus saying that way clamorously they the fourteen demons, upraising their weapons they unhesitatingly rushed towards Rama alone, and they hurled lances towards that unconquerable Raghava. [3-20-16, 17a]"
Aranya Kanda,20,23,"Rama in turn shredded all of those fourteen lances only with as many arrows that are adorned in gold. [3-20-17b, 18a]"
Aranya Kanda,20,24,"Next that great resplendent Rama in high wrath took up fourteen iron bolt like arrows that are whetted on whetstone and equalling the sun in their dazzle. [3-20-18b, 19a]"
Aranya Kanda,20,25,"Then Raghava took up his bow, arched it, and aiming at the targeted demons released arrows as Indra would release his Thunderbolts. [3-20-19b, 20a]"
Aranya Kanda,20,26,"And by the force of their speed those arrows gored the chests of those demons, and then on coming out bedaubed with blood they swiftly penetrated into earth like snakes into snake pit. [3-20-20b, 21a]"
Aranya Kanda,20,27,"Those arrows bursting their hearts they are blood bathed, mangled, and utterly dead, and like the uprooted trees they fell onto the ground. [3-20-21b, 22a]"
Aranya Kanda,20,28,"On seeing the demons falling onto ground that demoness Shuurpanakha is convulsed in rage, and she with a blanched aspect returned to the near of Khara in an agonising manner like a creeper exuding resin on incision, and fell before him as before. [3-20-22b, 23]"
Aranya Kanda,20,24,"Then she in the presence of her brother Khara discharged a great outcry, and with a bloodless face she spilled tears attuning the strains of a whiner."
Aranya Kanda,20,25,"Shuurpanakha having seen the fall of demons quickly fled from Panchavati of Rama to trikanTaka, the capital of Khara, and she being the sister of Khara she reported to Khara all about the destruction of those demons, in its entirety."
Aranya Kanda,21,1,"On seeing Shuurpanakha who came back only to wreck havoc on demonic race and again fell before him as before, Khara spoke this sentence to her in clear terms in all his fury."
Aranya Kanda,21,2,"""What for your are howling again when I have just now commanded those fearless flesh eating demons in order to fulfill your wish?"
Aranya Kanda,21,3,"""Those demons are my admirers, adherers and they always remained my well-wishers, hence there is no question of their non-accomplishment of my orders."
Aranya Kanda,21,4,"""Owing to what you are highly bawling by saying, 'haa, lord' and wriggle on the ground like a snake? I would like to know the reason for all this, what is it?"
Aranya Kanda,21,5,"""I am here to take care of you, then why should you really cry out like an uncared-for being, get up...get up, and ward off this sort of perplexity."" Thus Khara said to Shuurpanakha."
Aranya Kanda,21,6,"She that Shuurpanakha who is otherwise an unassuageable one is wholly pacified when Khara spoke to her thus that way, and she on dabbing her tearful eyes then spoke to her brother Khara."
Aranya Kanda,21,7,"""I came to you just a while back with my ears and nose chopped off and wet with gushes of blood, and you too have comforted me, isn't it."
Aranya Kanda,21,8,"""Oh, valiant brother, for my delight you too have sent fourteen demons to eliminate that atrocious Rama along with Lakshmana, isn't it?"
Aranya Kanda,21,9,"""But they all who handled their spears and bolts along with an envious anger are killed in a fight with Rama by his arrows that cleave the crucial parts of his opponents."
Aranya Kanda,21,10,"""On seeing those highly impetuous demons falling to earth in a trice, and even on seeing the unusual deed of Rama in felling them, I am highly alarmed."
Aranya Kanda,21,11,"""Oh me! I am alarmed, fully frenzied, and even despaired, oh, nightwalker Khara, and beholding dread everywhere again I have come seeking your refuge."
Aranya Kanda,21,12,"""Why do not you rescue me when I am drowned in a vast ocean called grief, wherein each pervasive crocodile is despair and each swelling wave is fright."
Aranya Kanda,21,13,"""Besides, those flesh-eating demons that have followed me are also felled by Rama with his sharp arrows, for whom I have a contrite heart."
Aranya Kanda,21,14,"""If you have mercy on me, and even on those dead demons, and if ability and animation are still left in you to cope with Rama, oh, nightwalker, kill that Rama who is a thorn in the side of demons dwelling in Dandaka forest. [3-21-14, 15a]"
Aranya Kanda,21,15,"""If you are not going to kill that enemy destroyer Rama now itself, I will give up my life unhesitatingly, that too in your fore, that too now itself."
Aranya Kanda,21,16,"If you are not going to kill that enemy destroyer Rama now itself, now itself I will give up my life than living a shameless life with these lopped ears and nose. [3-21-15b, 16a]"
Aranya Kanda,21,17,"""I can perceive instinctually that you are incapable of affronting Rama in a given crucial battle, even if your are with all your forces on the battlefield, and you assert yourself a valiant, but you are just vainglorious. [3-21-16b, 17]"
Aranya Kanda,21,18,"""Kill those two, Rama and Lakshmana, as they are just humans, or else, if you are incapable of doing so, really what for is your stay here in Janasthaana with your trivial stamina and trifling sinews like a stupid blemishing his clan, then get out of this Janasthaana at once along with your hench-demons.

Aranya Kanda,21,20,"""You will completely and quickly evanish, indeed, subjugated by resplendence of Rama, for that Dasharatha's son Rama possess that kind of resplendence, in effect."

Aranya Kanda,22,1,Thus when Shuurpanakha disparaged that valiant Khara amidst demons he is infuriated and spoke these highly hurtful words.
Aranya Kanda,22,2,"""This fury of mine originating from the disgrace brought on you is like the highly bitter salt water that is impossible to contain when ingested."
Aranya Kanda,22,3,"""I do not care the valour of that Rama for he is a human with dwindled lifetime, now going to give up his life slain by his own misdoings."
Aranya Kanda,22,4,"""Control your tears and cast off your despair too, for I will send Rama to the abode of the Terminator along with his brother."
Aranya Kanda,22,5,"""Now, you demoness, you will swill that Rama's red hot blood when that short-lived one is hewed down to earth with an axe."" So Khara assured Shuurpanakha."
Aranya Kanda,22,6,"On hearing the words plunged from the mouth of Khara she is very much gladdened and in all her stupidity she further praised her brother highly saying, ""you are the best among all the demons..."""
Aranya Kanda,22,7,"Though she denounced him earlier she alone praised him now for which Khara is overjoyed, and then he ordered his army commander, namely Duushana."
Aranya Kanda,22,8,"""Those who are the followers of my will, whose hustle will be frightful and who will be unretreating in combats, such of those demons are there in fourteen thousand numbers, aren't they."
Aranya Kanda,22,9,"""And oh, gentle Duushana, those domineering demons are with dark-clouds like complexions, and they are the pamperers of genocide, as such, cause them for a belligerency, all at once."
Aranya Kanda,22,10,"""For me, oh, gentle one, promptly position my chariot before me along with bows and arrows, amazing swords and diverse sharp power bolts."
Aranya Kanda,22,11,"""Oh, war pert Duushana, I wish to start ahead of all the demons of ours, who are the clans-demons of the great souled Paulastya, for the purpose of elimination of that evil-minded Rama."" So said Khara to Duushana."
Aranya Kanda,22,12,"While Khara is saying thus Duushana heralded saying, ""Here comes the great chariot with sun's dazzle, yoked with very good horses of variegated colours."""
Aranya Kanda,22,13,"That chariot which has a roomy cabin with its rooftop like that of the ridge of Mt.

[3-22-13, 14, 15]"
Aranya Kanda,22,16,"On overseeing that great army with chariots, skins shields, weaponry and flags, and even at Duushana too, Khara charged all those demons saying ""proceed."""
Aranya Kanda,22,17,"Then that demonic force with their ghoulish skin shields, weaponry and flags, issued forth from Janasthaana, blaring blatantly and foraying dashingly."
Aranya Kanda,22,16,"Wielding maces, dart-bolts, and spears, and also razor-sharp axes, swords and discs, and dreadful power-darts and power-bolts that are flashing, iron maces, unusual bows, clubs, scimitars and pounding-shafts, and even thunderbolt like weapons that are calamitous in look, that army which comprises fourteen thousand fiendish demons that are the followers of Khara's whim, has started from Janasthaana. [3-22-18, 19, 20]"
Aranya Kanda,22,21,"On seeing the outrush of those demons of diabolic appearance, then Khara's chariot also proceeded a little later at their behind."
Aranya Kanda,22,22,Then the charioteer set spurs on those colourful horses that are adorned in polished gold according to the notions of Khara.
Aranya Kanda,22,23,"When the chariot of enemy destroyer Khara is driven that impetuously, it has started to swell earth's four cardinal quarters and inter-quarters with turbulence."
Aranya Kanda,22,24,"He whose voice is thunderous and whose rancour escalated speedily, and who is hastening forward like the Terminator intending to destroy his enemy, that Khara repeatedly hurried the charioteer shouting at him loudly like a overwhelming cloud that is going to storm stones."
Aranya Kanda,23,1,A massy and tumultuous ass-coloured cloud rained ill-omened bloody water while that fiendish force is advancing.
Aranya Kanda,23,2,"The highly speedy horses paired to Khara's chariot have tottered in a trice, even though that place on the highway is with even surface and spread with flowers."
Aranya Kanda,23,3,Capturing the sun a blackish corona with blood-red outer circle has formed and nested around it like the fiery ring formed by circling a fireball.
Aranya Kanda,23,4,"Then, nearing the golden shaft of the flag of the chariot with a very lofty flagstaff, an awful eagle with massive body occupied and perched atop of that golden shaft."
Aranya Kanda,23,5,Cacophonous and carnivorous predators and vultures took over the nearby places of Janasthaana and they made raucous sounds of many kinds.
Aranya Kanda,23,6,"Turning towards the stretch scorched by the sun, fearsome and loud noised jackals have howled emitting awful sounds, that which is inauspicious to the demons."
Aranya Kanda,23,7,Then frightening clouds similar to bursting mountains carrying bloodlike water have rendered the firmament less of leeway.
Aranya Kanda,23,8,"There chanced an abominable, cataclysmic, hair-raising darkness whereby the milieus or inter-milieus are not very clearly brightened."
Aranya Kanda,23,9,"An untimely eventide glistened with a colour similar to the one drenched in blood, and then horrendous brutes and birds have clamoured facing Khara directly, and the vultures, jackals and eagles too have screamed portending danger. [3-23-9, 10a]"
Aranya Kanda,23,10,"Jackals, that too female jackals, are always the agents of inauspiciousness in wars with demonstrable calamities brought forth by their portending howling, and such jackals have now howled in front of Khara's army with their snouts spewing blazes."
Aranya Kanda,23,11,"A spherical object like that of a human trunk is revealed near at the sun, while the sun is rendered shineless as though Rahu, the great eclipsing-planet, has eclipsed him inopportunely, and the wind too whirled frantically. [3-23-11b, 12]"
Aranya Kanda,23,12,"Stars sprang up with the brilliance of fireflies though it is not night, and at that moment fishes and waterfowls stood still in lakes, lotuses have dried up, flowers and fruits have dropped from trees as though it is night. [3-23-13, 14a]"
Aranya Kanda,23,13,"Without any puffing of wind dust in brownish-red colour is heaved up, and there the songbirds like Maina started to twitter as 'cii cii kuu cii'. [3-23-14b, 15a]"
Aranya Kanda,23,14,"Meteors horrible in their look have fallen down thunderously, and even the earth together with its mountains, woods and forests quaked shakily. [3-23-15b, 16a]"
Aranya Kanda,23,15,"He who is raving while sitting in his chariot that clever Khara's left shoulder thrilled excessively, and his voice too quavered. [3-23-16b, 17a]"
Aranya Kanda,23,16,"While he is seeing everywhere his eyes spawned tears for no good reason, his forehead ached, but he did not retrace his steps owing to his own vanity. [3-23-17b, 18a]"
Aranya Kanda,23,17,"On observing those worst auguries stemming up at that moment with hair-raising nature, Khara laughed them off and said this to all of the demons. [3-23-18b, 19a]"
Aranya Kanda,23,18,"""These awful auguries with their horrible nature have arisen, but owing to my own valour I am unbothered about all of them as with a mighty one unworried of the mightless. [3-23-19b, 20a]"
Aranya Kanda,23,19,"""With the excruciating arrows of mine I can hurtle stars from the face of sky, and if highly infuriated, I can even enjoin mortality to Death himself. [3-23-20b, 21a]"
Aranya Kanda,23,20,"""I am reluctant to return without killing that Rama, a haughty one by his might, together with his brother Lakshmana, with my incisive arrows. [3-23-21b, 22a]"
Aranya Kanda,23,21,"""In whose respect both Rama and Lakshmana behaved perversely, let that sister of mine be contented in drinking the blood of those two. [3-23-22b, 23a]"
Aranya Kanda,23,22,"""No defeat has chanced on me in combats at anytime and anywhere, that to you all is obvious and I tell no untruth. [3-23-23b, 24a]"
Aranya Kanda,23,23,"""If I am infuriated I can eliminate even the king of gods, wielder of Thunderbolt and a trekker on ruttish elephant Iravata, namely Indra in a war, then why talk about these two humans."" Thus Khara addressed his troops. [3-23-24b, 25a]"
Aranya Kanda,23,24,"On hearing that thundering speech of Khara that sizeable army of demons which is tied down by the noose of death obtained an incomparable rejoice. [3-23-25b, 26a]"
Aranya Kanda,23,25,"Then desiring to see the war of Khara with Rama, great-souls like sages, gods, gandharva-s along with carana-s and siddha-s have come together in firmament. [3-23-26b, 27a]"
Aranya Kanda,23,26,"On gathering at a place those great souls met one another and said, ""let good betide cows, Brahmans and those that are held respectful by the people at large."" [3-23-27b, 28a]"
Aranya Kanda,23,28,"""Let Raghava triumph over these mighty night walkers from the lineage of Pulastya, as with Vishnu who once conquered all the mighty demons in war."" So said celestials to one another."
Aranya Kanda,23,28,"While the great sages are speaking about this and many other topics, they and the gods abiding in their aircrafts have inquisitively seen the flow of army of demons, whose longevity is now beyond hope. [3-23-29, 30]"
Aranya Kanda,23,31,"Khara speedily bolted in his chariot to the van of his legions, and on seeing that demon Khara going in front other important demons too rushed to fore. They are Shyenagaami, Prithugviira, Yajnashatru, Vihamgama and also Durjaya, Karaviiraaksha, Parusha, Kaalakaarmuka, Hemamaali, Mahaamaali, Sarpaasya, Rudhiraaksha. These twelve highly valorous demons cruised in a semicircle around Khara."
Aranya Kanda,23,33,"Likewsie Mahakapaala, Stuulaaksha, Pramaathii, Trishira are the four commanders of demonic forces and they followed Duushana marching at his behind."
Aranya Kanda,23,34,"That army of valiant demons which is highly execrable, infernally speedy, and readily inspirited for a battle quickly rushed towards those two princes, Rama and Lakshmana, as though a festoon of planets would rush towards the Moon and Sun so as to put them to rout."
Aranya Kanda,24,1,"While fiercely valorous Khara proceeded towards Rama's hermitage, Rama along with his brother Lakshmana has indeed seen the very same auguries which have earlier appeared to Khara."
Aranya Kanda,24,2,"On looking at those very gruesomely bad omens, and perceiving them to be unpropitious to people, Rama spoke this sentence to Lakshmana."
Aranya Kanda,24,3,"""Oh, dextrous Lakshmana, for the complete elimination of all the demons these great indications have arisen, as though betokening the annihilation of all beings. See them."
Aranya Kanda,24,4,"""On their part these clouds are hovering on the sky with stark reddish-grey tint, thunderously braying and copiously showering streams of blood."
Aranya Kanda,24,5,"""All my arrows too are incensed to fuming in an ecstasy towards a war, and dorsally gold-plated bows of mine are incessantly spurring to hook up those arrows, telling apart the impeding conflict."
Aranya Kanda,24,6,"""Judging by the kind of wild birds that are shrieking here, danger is up ahead and coming upon us, along with uncertainty of our lives."
Aranya Kanda,24,8,"""This right hand of mine is indicating by its repeated throbbing that a critical and riotous conflict is going to occur, no doubt, but oh brave one, our victory and defeat to the enemies are also in vicinity, and for sure, your face is also appearing brightish and aglow, which itself is a good omen."
Aranya Kanda,24,9,"""If the faces of those that are poised for a conflict loose lustre, deem that the death is looming large on their longevity too."
Aranya Kanda,24,10,"""This nasty noise which we hear pertains to the uproar of demons, and even to the drumming of war drums by the demons of fiendish activities, and this is ear-splitting."
Aranya Kanda,24,11,"""Preventive measures are to be effectuated for any imminent situation by any well-wishing person, or by a person with misgivings about a danger, or by a person of talent."
Aranya Kanda,24,12,"""Hence, wield your bow, keep arrows ready at hand, and taking Vaidehi with you seek shelter in a impassable cave of a mountain overgrown with trees."
Aranya Kanda,24,13,"""I wish you to gainsay me for this word of mine, my boy, have honour on my feet and be gone not before long."
Aranya Kanda,24,14,"""You are a stalwart, a forceful one, and for sure you can eliminate them all, it is doubtless, but I long to eliminate all of the nightwalkers, personally"" Rama said thus to Lakshmana."
Aranya Kanda,24,15,"When Rama said to him that way, Lakshmana picked up his bow and arrows, and together with Seetha he took shelter in an unreachable cave."
Aranya Kanda,24,16,"On Lakshmana's entering into cave along with Seetha, Rama said to himself, ""thank goodness, it is a good-idea!"" and thus saying he donned his shield."
Aranya Kanda,24,17,Well bedecked in a shield that has fire-like brilliance that Rama shone forth like a fumeless conflagration up-shot in utter darkness.
Aranya Kanda,24,18,"On raising his imposing bow and drawing arrows, that valorous Rama firmed up and stood there, filling all the directions with the tinny sounds of bowstring."
Aranya Kanda,24,19,Gods with gandharva-s and great-souled siddha-s along with carana-s have then met one another and came there aspiring to see the war.
Aranya Kanda,24,20,"The great-souled sages and those that are known in worlds as eminent Brahma-sages, on their coming together those beings of pious exploits spoke to one another, among themselves."
Aranya Kanda,24,21,"""Let good betide cows, Brahmans and those people that are abiding in all the worlds. Raghava shall be victorious in the war over the clansmen of Sage Paulastya, the nightwalkers."" Thus they talked among themselves."
Aranya Kanda,24,21,"Thus speaking they also well-said again, looking at each other ""the demons of fiendish deeds are fourteen thousand in number and this virtue-souled Rama is solitary... what would be the result of this war!"" Thus the sages discussed among themselves. [3-24-22b, 23]"
Aranya Kanda,24,24,"Thus the assemblages of kingly-sages, siddha-s and the eminent Brahmans, along with gods that are staying in their aircrafts, tarried there in the firmament peering inquisitively at Rama."
Aranya Kanda,24,25,"Immured in an aura of invincibility Rama is standing up to the war in its vanguard, and then on seeing at him all beings went into the throes of dread."
Aranya Kanda,24,26,"That nonesuch aspect of Rama whose deeds are unharmful to any, has become the aspect of wrathful supreme-souled Rudra."
Aranya Kanda,24,25,"While gods, gandharva-s, carana-s are conversing thus, then they have seen there the legions of the demons arriving from all over with boisterous noises, spouting cries of bravo, handling their grisly skins, shields, weaponry and war-flags, and onrushing at each other in disarray. With brassy twanging of bows, with the drumming of war drums, and even by their jumping, leaping and bouncing that area is filled with very loud and clamorous noise. [3-24-27, 28, 29]"
Aranya Kanda,24,26,"When highly brutish cacophony of demons started to fill the forest, that jangling even panicked the brutes ranging in that forest, and those beasts dashed off to other places where silence prevailed, without looking back. [3-24-30, 31a]"
Aranya Kanda,24,27,"And that foolhardy army of demons which in simile is like an unnavigable ocean steered towards Rama handling many assault weapons. [3-24-31b, 32a]"
Aranya Kanda,24,28,"Casting his sight all-over even that war-expert Rama has seen that army of Khara lunging at a conflict. [3-24-32b, 33a]"
Aranya Kanda,24,33,"Rama stretched his awesome bow to examine the taut of bowstring, and even whipped arrows out of quiver, and then adopted a mask of extreme wrath to eliminate all the demons."
Aranya Kanda,24,34,"And when he is enraged and blazing he became frightful-looking like the blazing Fire at the end of era, and on seeing such a Rama when he is pervaded with conflagration like anger, the pastoral deities are very much annoyed."
Aranya Kanda,24,35,"The all-pacific aspect of that Rama then in his exasperation appeared to be like that of the all-ruinous Rudra, the wielder of bow called Pinaki, namely peaceful Shiva when enraged, at the time of Rudra's embarking on to ruin the Vedic ritual of Daksha Prajaapati."
Aranya Kanda,24,36,"That army of raw-flesh eaters with their bows, embellishments, and chariots, and also with their armours, all glittering with the dazzle of flaming fire, varied into a sky-blue coloured cluster of clouds on which the dazzling sunrays will be glittering at the dawning of the sun."
Aranya Kanda,25,1,"There are fourteen thousand demons against one Rama, and the Divine beings watch this from heavens as a sport, without according any miraculous powers to Rama, suggesting that a human has to face any number of problems, here fourteen thousand demons, for himself and no divine grace suddenly comes to his help."
Aranya Kanda,25,2,"Rama gives the demons enough time and warning, but as the atrocity is escalating, he uses one gandharva missile and many other arrows, which will devastate the entire army of Dushana's brute force."
Aranya Kanda,25,1,Khara on arriving at the hermitage along with forerunning soldiers saw the enemy-eliminator and wrathful Rama holding fast to his bow.
Aranya Kanda,25,2,"On seeing Rama that bawling Khara raised his string-taut bow that makes an ass-like braying twang, drove his charioteer crazy saying, ""drive to the fore of that Rama..."""
Aranya Kanda,25,3,On the orders of Khara the charioteer drove the horses to there where the mighty armed Rama is standing single-handedly while swaying his bow.
Aranya Kanda,25,4,On seeing Khara descending on Rama then all those nightwalkers who are the deputies of Khara encircled Khara venting out loud battle cries.
Aranya Kanda,25,5,Khara staying on his chariot in the thick of those demons appeared to be like coppery-red planet Mars up-shot in the thick of stars.
Aranya Kanda,25,6,In his proneness to war then Khara assaulted that uniquely forceful Rama with a thousand arrows and blared a roaring battle cry.
Aranya Kanda,25,7,All of those infuriated nightwalkers then incessantly rained diverse weapons on that invincibleRama who is handling a horrific bow.
Aranya Kanda,25,8,"Those demons that are already caught up with rancour bombarded Rama with bludgeons, lances, tridents, darts and hatchets."
Aranya Kanda,25,11,"Those massive bodied and exceptionally mighty demons came jostling like immense clouds in their eagerness to kill Rama in that war, while some mounted on chariots and horsebacks, and some more riding mountain-ridges like elephants rushed in on Rama. [3-25-9,10a]"
Aranya Kanda,25,12,"And those bands of demons have outpoured arrows on Rama, as with enormous black-clouds disemboguing torrents on a lofty mountain. [3-25-10b, 11a]"
Aranya Kanda,25,13,"When hemmed in with those grisly-looking demons Rama appeared like Rudra surrounded by his divine retinue called prathama gaNa-s, on certain days, whereupon he starts his all-destructive cosmic-dance. [3-25-11b, 12a]"
Aranya Kanda,25,14,"That Raghava has pre-empted those arrows discharged by the demons with his excruciatingly pointed arrows as an ocean would do with the river's onrush. [3-25-12b, 13a]"
Aranya Kanda,25,15,"Even if his body is gashed with those gruesome assault weapons Rama is not enfeebled, as with the enormous Mt. Meru that can withstand even if battered by very many highly blazing thunderbolts of Indra. [3-25-13, 14a]"
Aranya Kanda,25,16,"Bruised and bedaubed with blood on all his limbs that Rama of Raghu's dynasty took shape of the sun enshrouded by cloudscapes at eventide. [3-25-14b, 15a]"
Aranya Kanda,25,17,"On seeing lone Rama beset by many demons, then the gods, celestials, saints and sublime-sages are dispirited. [3-25-15b, 16a]"
Aranya Kanda,25,18,"But Rama on becoming highly infuriated curved his bow to a full circularity on stretching the bowstring up to his ear, and then jetted out trenchant arrows in hundreds. Why hundreds? He surged them in thousands. [3-25-16b, 17a]"
Aranya Kanda,25,19,"In that war Rama sportily discharged eagle-feathered arrows adorned in gold which are unstoppable and intolerable, and which in simile are the leads of Time-god. [3-25-17b, 18a]"
Aranya Kanda,25,20,"Those arrows that are playfully discharged on the army of enemy have grabbed the lives of demons like the tethers flung by the Time-god. [3-25-18b, 19a]"
Aranya Kanda,25,21,"On impaling the bodies demons, the arrows swamped in blood have gone into welkin, where they are aglow with flares equalling inflamed flames. [3-25-19b, 20a]"
Aranya Kanda,25,22,"Innumerable and highly frightening arrows fusilladed from the nimbus of the bow of Rama that resulted as the filchers of the lives of demons. [3-25-20b, 21a]"
Aranya Kanda,25,23,"In that war, shooting now with hundreds, and now with thousands of such arrows, Rama shredded those many bows, pinnacles of war-flags, armours and the like. And even shred are the heads of demons, along with their ornamented arms and thighs similar to the trunks of elephants. [3-25-21b, 22]"
Aranya Kanda,25,23,"With the arrows flung from the bow-bowstring-nimbus of Rama, he indeed shredded and scraped the horses hitched with golden harnesses, and the chariots to which they are yoked, and even their charioteers. Likewise, he even ripped off the elephants along with their riders, and the horses along with their cavaliers. And on eliminating infantrymen in that war Rama led them to the abode of Yama, the Time-god. [3-25-23, 24]"
Aranya Kanda,25,25,"While ripped to pieces with tubular arrows, with arrows made of iron, and with sharp-edged and crescent-tipped arrows those demons have let out disgusting cries of anguish."
Aranya Kanda,25,26,"When those arrows that gore the critical parts are thus harrowing, that army is discomposed like a forest burnt to a cinder by wild-fire."
Aranya Kanda,25,27,"Some of the grotesquely sinewy and braving nightwalkers are highly enraged and dashed their darts, tridents, and hatchets towards Rama."
Aranya Kanda,25,28,On fending off those weapons with his arrows that mighty armed and valorous Rama filched away their lives by shearing off their necks in that war.
Aranya Kanda,25,29,"Those demons crashed down to earth with their heads severed and shields and bows wrecked, like the trees strewn around on earth owing to the gust raised by Garuda, the Divine Eagle, when he takes a sudden flight in heavens."
Aranya Kanda,25,30,"Those nightwalkers that are battered by those arrows and remaining there, they desperately rushed towards Khara alone seeking shelter."
Aranya Kanda,25,31,"Comforting all of them and taking his bow, very highly infuriated Duushana rushed towards that infuriated Rama like the furious Eliminator Yama."
Aranya Kanda,25,31,"That highly infuriated Duushana rushed towards Rama as highly infuriated Yama rushes towards Rudra, where Rudra being the ultimate eliminator himself, angry rush of Yama towards Rudra is therefore futile."
Aranya Kanda,25,32,"Coming under the shelter of Duushana all of those demons are but emboldened and returned, and they once again rushed towards Rama with saala trees, palm trees and boulders as their weapons."
Aranya Kanda,25,34,"Handling tridents, maces, and leashes those great-mighty demons have created torrents of arrows, missiles, trees and boulders, and inundated Rama in that war. [3-25-33, 34a]"
Aranya Kanda,25,35,"Again there chanced a highly gruesome war between Rama and those demons that is tumultuous, stunning, and a hair-raising. [3-25-34b, 35a]"
Aranya Kanda,25,36,"Those demons have resurfaced from all around pressurising Raghava in high dudgeon. On seeing the reappearance of demons from everywhere, with whom all the directions and inter-directions are fully filled, and who are storming torrents of arrows, then that exceptionally forceful Rama made a thunderous sound and launched an extremely blazing missile among the gather of demons, called gandharva missile. [3-25-35b, 36, 37]"
Aranya Kanda,25,38,"Then from the nimbus of his bow, arrows in thousand have scurried out, and with them thus arrived all the ten sides are cramped up."
Aranya Kanda,25,39,"Either the drawing of those supreme arrows from the quiver, or the traction of bowstring on placing them, or unloosing them from the bow is unperceived by those demons that are harrowing under those arrows."
Aranya Kanda,25,40,"Darkness caused by the thick of the arrows overspread the sky including its sun, while Rama happened to persevere spewing forth his arrows."
Aranya Kanda,25,41,"Far and wide the earth is scattered with herds that are falling instantaneously, hosts that have fallen instantly, and huddles that are already felled with an instantaneity."
Aranya Kanda,25,42,"Thousands of demons are noticeable hither and yon, killed, fallen and enfeebled, and slashed, gashed and ripped."
Aranya Kanda,25,42,"Some severed heads still have their headgears and some bare, some arms are with armlets and some bare, while some with their arms cut off, some with their thighs cut off, some with their divers patterns of ornaments on their bodies have fallen on ground. Numerous horses and elephants are felled. Chariots, royal-fans, royal-parasols, war-flags of very many kinds are ravaged in many ways. Hit down by Rama's arrows spears and tridents are variously splintered, swords broken to pieces, darts and hatchets shattered and strewn around. Also the boulders are pulverised, various amazing arrows have gone to rack and ruin in many ways. Spread with such wreckage the earth has become horrifying for a glance. [3-25-43, 44, 45, 46]"
Aranya Kanda,25,47,"On seeing the killed demons all the surviving demons have become enervated and they are rendered incapable to make a move towards Rama, the conqueror of enemy's capitals."
Aranya Kanda,26,1,"On seeing the shattering of his own forces, Duushana bid five thousand mighty-armed nightwalkers of monstrous impetus, and who knew no retreat in war, to attack Rama."
Aranya Kanda,26,2,"And they with spears, scimitars, swords, and with the rains of boulders, trees and arrows rained incessantly and inordinately upon Rama from all over. [3-26-2b, 3a]"
Aranya Kanda,26,3,"Raghava, the virtue-souled, in his turn has neutralised that ghastly and life-taking storm of boulders and trees with his fierce arrows. [3-26-3b, 4a]"
Aranya Kanda,26,4,"Like a bull receiving rain with closed eyes Rama assimilated that storming and then evoked an inordinate infuriation for eliminating all of the demons. [3-26-4b, 5a]"
Aranya Kanda,26,5,"Exasperation prevailing on him who appeared to be highly blazing with the blaze of his own virtue, he then diffused Duushana and his army with arrows from all over. [3-26-5b, 6a]"
Aranya Kanda,26,6,"And on becoming enraged Duushana, the railer of his rivals and the commander of that army, then virtually forestalled Raghava's onslaught with his arrows that are simulative of thunderbolts. [3-26-6b, 7a]"
Aranya Kanda,26,7,"That valiant one in warring Rama is then infuriated and with his crescent-barbed arrow shivered the sturdy bow of Duushana, shredding four of his horses with four more arrows. [3-26-7b, 8a]"
Aranya Kanda,26,8,"On destructing the horses with excruciating arrows, he even fragmented the head of the charioteer with a crescent-barbed arrow, and even impaled the chest of demon Duushana with some more arrows. [3-26-8b, 9a]"
Aranya Kanda,26,9,"With his bow fractured and chariot shredded, and with horses and charioteer killed, he that Duushana grabbed a mace which outranks a peak of mountain and a hair-thriller at its sight, and which girt with golden girths once gritted the armies of gods, the head of which is studded with incisive iron spikes and saturated with the fat of foes, a coequal of a diamond and a thunderbolt in its hardiness and flashiness, and a ransacker of the archways of fortresses of his adversaries. [3-26-9b, 10, 11]"
Aranya Kanda,26,12,"On firmly gripping that mace which in war is akin to an infernal serpent, and the touch of which tantamount to snakebite, rushed that nightwalker Duushana with infernal exerts rushed towards Rama."
Aranya Kanda,26,13,"While Duushana came falling on, he that Raghava sheared off his shoulders that have wrist-ornaments on his arms with two arrows."
Aranya Kanda,26,14,"When Duushana's arms are thus sheared in the van of war, his gigantic mace slipped and spun in his own front, like the flagstaff with flag raised in honour of Indra, and collapsed ."
Aranya Kanda,26,15,With both of his arms strewn around Duushana fell down onto earth like a haughty and gigantic elephant when both of its tusks are broken down.
Aranya Kanda,26,16,"On seeing Duushana eliminated and fallen to ground, all the beings have applauded Rama saying, 'good, good...'"
Aranya Kanda,26,15,"In the meantime infuriated are the three leading commanders of that army, namely Mahakapaala, Sthulaaksha and great mighty Pramaathii, and they collectively ran towards Rama, bound by the rein of death. [3-26-17, 18a]"
Aranya Kanda,26,16,"Mahakapaala raising a broad trident, Sthulaaksha handling a scimitar, Pramaathi handling an axe rushed towards Rama. [3-26-18b, 19a]"
Aranya Kanda,26,17,"As one would receive guests meeting his basic needs, Raghava too took on these untimely guests of war, rather the insurgents, meeting their basic needs which now are no more than highly sharpened acute edged arrows, when he saw them coming and falling upon him, inopportunely. [3-26-19b, 20a]"
Aranya Kanda,26,18,"Rama, the legatee of Raghu, chopped off the head of Mahakapaala, with incalculable spates of arrows he eliminated Pramaathi, and filled the bulging eyes of Sthulaaksha with arrows by which Sthulaaksha is killed and fell down onto ground like a burly tree with its broad branches. Then still infuriated Rama forthwith eliminated the five thousand hench-demons of Duushana with five thousand arrows, and thus he led them to the residence of Time-god, namely the hell. [3-26-20b, 21, 22, 23a]"
Aranya Kanda,26,19,"On hearing about the killing of Duushana and also thus of the followers of Duushana, Khara irately ordered his army captains, under whose captaincy mighty forces are there. [3-26-23b, 24a]"
Aranya Kanda,26,20,"""Duushana is killed in war along with his followers, hence all you demons, take formidable army, take weapons of diverse designs, combat and kill that evil-human Rama..."" Thus Khara ordered the remaining demons. [3-26-24b, 25]"
Aranya Kanda,26,21,"Saying so Khara himself rushed towards Rama in rage, and Shyenagaami, Prithugriiva, Yajnashatru, Vihangama Durjaya, Karaviiraaksha, Parusha, Kaalakaarmuka, Hemamaali, Mahaamaali, Sarpaasya, and Rudhiraaksha are the twelve fiendishly atrocious troop leaders of demonic forces, and they too rushed towards Rama launching their atrocious arrows. [3-26-26, 27, 28]"
Aranya Kanda,26,29,"He who is resplendent that Rama then annihilated the remaining demons of that army with his arrows that are embellished with gold and diamonds, and that are blazing like ritual-fires."
Aranya Kanda,26,30,"With those arrows that have golden tailpieces and sharp barbs, and that are dazzling like fuming ritual fires Rama felled the demons, as Thunderbolts of Indra will be felling gigantic trees."
Aranya Kanda,26,31,"With a hundred rudder like arrows Rama hit down a hundred demons, and with a thousand more, thousand more demons are hit in the forefront of that war."
Aranya Kanda,26,32,"Ripped are their shields and armorial-ornaments, ruined and rickety are their bows, and they the nightwalkers fell flat on ground, bodies wholly smudged with blood."
Aranya Kanda,26,33,"With those demons that have fallen down in war, whose hair is tousled and who are drenched in blood, entire earth looked like a vast altar of fire overspread with holy grass."
Aranya Kanda,26,34,"That forest which became sludgy with the flesh and blood of killed demons and very disgusting, in a moment it became identical with hell."
Aranya Kanda,26,35,"Thus that Rama, a lone one, that too a foot-soldier, has eliminated fourteen thousand demons of frightening exploits."
Aranya Kanda,26,36,"Of his entire army great-charioteer Khara and Trishira are the remaining nightwalkers, and Rama, the enemy destroyer, naturally on the other side."
Aranya Kanda,26,37,"Lakshmana's elder brother Rama eliminated all of the remaining demons in the forefront of war who are highly valorous, ghastly and unbearable."
Aranya Kanda,26,38,"Then on surveying that great demonic force which is eliminated by Rama in that staggering war, Khara then marched on to reach Rama in a huge chariot, as with Indra who will march upraising his Thunderbolt."
Aranya Kanda,27,1,"But when Khara is about to lunge to the forefront of Rama, nearing him the commander of demonic forces named Trishira spoke this to him."
Aranya Kanda,27,2,"""Desisting from your personal adventure you enjoin me for I am an invader, and then you are certain to see me felling that mighty-armed Rama in combat."
Aranya Kanda,27,3,"""Taking oath on my weapon I promise to you that I truly wish to kill this Rama, as he deserves ill of all the demons by killing."
Aranya Kanda,27,4,"""Hold back your combative-adventurism and become an examiner to decide whether I am going to become his god of death in this combat, or he becomes mine."
Aranya Kanda,27,5,"""If I were to kill Rama you may gladly proceed to Janasthaana, else if Rama kills me then you can adventurously proceed against him for a combat."" Thus Trishira spoke to Khara."
Aranya Kanda,27,6,"By that death-greedy demon Trishira, Khara is manoeuvred and Khara to him said 'begone... combat...' and thus permitted, Trishira proceeded to the forefront of Rama."
Aranya Kanda,27,7,"Trishira with a lustrous chariot that is yoked with equally lustrous horses hurried towards Rama in that war, like a tri-peaked mountain, for they say, he is a tri-headed demon."
Aranya Kanda,27,8,"Discharging hosts of arrow-torrents like a hefty-arrow-cloud, he readily discharged a noise similar to the thudding drumbeat when a water-wet war-drum is beaten, rather than a blast from a heated drum."
Aranya Kanda,27,9,"On seeing the oncoming of that demon Trishira, Raghava welcomed him by speedily winnowing smarting arrows from his bow."
Aranya Kanda,27,10,That grave and tumultuous encounter chanced between Rama and Trishira is like the extremely forceful encounter between a loin and an elephant.
Aranya Kanda,27,11,"Later when Trishira smote on the forehead of highly enraged Rama with three arrows, Rama's ire is intensified and he franticly said this to that demon."
Aranya Kanda,27,12,"""Oho! What an energy of a triumphing adventurer is this! A demon with this sort of energy is adventuring me, whose arrows rap my forehead peripherally, like flowers!"
Aranya Kanda,27,13,"""Now you accept arrows plunging from the string of my bow..."" saying thus, that infuriated Rama with his alacritous swiftness hit the chest of Trishira with fourteen arrows similar to venomous snakes. [3-27-13, 14a]"
Aranya Kanda,27,14,"With four of his straight shooting arrows that have hook-like barbs, that resplendent Rama hewed down four of the speedy horses of Trishira's chariot. [3-27-14b, 15a]"
Aranya Kanda,27,15,"With eight arrows Rama felled the charioteer from his settle on the chariot, and with one arrow ripped off the high flying flag on that chariot. [3-27-15b, 16a]"
Aranya Kanda,27,16,"When that nightwalker is vaulting from that smashed chariot Rama with his arrows tore his chest to shreds and he that Trishira became inert. [3-27-16b, 17a]"
Aranya Kanda,27,17,"And with three sharp and rapid arrows, and even with his own exasperation, Rama of inestimable aptitude rolled the three heads that demon. [3-27-17b, 18a]"
Aranya Kanda,27,18,"When that nightwalker is highly tortured with Rama's arrows he collapsed spewing blood with fumes, whereat he is standing in war, at where his three heads rolled just now. [3-27-18b, 19a]"
Aranya Kanda,27,19,"As with the fleeing of deer alarmed by a tiger, the demons remaining after liquidation, whom Khara has protected so far and whose confidence is now shattered, are running away, and they gave Khara the run-around. [3-27-19b, 20a]"
Aranya Kanda,27,20,"On seeing at those deserters Khara is piqued and quickly brought them back to his control, and then as with the scampering of eclipsing planet Rahu towards moon during lunar-eclipse, he scurried towards Rama alone. [3-27-20b, c]"
Aranya Kanda,28,1,Khara is intimidated on seeing the elimination of Duushana along with Trishira inasmuch as the intrepidity of Rama is concerned.
Aranya Kanda,28,2,"On seeing the annihilation of the insufferable and mighty force of demons, even that of Duushana and Trishira by lone Rama, and thus to apprehend that the demonic force is wholly destructed, that demon Khara became apprehensive, and then he lunged at Rama, as with demon Namuchi who once lunged at Indra. [4-28-2, 3]"
Aranya Kanda,28,4,"Forcefully drawing the bowstring fitted with iron-arrows, which looked like furious serpents of venom ingesting only blood, Khara discharged them on Rama."
Aranya Kanda,28,5,"Fidgeting with bowstring in many a way, brandishing missiles with many a skill, Khara moved about the battleground in many a manner, seated on chariot and showing his expertise with arrows."
Aranya Kanda,28,5,"That great chariot-fighter Khara then started to fill all the stretches and inter-stretches with arrows, seeing that even Rama reciprocally started to take aim with his bow Rama, and then filled and made the sky less of leeway with verily unendurable arrows that are like tongues of fire emitting sparks, as with Rain-god chocking the sky with torrents, less of latitude. [4-28-6, 7]"
Aranya Kanda,28,8,No empty space is left out in the space around since it has become riotous with the sharp arrows discharged by Rama and Khara from everywhere.
Aranya Kanda,28,9,"While both of them are warring with excitement to slay one another, then the sun obscured with the mesh of arrows has not shined."
Aranya Kanda,28,10,"Then with acutely edged tubular, iron, and crescent-edged arrows Khara swatted Rama in that combat, as a great elephant will be swatted with a goad."
Aranya Kanda,28,11,"When charioted Khara came to the presence of Rama with bow in hand and ready for a close combat, that demon appeared to all beings as the Terminator handling his noose."
Aranya Kanda,28,12,"Khara presumed that greatly indefatigable Rama is wholly fatigued by now, though he has shown his mettle of boldness in eliminating all of the demonic forces, all the while."
Aranya Kanda,28,13,"On seeing Khara who is prancing like a lion with a gait of a lion, Rama is unruffled like a lion that sees a least beast."
Aranya Kanda,28,14,In a chariot that equals the sun in its radiance then Khara reached Rama as a moth reaches fire.
Aranya Kanda,28,15,Showing sleight of hand Khara then broke the handgrip of the bow of that great-souled Rama along with an arrow fitted on it.
Aranya Kanda,28,16,Still infuriated Khara has drawn seven more arrows that equal the radiance of Indra's thunderbolts and hit Rama's armour in that war.
Aranya Kanda,28,17,"Then, on distressing Rama of unequalled vitality with a thousand arrows in that combat Khara blared a loud blare."
Aranya Kanda,28,18,"With the arrows released by Khara that have a great egress, then that armour of Rama that has a sun-like resplendence is completely destroyed and fell on the field."
Aranya Kanda,28,19,When all his limbs are hit with arrows Rama is enraged and in that war Rama flared up like a fumeless flaring fire.
Aranya Kanda,28,20,"Then Rama, the blaster of enemies, strung bowstring to another thunderously blasting bow, to end the enemy."
Aranya Kanda,28,21,"That which is a very admirable bow of Vishnu and that which is awarded by great-sage Agastya, upraising that choicest bow Rama rushed towards Khara."
Aranya Kanda,28,22,With arrows that have golden fins and curved barbs that highly infuriated Rama then fragmented Khara's flagstaff with flag in that war.
Aranya Kanda,28,23,That eye-pleasing golden flagstaff with flag is severally shattered and fell onto ground as if it is god-damned sun fallen on earth.
Aranya Kanda,28,24,"By that Khara is enraged, and as one who is aware of striking crucial parts/war tactics assaulted on the chest of Rama with four arrows, and even on other limbs, as one would prod an elephant with lancets."
Aranya Kanda,28,25,"Impacted with various arrows unloosened from the bow of Khara, limbs of Rama are drenched in blood and he became highly indignant."
Aranya Kanda,28,26,"On aiming his great bow that ablest one among archers, namely Rama, then in that war released six arrows targeting pointedly."
Aranya Kanda,28,27,"Rama indeed hit Khara's head with one arrow, with two his hands, and next with three crescent shaped arrows he hit his chest."
Aranya Kanda,28,28,"Then afterwards that great-resplendent Rama wishing to eliminate the demon, infuriately launched thirteen iron arrows that are sharply whetted and similar to the dazzle of sun."
Aranya Kanda,28,27,"That mighty Raghava who equals Indra in combats, smiling at the warfare of Khara, smashed the yoke of the chariot with one arrow; with four, four of the dappled horses; with the sixth, the head of the charioteer of Khara; with three, the three-pronged shaft from yoke to the base of chariot; with two the axels, thus that chariot is fragmented. Then, on wrecking Khara's bow on which an arrow is placed with the twelfth, that mighty one Rama impaled Khara with the thirteenth arrow that is similar to a thunderbolt. [4-28-29, 30, 31]"
Aranya Kanda,28,32,"With his bow utterly shattered, chariot fragmented, horses killed, and charioteer felled, that Khara then hopped down to ground from the dilapidated chariot wielding a mace, and stood fast."
Aranya Kanda,28,33,"The gods as well as great-sages have then came together and assembled in heavens, and those assemblies that are aboard their aircrafts are highly gladdened at the exploit of the great chariot-fighter Rama, and they worshipped him with their adjoined palms."
Aranya Kanda,29,1,"Rama, the great-resplendent, spoke these words forbiddingly albeit softly to Khara who lost his chariot but staying his course wielding a mace."
Aranya Kanda,29,2,"""Although you hold sway over a gigantic force abounding with elephants horses and chariots, you have perpetrated heinous deeds in Dandaka forests that are loathsome to all the worlds, that is unseemliest to this soldiery."
Aranya Kanda,29,3,"""One who causes suffering to living beings, besides being a transgressor and completely ruthless, he does not stand up for himself even if he were to be the lord of all the three worlds."
Aranya Kanda,29,4,"""All people will eliminate him, oh, nightwalker, who is imperious and an infringer of worldly routine, as they would eradicate a vicious serpent, in the event of its running across them."
Aranya Kanda,29,5,"""He who goes on performing evils selfishly, obsessively, heedlessly, more so delightedly, he will see the results of his own doings, like red-tailed-lizard on its eating self-destructive hailstones, obsessively and delightedly."
Aranya Kanda,29,6,"""The residents of Dandaka forest are the highly-propitious sages that tread the path of virtue, and oh, demon, what benefit you gain in killing them, really?"
Aranya Kanda,29,7,"""Even if a fortune is made for a lavish living with an iota of merit, the evildoers, that too reprobates, further more those that are abominated by world will not last long, no more that petrified tree trunks."
Aranya Kanda,29,8,"""One who undertakes evildoings will definitely and seasonably reap their fruits, which in his case will be ghoulish, as with the flowering of trees according to season."
Aranya Kanda,29,9,"""In the world one acquires the fruit of profane acts not before long, oh, nightwalker, and it will be like venomous food devoured."
Aranya Kanda,29,10,"""I am the king who arrived to exterminate the lives of those that perpetrate hideous sins, and even of those that wish to do evils to the disapprobation of world."
Aranya Kanda,29,10,"""I am the one who arrived at the behest of the king Dasharatha, or Bharata to exterminate the lives of those that perpetrate hideous sins, and even of those that wish to do evils to the disapprobation of world."
Aranya Kanda,29,11,"""Now, my arrows that are decorated in gold will be released on you like snakes rebounding from a snake-pit, and they will tear you asunder, and on riving you they will bounce back into my quivers."
Aranya Kanda,29,12,"""Now eliminated in war, you along with your army will tread behind those sages that were treading the path of virtue, on whom you have so far feasted in Dandaka forest."
Aranya Kanda,29,13,"""Let the supreme sages who were earlier slain by you may now see abiding on their aircrafts, your abidance in hellish death pangs when assaulted with my arrows."
Aranya Kanda,29,14,"""Attack me as you wish... make an effort... you the knave of your clan... now I am going to toss your head down like a palm-fruit..."" Thus Rama addressed Khara."
Aranya Kanda,29,15,"But when Rama said thus, Khara is infuriated and convulsed in anger, and he replied Rama with bloodshot eyes, laughing boisterously."
Aranya Kanda,29,16,"""On killing average demons in war, oh, son of Dasharatha, how you praise yourself when you yourself are un-praiseworthy?"" Thus Khara started to speak to Rama."
Aranya Kanda,29,17,"""Those best of men that are victorious and mighty will not boast anything, for they will be really proud of their own valour."
Aranya Kanda,29,18,"""Oh, Rama, as to how undignified Kshatriya-s that are frivolous and irresolute in self-confidence will boast in the world, likewise you too are boasting in a meaningless manner."
Aranya Kanda,29,19,"""Who will be that valiant that speaks about his lineage at wartime, that too, when the death-time is looming large! And, there will there be someone who broaches his self-extols in such an inopportune situation, is it!"
Aranya Kanda,29,20,"""Howsoever your ignominy is well shown by your self-praise, like the manifestation of gold on the tip of grass-blade burnt by fire, where the fire on grass-blade is no fire, and the bulb of fire appearing at the tip of grass-blade as a bulb of gold, is no gold."
Aranya Kanda,29,21,"""But you are seeing me wielding a mace and standing before you like an unshakable and jagged mountain laden with ores, isn't it!"
Aranya Kanda,29,22,"""As to how the Terminator wielding noose is enough to take away all the lives in all the three worlds, handling my mace I am enough for detracting your life from you."
Aranya Kanda,29,23,"""Even though much is to be said in your respect I will not continue to say, for the sun is getting at the dusk thereby disruption to war occurs."
Aranya Kanda,29,24,"""You have killed fourteen thousand demons and on killing you I will wipe the tears of the wives of those dead demons today itself."" Khara said so to Rama."
Aranya Kanda,29,25,"Saying thus that highly infuriated Khara hurled his mace towards Rama, around which there are superb golden cinctures, and which is extremely glaring like a thunderbolt."
Aranya Kanda,29,26,Forcefully discharged from Khara's hands that highly fiery and stupendous mace rendering trees and shrubs down to ashes darted towards Rama.
Aranya Kanda,29,27,"When that monstrous mace similar to the halter of the Terminator is swooping down, Rama smashed it to smithereens with his arrows while it is still sky rocketing."
Aranya Kanda,29,28,That mace splintered with arrows of Rama fell crumbling onto the surface of earth as a springing female snake would fall down by the strength of spells and nostrums.
Aranya Kanda,30,1,"On smashing the mace with arrows Raghava spoke this sentence to Khara smiling him out of temper, without assaulting weaponless and flustering Khara, because Rama is the patron of virtue following the protocol of righteous war."
Aranya Kanda,30,2,"""So, this is all the strength of yours and your army that is displayed and nothing more to display, is it! You wretched demon, it is paltriest compared to my strength, yet you vaunt aloud futilely!"
Aranya Kanda,30,3,"""This mace of yours in which you repose your bombastic aplomb, now completely battered with my arrows has gone onto the surface of earth, so also is your vanity."
Aranya Kanda,30,4,"""What that is said by you, 'I will dab the tears of the demons whose kinfolk are dead here...' even this word of yours is a fake."
Aranya Kanda,30,5,"""In boasting you are knavish, in character roguish, and in behaviour ghoulish, such a demon as you are, I will take your life away as the Divine Eagle Garuda took away Ambrosia."
Aranya Kanda,30,6,"""Now, my arrows will rip and chop off your throat, and then the earth will guzzle the blood gushed therefrom garnished with froth and foam."
Aranya Kanda,30,7,"""You will go to eternal sleep embracing the earth as you embrace an un-gainable lady, when both of your arms are knocked down to slide on earth, and limbs smeared with dirt."
Aranya Kanda,30,8,"""While you are in profound sleep, oh, notorious demon, this Dandaka forest becomes a shelter to the shelter-worthy sages and saints."
Aranya Kanda,30,9,"""When the strongholds of demons in your Janasthaana are ruined with my arrows, the sages in this forest will move about everywhere, fearlessly."
Aranya Kanda,30,10,"""The demonesses who terrorized others so far will be pitiably terrorised now, and they flee away very quickly with tear-wet faces as their kinsmen are killed."
Aranya Kanda,30,11,"""To which demonesses your kind of grievous demon is the husband, they must have taken birth in a befittingly grievous family like that of yours, and must be well-matched to you in grievous atrocities, and though they might not have tasted a grievous situation so far, since their lives have become meaningless, now they will become the enjoyers of the empathy of grief."
Aranya Kanda,30,12,"""You are atrocious in conduct because you countervail against Veda-s, debased by conscience because you counteract to Vedic rituals, and you are countermanding Vedic procedures because you have always been bothersome to Brahmans, and those Brahmans becoming sceptical of your deeds of hindrance, they are hesitatingly consigning oblations into Ritual-Fire, which are to be swiftly dropped into fire to the chants of hymns and even on time, hence you are countervailing against Veda-s and counteracting to their rituals, and countermanding their procedures."" Thus Rama spoke to Khara irefully."
Aranya Kanda,30,13,"While Raghava is speaking that way with such an impetuosity in that forest, Khara started to intimidate him rancorously in a voice stridulous than braying."
Aranya Kanda,30,14,"""Priding yourself resolutely you are unfearing even in a fearful situation, thereby you have indeed gone into the control of death, and for sure you are unmindful of what is speakable and what is not."" Thus, Khara started his tongue-lashing."
Aranya Kanda,30,15,"""Such of those men on whom the Lead of the Time verily closes in, they will not know what is to be done and what not, for all of their six senses will be rendered insensible."" Thus Khara intimidated Rama."
Aranya Kanda,30,16,"Saying so to Rama that nightwalker Khara then knitting his brows tightly saw everywhere for an assault weapon for use in that combat, and then he indeed found one not far away from him, namely a huge saala tree. [3-30-16, 17a]"
Aranya Kanda,30,17,"He curled his lips in frown and started to extricate that Saala tree, and that great-mighty Khara on forcefully uprooting that tree with both of hands hurled it aiming at Rama, braying loudly and shouting at him 'you are dead...' [3-30-17b, 18]"
Aranya Kanda,30,19,"But that adventurous Rama on shredding that tree which is swooping down with a torrent of arrows, and deciding to eliminate that Khara in that war evoked an unusual rancour, which rancour is equally an unusual facet of Rama."
Aranya Kanda,30,20,"Rama whose body is perspiring and whose eyes are acrimoniously bloodshot at ends, he utterly shredded Khara with a thousand arrows in that war."
Aranya Kanda,30,21,"Copious frothy blood gushed out from the gashes of arrows on the mountainous body of Khara, like the rapids on Mt. Prasavana, and it overflowed on earth too."
Aranya Kanda,30,22,When Khara is tormented with the arrows of Rama in that conflict he is bedevilled and with his blood stinking body he quickly bolted towards that Rama alone.
Aranya Kanda,30,23,"When Khara is descending on boisterously with his body bathed in blood, that adept one in the Science of Archery, dhanur veda , the scripture on archery, and that valorous Rama, in swiftness lurched a little...say, two or three steps..."
Aranya Kanda,30,24,"Then, Rama snatched an arrow which is similar to the Ritual-fire, and secondary only to the ultimate missile, namely the Brahma-missile, for the elimination of Khara in war."
Aranya Kanda,30,25,"That particular arrow is made available to Rama through Sage Agastya by the king of gods, namely Indra, because Indra is a sensible one about the future course of events, and he is also prosperous in securing impossible weaponry, and now Rama fitted such an arrow on his bow and released it towards Khara."
Aranya Kanda,30,26,"That formidable arrow is promptly released on Rama's stretching the bowstring up to his ear, bending bow almost to a circularity, and which arrow is thunderous while in egress like the thunder of a thunderbolt, and that has come and plunged inthe chest of Khara."
Aranya Kanda,30,27,"Khara fell down on to earth and on being burnt by the radiation of that arrow he is like demon Andhaka, who once was very completely burnt by Rudra in Shveta-araNya, the White-forest."
Aranya Kanda,30,28,"As with fall of demon Vritta or fall of demon Bala who are eliminated by Indra with his Thunderbolt, or as with the collapse of demon Namuchi who is eliminated by the same Indra just with forth or foam, Khara too is brought down."
Aranya Kanda,30,28,"In this meantime gods gathering along with carana-s drummed celestial drums from all over and showered flowers on Rama from all over. [3-30-29, 30a]"
Aranya Kanda,30,29,"And those gods and other celestials in their amazement said among themselves that 'in one and half hours, say seventy two minutes of this extreme crack-down Rama with his sharp arrows has eradicated fourteen thousand guise changing demons, including their chieftains Khara and Duushana. [3-30-30b, 31]"
Aranya Kanda,30,30,"""Aha! Surprising is this great deed of Rama, the shrewd-soul, what a valour, what a fortitude, really, his valour and fortitude are like those of Vishnu..."" Thus saying that way all of those gods have gone away as the have come. [3-30-32, 33a]"
Aranya Kanda,30,31,"All the kingly-sages and elite-sages along with Sage Agastya, who as incidentally came here to witness the victory of Rama, then on foregathering near at Rama delightedly said this on adoring him. [3-30-33b, 34a]"
Aranya Kanda,30,32,"""He that great-resplendent one, the controller of demon Paka, and the destroyer of enemy's cities, namely Indra, once came to the meritorious hermitage of Sage Sharabhanga only for the purpose such an elimination of demons. [3-30-34b, 35a]"
Aranya Kanda,30,33,"""For the purpose of eradicating these demons who are the evildoers by nature and the natural enemies to saintly people you are led to this countryside by the great sages with an ideation. [3-30-35b, 36a]"
Aranya Kanda,30,34,"""That which is the task of ours it is accomplished by you, oh, son of Dasharatha, now that Dandaka is unimpeded these great-sages will be practising their respective sacred devoirs in it."" Thus, the sages expressed their thanksgiving. [3-30-36b, 37a]"
Aranya Kanda,30,35,"In the meanwhile the brave Lakshmana exiting from the mountain cave came along with Seetha to their hermitage, and he is charmed at the victory of his brother Rama. [3-30-37b, 38a]"
Aranya Kanda,30,36,"And then that brave and victories Rama too came towards hermitage while great-sages reverenced him, and he entered the hermitage while Lakshmana came forward to greet him. [3-30-38b, 39a]"
Aranya Kanda,30,37,"And Seetha on seeing her husband, the eliminator of enemies and accorder of happiness to sages, embraced her husband Rama, rejoicingly. [3-30-39b, 40a]"
Aranya Kanda,30,40,"Janaka's daughter Seetha on seeing the hordes of demons eliminated, and even on observing her husband is also scatheless, she is all-smiles for him smiling sniggeringly."
Aranya Kanda,30,41,"She whose face is beaming with delight that Seetha, the daughter Janaka, on seeing Rama who has eliminated demonic troops, and whom great-sages are worshipping, again embraced him and became rapturous."
Aranya Kanda,31,1,This chapter is removed from the critical edition and retained by traditional versions There are discussions on this chapter whether it is the original work or an interpolated one. Some more details are given in the endnote. Akampana's character inevitably has continuity in the war scene at the end.
Aranya Kanda,31,1,Then on going hurriedly from Janasthaana and on speedily entering Lanka Akampana spoke these words to Ravana.
Aranya Kanda,31,2,"""Oh, king, many demons positioned in Janasthaana are killed, Khara is also killed in war, and somehow I have come here."
Aranya Kanda,31,3,"Thus said, then that ten-faced Ravana is infuriated with bloodshot eyes, and as though to burn down whole world with his radiance he spoke this to Akampana."
Aranya Kanda,31,4,"""Who is that dead-and-gone that has destroyed my indomitable Janasthaana? Who is it that has indeed opted for no recourse in all of the worlds?"
Aranya Kanda,31,5,"""Evoking indignation in me it is really impossible for Indra to be happy; even for Kubera - no; for Yama - no; why them, even Vishnu cannot be happy."
Aranya Kanda,31,6,"""I am the End-Time for the Time-god himself, I will burn down the Fire-god, and I am capable of conjoining Death with the virtue of deathliness."
Aranya Kanda,31,7,"""If I am enraged I will incinerate Sun-god or Fire-god just with my radiance, I will halt even the impetuosity of Wind-god with that of mine."" Thus Ravana said about himself."
Aranya Kanda,31,8,Akampana with his palms adjoined and voice hesitant with fear sought for the clemency of that decahedral demon Ravana who is enraged in that way.
Aranya Kanda,31,9,"When the supremo of demons Dasha-griiva pardoned him then that Akampana spoke these words, unfalteringly and trustfully."
Aranya Kanda,31,10,"""He is a youth whose shoulders are mighty, arms round and lengthy, built like that a lion, who is the son of Dasharatha and known as Rama."
Aranya Kanda,31,11,"""He is blue-black in complexion, a highly renowned one with matchless might and valour, a magnificent one such as he is he slew Duushana along with Khara in Janasthaana."""
Aranya Kanda,31,12,"On hearing the words of Akampana, the chief of demons Ravana, spoke these words hissing like a kingly serpent."
Aranya Kanda,31,13,"""The question is whether that Rama arrived at Janasthaana associated with Indra and along with all of the immortal gods? Oh, Akampana, speak about it."
Aranya Kanda,31,14,Akampana again detailed about the might and valour of that great souled Rama on hearing that sentence of Ravana.
Aranya Kanda,31,15,"""Rama means someone who is highly resplendent, an ablest archer among all archers, one who is endowed with divine missiles and divine attributes, and he is the one who conducts warfare with a supreme conduct."
Aranya Kanda,31,16,"""And a mighty one with redly eyes and drumbeat like voice, and whose face is shiny like the full-moon is Rama's selfsame younger brother known as Lakshmana."
Aranya Kanda,31,17,"""Alike the wind associating with fire this Lakshmana is associated with that glorious and nonpareil prince Rama, and that firestorm, namely Rama, destroyed Janasthaana."
Aranya Kanda,31,18,"""They are not any great souled gods or any heavenly beings as such, hence there is no need to doubt about it. Rama unloosened his gold-finned and feather-winged arrows, which on becoming five-faced serpents started consuming the demons."
Aranya Kanda,31,19,"""To whichever nook those demons smitten by fear of those serpent-like are fleeing, they have seeing Rama alone standing afore them in that corner, and oh, merited king Ravana, in this way your Janasthaana is totally ruined by that Rama. [3-31-19b, 20]"
Aranya Kanda,31,21,"On hearing the words of Akampana Ravana said these words, ""I will to go to Janasthaana to kill Rama along with Lakshmana."""
Aranya Kanda,31,22,"When Ravana said so then Akampana said these words in reply, "" listen, oh, king, what all has happened, and of what in actuality is Rama's spirit and grit."
Aranya Kanda,31,23,"""Rama, the highly renolwned, is invincible just by braving against him, for that Rama in fury can stall the onrush of a plethoric river with his arrows."
Aranya Kanda,31,24,"""That magnificent Rama can collapse even the firmament along with its starlets, stars and planets, and he even can elevate the earth if it were to collapse."
Aranya Kanda,31,25,"""On breaching the shoreline of the ocean with his arrows that lord Rama can deluge worlds, and he can stem the tide of turbulent ocean, or can even stall the agent of that turbulence, namely the wind."
Aranya Kanda,31,26,"""That great valorous and the ablest among humans is capable to destroy all the worlds with his valour, and even capable of creating the people again."
Aranya Kanda,31,26,"Or, again dissolving all the worlds into himself, that great contemplator who transcends all is even capable of creating the creation again from out of him."
Aranya Kanda,31,27,"""Oh, Dashagriiva, it is impossible to conquer that Rama in war for your, either singly or along with the hosts of the demon-supporters of yours, as one heaven cannot be won by many sinners."
Aranya Kanda,31,28,"""I do not think that he is killable even for all god and demons, and this is the idea to kill him, and to this you may listen attentively."
Aranya Kanda,31,29,"""An excellent woman in the world is there, a youthful one with symmetrical limbs, a jewel-like lady adorned with jewellery, that slender-waisted one who is known as Seetha is his wife."
Aranya Kanda,31,30,"""No goddess can be likened to that mature lady; a gandharva female - no; a apsara female - no; a pannaga female -no, then how can there be a woman of her like?"
Aranya Kanda,31,31,"""You forcefully abduct his wife when she is in solitude, and indeed Rama will not exist reft of Seetha."" Akampana advised Ravana in this way."
Aranya Kanda,31,32,The chief of demons Ravana favouring that idea thought of it and that mighty armed Ravana then spoke to Akampana.
Aranya Kanda,31,33,"""Agreed! I wish to go alone early in the morning with a charioteer and I delightfully wish to lead Vaidehi into the elegant city Lanka."" Ravana declared that way."
Aranya Kanda,31,34,"Saying so Ravana journeyed in a chariot that is yoked with mule-like horses, and that has the dazzling of the sun, whereby all the directions are made to glitter."
Aranya Kanda,31,35,That opalescent chariot of the lord of demons while speedily progressing through starry way shone forth as if it is the moon in clouds.
Aranya Kanda,31,36,On going to the hermitage of Maareecha which is at a distant place Maareecha the son of Tataka received Ravana and venerated that king of demons with sweetmeats and savouries that are unavailable to humans.
Aranya Kanda,31,37,Offering proper seat and water for washing feet and hands Maareecha personally attended Ravana and spoke to him this sentence that is worded meaningfully.
Aranya Kanda,31,38,"""Oh, king and supremo of demons, I am anxious to know whether everything safe and secure to the inhabitants of your kingdom, for I am not in the know of the reason by which now you have come here rushingly."
Aranya Kanda,31,39,When Maareecha said so to him that greatly radiant one who is a sententious speaker that Ravana thereafter spoke this sentence.
Aranya Kanda,31,40,"""Oh, sire, Rama who is indefatigable in warring has ruined my security stationed at Janasthaana, and in war he even brought down all of Janasthaana which is undefeatable so far, such as I am, to me you have to render friendly help in kidnapping Rama's wife."""
Aranya Kanda,31,42,"On hearing the words of that chief of demons, Maareecha spoke these words, ""who broached the subject of Seetha with you, an enemy in the fakery of a friend? Oh, tigerly demon, who is that censurable one that is unhappy with you, since he is giving such a self-ruinous advise?"
Aranya Kanda,31,43,""" 'Seetha may be brought to Lanka...' who said it, say him to me, who is that one desiring to cut off the prominence of all the demons in all worlds in saying so?"
Aranya Kanda,31,44,"""Who is desirous of getting a zenithal demon ruling all the three worlds to be cut-off when he said that Seetha shall be brought to Lanka?"
Aranya Kanda,31,43,"""Who is saying that Seetha is to be brought to Lanka with a desire to get your apogeal ten-heads that are prominent among all the clansmen of demons to be cut-off?"
Aranya Kanda,31,44,"""Also, he who has motivated you in this way is an undoubted enemy of yours, for he wanted to extricate the fangs of a snake from its mouth, of course, through you."
Aranya Kanda,31,45,"""By whom and by which purpose of his you are made to blunder upon this awry path, oh, king, it is as good as his hitting hard on your head while you are fast asleep."
Aranya Kanda,31,46,"""Oh, Ravana, it will be unbefitting to raise an eye to see Rama in war, who will be then like a majestic elephant that has an impeccable dynasty and bloodline as its mammoth trunk, personal radiance as its indomitable might, very firm pair of arms as its pernicious tusks, more so, who will be with the redolence of the irrepressible lineage of Raghava-s."
Aranya Kanda,31,47,"""To be in the midst of war itself is the fury of that lion called Rama, by which that lion raises its tail touching the back of its trunk, that lion is all-inclusive with forelegs, paws, and claws that are included in arrows, while its fangs are swords, and it is the killer of the deer called the expert killer-demons, and mind you, do not dare to rouse that sleeping man-lion."
Aranya Kanda,31,48,"""His bow is crocodilian, his shoulder-speed is quagmire, his arrows are tidal, and the great immensity of his war itself is a tideland, and oh, king of demons, it is inapt of you to slide down into the much-ghoulish mouth of that abyssal ocean, called Rama."
Aranya Kanda,31,49,"""Oh, lord of Lanka, be appeased towards Rama, be quietened and gently proceed to Lanka. You take delight in your wives, and let Rama be delighting with wife in forests."" Thus Mareecha spoke to Ravana."
Aranya Kanda,31,50,When thus said by Maareecha that ten faced Ravana returned to his city Lanka and entered his best house and home.
Aranya Kanda,32,1,"On seeing the fourteen thousands demons of heinous crimes, and even on seeing Trishira, Duushana, and even Khara, who are all exterminated by lone Rama, then Shuurpanakha emitted a thunderous blare like a thundercloud. [3-32-1, 2]"
Aranya Kanda,32,3,"Highly agitated to witness the deed done by Rama, which deed is highly impossible for others, she hurried Lanka ruled by Ravana."
Aranya Kanda,32,4,"She saw Ravana who is fulgent with his own radiance, seated with ministers at his nearby in the midst of the divine aircraft Pushpaka, as with Indra who will be sitting amidst wind-gods."
Aranya Kanda,32,5,"Seated similar to the Sun in firmament on a supreme golden throne, which resembles a golden Altar of Fire, and he himself resembling the blazing Ritual-fire spurting out of it when that Golden-Fire-Altar is drenched with plentiful ghee, she saw such a Ravana."
Aranya Kanda,32,6,"An invincible one either for gods or gandharva-s, or to sages with exalted souls, or even to any other entity worth its name, whose appearance itself is catastrophic, and who is sitting identical to the Terminator, as though that Terminator himself is sitting with a wide gaped mouth, at such a Ravana Shuurpanakha saw."
Aranya Kanda,32,7,"One who is severally bruised in several combats of gods and demons with the thunderbolts from the Vajra weapon of Indra, and one who is severally blotched on his chest when the prongs of the tusks of Airavata, the lordly elephant of Indra, gored his chest, at such a Ravana Shuurpanakha saw."
Aranya Kanda,32,8,"One who has twenty arms, ten faces and a broad chest, and a possessor of all regalia of Indra like white parasol, white fanning instruments, colours and the like insigne, and at that brave one who is attributed with all of the kingly attributes, Shuurpanakha saw."
Aranya Kanda,32,9,"Blent with the gleam of Lapis gems studded in his ornaments his glisten is alike that gem, while his ear-knobs are made out of refined gold, and his arms strongish, teeth whitish, mouth widish and he is mountainous, and Shuurpanakha saw such a Ravana."
Aranya Kanda,32,10,"His body bears hundreds of welts caused when assaulted with Vishnu-disc for hundreds of times in wars with gods, and when assaulted for hundreds of times with the other assaults-missiles in other gruesome wars as well, and Shuurpanakha saw at such a Ravana."
Aranya Kanda,32,11,"Likewise, whose limbs are thrashed with thrashing missilery of all gods, whereby his body and soul have become harsh, thus he can perpetrate anything swiftly at his will, and he who can capably roil an un-perturbable ocean at his wish, at such Ravana Shuurpanakha saw."
Aranya Kanda,32,12,"At him who is a volleyer of mountain peaks, a represser of gods, an extirpator of ethical values, and a molester of others wives, Shuurpanakha saw."
Aranya Kanda,32,12,"He who is a marksman of every divine missile, and an ever interdictor of Vedic-rituals, and who on going to the city named Bhogavati, the capital of Naga-s, and on defeating Vaasuki, the King of Serpents, has abducted the dear wife of Taksha on molesting her, and Shuurpanakha saw such a molester of others wives. [3-32-13, 14a]"
Aranya Kanda,32,13,"On going to Mt. Kailash he who has defeated the god who uses humans as his vehicle, namely Kubera, and snatched away his aircraft, namely Pushpaka, which aircraft transits at the wish of its steersman, and Shuurpanakha saw such a grabber of others possessions. [3-32-14b, 15a]"
Aranya Kanda,32,14,"He who enviously devastated the divine gardens of Kubera, called Caitraratha, along with a divine Lake of Lotuses pertaining to the same Kubera, called Pushkarini, and the gardens of Indra, called Nandana, along with other paradisiacal gardens of gods, Shuurpanakha saw such an envious demon. [3-32-15b, 16a]"
Aranya Kanda,32,15,"Shuurpanakha saw him who is similar to the pinnacle of a mountain, and who with his two hands forestalls the highly propitious ones and stiflers of their enemies, namely the Sun and Moon, when they tend to rise. [3-32-16b, 17a]"
Aranya Kanda,32,16,"That courageous one who in early times has practised ascesis for ten thousand years in a great-forest, and who on accomplishing it has dedicated ten of his heads to the Self-Created Brahma, she saw such a Ravana with such ten heads. [3-32-17b, 18a]"
Aranya Kanda,32,17,"Whereby, to whom there is an indemnity against death in war at the hand of gods, demons, gandharva-s, devils, birds, or reptiles, excepting humans, and Shuurpanakha saw such an unimperilled Ravana. [3-32-18b, 19a]"
Aranya Kanda,32,18,"He who is an extreme-ultraist that expropriates the Soma-juice-oblation form the vessels of oblation in Vedic-rituals, which Soma juice-oblation is blest with Vedic-hymns and kept separately by Vedic Brahmans, since it is intended and shall belong to Indra and other divinities, and she saw such a plunderer. [3-32-19b, 20a]"
Aranya Kanda,32,19,"He who is such an embezzler of the Vedic-rituals at the time of their culmination, a malicious one, and one with cruel acts, a hinderer of Vedic-rituals, or, the slayer of those Brahmans that conduct Vedic-rituals contrary to his wishes, and one who is heartless and a rampant demon, who is a delighter in the iniquity to the people, at him Shuurpanakha saw. [3-32-20b, 21a]"
Aranya Kanda,32,20,"She that demoness Shuurpanakha saw her brother who makes all beings to wail, an alarming one to all the worlds, an atrocious one and highly formidable Ravana. [3-32-21b, 22a]"
Aranya Kanda,32,21,"And at him who is conspicuously sitting on a throne, attired and bejewelled in excellent apparels and jewels, shining forth with marvellous garlands, and who is like the Ultimate-Time on the rise destined for the Eventual-Time. [3-32-22b, 23a]"
Aranya Kanda,32,22,"Demoness Shuurpanakha nearing Ravana, who is the highly fortunate king of demons, an enemy-destroyer and a felicity of the dynasty of Sage Pulasta, and who is now surrounded by his ministers, she spoke this sentence. [3-32-23b, 24]"
Aranya Kanda,32,25,"She who is disfigured by the high souled Lakshmana, and who is still perplexed with the fear of Lakshmana and her own craving for Rama as well, on displaying her misfortune to everybody that fearless rover Shuurpanakha spoke this very caustic sentence to Ravana, whose eyes are broad and burning."
Aranya Kanda,33,1,"This chapter vies with the 33rd chapter of Kishkindha Kanda in the attitudes of a king and his kingship. These two chapters, as detailed by ancient commentators, equally deal with raaja niiti shastra 'political science' and there in Kishkindha the only rescue to Sugreeva is Tara, who saves the face of Sugreeva before Lakshmana, whereas in here Ravana has none to come to his aid when chided by Shuurpanakha. Though Shuurpanakha is a sultry and harpy demoness, the Sage Valmiki has put some rational words on her tongue in forewarning Ravana."
Aranya Kanda,33,1,Then that doleful Shuurpanakha spoke these scornful words to Ravana who makes the world to wail in the presence of his ministers.
Aranya Kanda,33,2,"""Highly infatuated with lustful gratifications you are incontinent and unchecked, thus you are unobservant of a calamitous jeopardy that has surfaced, though you ought to be observant of it as a king."
Aranya Kanda,33,3,"""If a king deports himself in an overly self-assured manner, that too with self-serving motives, and clings only to dirty pleasures, he will be unhonoured by people as with a crematory fire."
Aranya Kanda,33,4,"""The king who will not deal with the concerns of kingdom, in person and on time, he and his kingdom and even those concerns of his kingdom will get ruined."
Aranya Kanda,33,5,"""If a king is inaccessible to spies for exchange of information, unavailable for subjects for an audience for a similar appraisal, more so if he is intemperately not able to impose self-discipline, people will eschew such a king from a distance as elephants will refrain themselves from the mud of river from a distance."
Aranya Kanda,33,6,"""Which of those kings that will not safeguard their kingdoms by remaining in a self-restrained manner, they will not outshine advantageously, like mountains submerged under ocean."
Aranya Kanda,33,8,"""Without keeping the kingdom under your personal control, you have shuffled the administration onto the ministers and army personnel like Khara, Duushana et al. And these figureheads alone become the tiderips, for they quarrel among themselves about the kingship of Lanka after your ruin, and they alone are floating like oceanic tides up above your head and thus you are a submerged sovereign. In any way, your doom is destined either by Rama, who is an imminent danger, or by your military managers, who are the in-built dangers."""
Aranya Kanda,33,7,"""Externally you are belligerent with sensible gods, gandharva-s and other demons, and internally you are needful of intelligence agents, and such as you are, you are an erratic even, then how can you thrive as a king!"
Aranya Kanda,33,8,"""Your bent is boyish and you are mindless, oh, demon, you are not able to know the knowable danger because you are carefree, and how do you thrive as a king!"
Aranya Kanda,33,9,"""Oh, so-called best one among triumphant kings, those kings that do not retain spies, treasuries and strategies under their control, but vouchsafe them to others, they are of a piece with the peasantry."
Aranya Kanda,33,10,"""Oh, titular overlord of humans, only some can be called prescient kings because they see all the situations happening distantly through their spies."
Aranya Kanda,33,11,"""I believe that you have no spies worth their profession, yet you are associated with artless ministers worthy to worship you, hence you are incognisant of the ruination of all of your subjects in Janasthaana, including Janasthaana."
Aranya Kanda,33,12,"""A single soul called Rama has eliminated fourteen thousand demons of dreadful deeds in Janasthaana, even Duushana is killed, even Khara is also killed."
Aranya Kanda,33,13,"""That indefatigable champion Rama gave security to the sages, rendered Dandaka forest safeguarded, and he put Janasthaana to rout."
Aranya Kanda,33,14,"""On your part you are but selfish, hotheaded, and others like the appeasers of your lust, or these artless ministers, or those underpaid unfaithful spies hold you down, and such as you are, you are unperceptive of the calamity rising up against you in your own kingdom."
Aranya Kanda,33,15,"""Should a king be overweening, an under-payer, an improvident, self-conceited, and dubious, all his subjects bid goodbye to such a king when he is in strife."
Aranya Kanda,33,16,"""Should a ruler be unduly self-conceited, self-centred, self-adulating and a spitfire too, his own kith and kin will ruin him when he is in distress."
Aranya Kanda,33,17,"""That king who does not officiate his good offices, nor un-panicked into panicky situations, he will be quickly overthrown from his kingdom, and on becoming a debased individual he will be equated with a piece of straw in this world."
Aranya Kanda,33,18,"""Dried sticks, globs or the particles of dust are of some avail, but kings fallen from their position are of no avail."
Aranya Kanda,33,19,"""As to how a used up raiment or a crumpled flower-tassel is meaningless, likewise a king derelict from his kingdom, though functional, is meaningless."
Aranya Kanda,33,20,"""Which king will be cautious, clever, conscientious, with his controlled senses, and thankful, that king survives for a long time."
Aranya Kanda,33,23,"""He who keeps his mental eyes of wariness will be wakeful even though he slept well closing his physical eyes and he who will make his fury and favour evident to people without any concealment or cunningness, people will highly revere him as a king."
Aranya Kanda,33,21,"""He who keeps his mental eyes of wariness wakeful even though he sleeps fast closing his physical eyes, thus discarded are his fury and frenzy as well, because he knows as to who is to be treated furiously and who is to be favoured, and thus people will revere him as a judicious king."
Aranya Kanda,33,22,"""But, oh, Ravana, because you are imprudent you are bereft of these merits, and such as you are, unknown is the very great massacre of demons to you, though not personally, but at least through your spies."
Aranya Kanda,33,23,"""You are the humiliator of others, you hobnob only with your ravishes, and incognisant of the object for apportionment of time and place for your activities, as to when and where and how the things are to be dealt with. And, as you are not attending any kingly activity, or do not focus your mind in deciding rights and wrongs, thereby your kingdom will get ruined and you will be imperilled, not before long."" Thus Shuurpanakha declaimed Ravana about his worthlessness as a king."
Aranya Kanda,33,24,"In this way when Shuurpanakha extolled only his negative traits, he that lord of night-walkers Ravana, who holds only his pride, power and prosperity dear to him, pored them over in his mind and contemplated over a time."
Aranya Kanda,34,1,On observing Shuurpanakha who is speaking bitter words against him in the presence of ministers then Ravana is highly infuriated and queried her.
Aranya Kanda,34,2,"""Who is Rama? How brave he is? Of what mien and what calibre he is? And for what reason he entered the highly inscrutable Dandaka forest?"
Aranya Kanda,34,3,"""What is the weapon of that Rama by whom these many demons are killed in war, likewise Duushana and Trishira are killed, and even the unkillable Khara is killed? Oh, lady with fascinating limbs, who disfigured you? That you tell. [1-34-3, 4a]"
Aranya Kanda,34,4,"When the king of demons has asked her thus, she that demoness Shuurpanakha who is in a fit of fury then commenced to describe Rama in the point of fact. [3-34-4b, 5a]"
Aranya Kanda,34,5,"""Dasharatha's son Rama is the one with inescapable arms and keen-eyed, but has jute-cloths and skin of black-deer for his dress, yet in semblance he is similar to the Love-god. [3-34-5b, 6a]"
Aranya Kanda,34,6,"""Yanking out a bow with golden fillets, and that is similar to the bow of Indra in its shine, he strews candent iron-arrows that simulate snakes with deadly poison. [3-34-6b, 7a]"
Aranya Kanda,34,7,"""It has become imperceivable for me to me to see when and how he drew his ghastly arrows from quiver on the battleground; or, stretching his bow admitting those arrows on bowstring - no; or, his releasing those sharp edged arrows from the bow - no; why them, that great mighty Rama himself has become imperceptible in the fastness of his action. [3-34-7b, 8a]"
Aranya Kanda,34,8,"""As with a crop of grain devastated by a hailstorm of Indra, I could only see that best army while it is being annihilated with a downpour of arrows. [3-34-8b, 9a]"
Aranya Kanda,34,9,"""Thus a lone foot-soldier with his excruciating arrows has exterminated fourteen thousand demons with fiendish might, including Duushana, and along withKhara, say, within one and half hours. [3-34-9b,10]"
Aranya Kanda,34,10,"""Accorded is the protection to the sages, and Dandaka is made as a snuggest place for them. I am the lone one somehow let off by such a high-minded Rama, of course, on humiliating me by cutting my nose and ears. Maybe, it is because he is hesitant of woman-slaughter for he is a well-versed soul. [1-34-11, 12]"
Aranya Kanda,34,13,"""A highly resplendent one who by his trait matches his brother in bravery, an adherent and a devotee of his brother, such a stout-hearted one is Rama's brother known as Lakshmana."
Aranya Kanda,34,14,"""That Lakshmana is an easily irritable one, he is not that easily invincible, an easy victor, but not an easygoing valiant, yet he is an intellectual at ease, and a mighty one who does not ease off, such a Lakshmana is the perpetual right-hand and the peripherally moving life of Rama."
Aranya Kanda,34,15,"""But, one with her broad-eyes, face similar to the full-moon is the dear and wedded wife of Rama, and she always takes delight in the well-being of her dear one, namely Rama."
Aranya Kanda,34,16,"""She is the one with lengthy hairdo, her nose and thighs are fine, and that glorious one with fine looks is the wife of Rama, and she is beaming forth like a sylvan deity situated in that woodland, who in turn is like Goddess Lakshmi in a temporal form."
Aranya Kanda,34,17,"""She has a complexion mathing the shade of refined gold, her nails are rosy and jutting, and she with her curvaceous hips and slim waist is the daughter of King of Videha, and known as Seetha."
Aranya Kanda,34,18,"""So far I have not seen any goddess with such a comeliness; a gandharva female - no; a yaksha female - no; a kinnara female - no; and a woman, no, not on the face of earth!"
Aranya Kanda,34,19,"""To whom Seetha becomes a wife and around whom she gladly throws her arms after such a marriage, he lives more grandly than Indra in all the worlds."
Aranya Kanda,34,20,"""She is a highly gracious lady, laudable by her bodily structure, incomparable by her appearance, and she will become a seemly wife of yours, and you too will become a best husband of hers."
Aranya Kanda,34,19,"""Oh, mighty shouldered brother, but when I ventured to bring her as your wife, whose hips are broad, bosom fat and bulgy, face excellent, that cruel Lakshmana disfigured me. [1-34-21, 22a]"
Aranya Kanda,34,20,"""You too will become a groveller at the arrows Lover-god in case you now see Vaidehi with a face shining like full-moon. [1-34-22, 23a]"
Aranya Kanda,34,23,"""Hence, if you hatch an opinion to make her as your wife, and if you aspire success, now itself quickly put your best foot, namely your right foot, forward."
Aranya Kanda,34,24,"""Oh, the king of demons Ravana, if this advise of mine is pleasing to you, let this idea be actualised without any shilly-shallying in your mind."
Aranya Kanda,34,25,"""Oh, king of the demons, realise your stout-heartedness, and oh, great mighty one, let that immaculately limbed Seetha be abducted to become your wife."
Aranya Kanda,34,26,"""On recognising that Rama with his straight shooting arrows destroyed the night-walkers positioned at Janasthaana, and further on distinguishing that Duushana, and even Khara, is dispatched, it is apt of you to awake to a workable action."" Thus Shuurpanakha has earbashed Ravana."
Aranya Kanda,35,1,"On hearing the exciting advise of Shuurpanakha then Ravana bade adieu to ministers, and indeed on resolving his further task he proceeded to his personal palace chambers."
Aranya Kanda,35,2,"While following up his thinking about that task he got a pertinent thought, and on deliberating about the credits and discredits, strengths and weaknesses of that thought he decided that 'this is to be done in this method only.' On taking a decision in that way and with a firm mind he indeed proceeded to his excellent vehicle-garage. [3-35-2, 3]"
Aranya Kanda,35,4,"That lordly demon then has gone to the vehicle garage in secrecy, and directed the charioteer thus as, 'let the chariot be harnessed.'"
Aranya Kanda,35,5,When that brisk-paced charioteer is said in this way he instantly harnessed the favourite and choicest chariot of Ravana with horses and got it ready.
Aranya Kanda,35,5,"That chariot which is decorated with golden ornaments, yoked with monster-faced mules that have gem studded trappings is rideable by the wish of the rider, and sitting in such a chariot which is wholly golden and which rides with a sound like the pealing of thunder, that celebrated Ravana, the brother of Kubera and the lord of demons, travelled towards the lord of rivers and rivulets, namely the ocean. [3-35-6,7]"
Aranya Kanda,35,6,"Dasha-aanana, the decahedral demon, whose complexion like the smoothened Lapis-gem is lustrous, whose regalia that comprise white long-furred fans, white parasol and the like is spectacular, whose ornaments made out of refined gold are glittering, who similar to a kingly mountain with ten pinnacles and crags by way of his ten heads and twenty arms is gorgeous, and such a chief of demons who by that way is an adversary of gods and cutthroat of eminent-sages, seated in a nitid golden chariot that is rideable by the wish of its steersman, he shone forth like a black-cloud fringed with the streaks of lightning and rimmed with flights of cranes. [3-35-8, 9, 10]"
Aranya Kanda,35,11,That dauntless Ravana forged ahead while viewing the area along the coastline which is interspersed with thousands of mountains and which is with variously flowered and fruited trees.
Aranya Kanda,35,12,"Everywhere the coastland is bedecked with lotus-lakes containing clean and cool waters, and with extensive thresholds of hermitages containing Fire-altars."
Aranya Kanda,35,13,"Entire coast is gleaming with banana plantation and glistening with coconut trees, and the saala, palm, and tamaala trees are also in full blossom."
Aranya Kanda,35,10,"It is brightened up with thousands of reptiles and birds, with those many celestial beings that frequent the earth like gandharva-s, kinnaraa-s. And with eminent sages who have highly controlled food-habits, as well. It is also refulgent with the self-denying Siddha-s, Carana-s, and with sages that are the brainchildren of Brahma, namely Vaikhanasa-s, Maasha-s, Vaalakhilya-s, Mariicipa-s. [3-35-14, 15]"
Aranya Kanda,35,16,"With thousands of celestial maidens divine in their mien, namely apsara-s, who are prettified with divine ornaments and garlands, and who are also the experts in the methodical sex-games that seaside is pervaded."
Aranya Kanda,35,17,"That seacoast is adored by the propitious wives of gods and frequented by the assemblages of gods who thrive upon ambrosia, and even patronised by demons that strive for ambrosia."
Aranya Kanda,35,18,"It is spread with swans, ruddy-gees and frogs, and there the waterfowls are very noisy, and stones overlain on the coast are like lapis-gems, and with the ambience of ocean that whole delta is appearing smooth and sludgy."
Aranya Kanda,35,14,"While Ravana, the brother of Kubera, is quickly transiting he saw everywhere the whitish and widish aircrafts belonging to the deified souls who acquired higher worlds, and from those aircrafts adorned with divine flowery tassels and piloted by the wish of their steersmen, instrumental and vocal music is resonating, and gandharva-s are singing and apsara-s are dancing in them. [3-35-19, 20]"
Aranya Kanda,35,21,"Ravana proceeded while observing thousands of woodlands with sandalwood trees that are soothing and satisfying the sense of smell, and that oozed sweet-smelling resin at their bases."
Aranya Kanda,35,22,"He also observed on his way the forests and woodlands containing the noteworthy aloe plants, Takkola trees, and the nutmeg trees that are with fruits and aromatic, as well."
Aranya Kanda,35,23,"Also seen are the flowers of Tamaala trees, shrubberies of pepper, and heaps of desiccating pearl-oysters along the seashore."
Aranya Kanda,35,24,"Thus, he saw the peaking boulders, like that the reefs of corals, and like that also at the mountains that have golden and silvern crests."
Aranya Kanda,35,19,"On seeing the delightful, serene, and marvellous cascades, and cities that are abundant in wealth and agricultural produce, and abundant with gemlike womenfolk, and that are replete with elephants, horses, and chariots, Ravana proceeded further. [3-35-25, 26a]"
Aranya Kanda,35,20,"Ravana observed the delta adjacent to seacoast of that kingly ocean to be uniform and smooth, while the light air breezing in there is soft for touch, thus it looked heavenly. [3-35-26b, 27a]"
Aranya Kanda,35,21,"There Ravana also saw a banyan tree which in sheen is like a black-cloud, and the branches of which are stretching all over for a hundred yojana-s in length, and on which sages made their abode for practising ascesis. [3-35-27b, 28a]"
Aranya Kanda,35,22,"This is the tree on the branch of which once highly mighty Divine Eagle Garuda swooped to perch, clawing an elephant and a mammoth tortoise, for the purpose of dining them out on that tree-branch. [3-35-28b, 29a]"
Aranya Kanda,35,23,"While descending rapidly then that best bird among birds Garuda suddenly broke that tree's branch which is full with leaves, owing to the impact of his high impetuosity. [3-35-29b, 30a]"
Aranya Kanda,35,24,"Adhering to that tree-branch there are eminent sages like, Vaikhanasa-s, Maasha-s, Vaalakhilya-s, Mariicipa-s, Aja-s, and even sages like Dhuumraa-s that thrive on fumes and smokes are there, and there they are collectively practising asceticism upside down while clasping branches with their legs. [3-35-30b, 31a]"
Aranya Kanda,35,25,"For the sake of the grace of those sages Garuda took flight from that tree, grasping that broken tree-branch of a hundred yojana length along with those pendulous sages with his beak, and both of the elephant and tortoise with both of his claws. [3-35-31b, 32a]"
Aranya Kanda,35,26,"That virtue-souled Garuda consumed the meat of his prays, namely the elephant and the giant tortoise with a single foot, and destroyed the province of tribesmen with the same broken tree branch, and thus that supreme bird Garuda gained an incomparable happiness in rescuing those great-sages. [3-35-32b, 33]"
Aranya Kanda,35,34,When his valour has become twice as much with that happiness that heedful Garuda indeed resolved to bring ambrosia from heaven.
Aranya Kanda,35,35,"Smashing the guard of iron-grid completely and crashing the unbreakable diamond -like strongroom in which the ambrosia is safeguarded, then Garuda carried off ambrosia from the palace of Indra."
Aranya Kanda,35,36,"Ravana on his way saw such a banyan tree named as Subhadra which is a much sought after tree for assemblages of great sages, and which betokens the deeds of that best-winged Garuda."
Aranya Kanda,35,37,"On going to the other side of the lord of rivers, namely ocean, Ravana saw a pleasing hermitage in the sacred and scenic interior of the forest."
Aranya Kanda,35,38,"At that place Ravana saw the demon named Maareecha, wearing jute-clothes and black deerskin and tufts of hairs, and the one with regulated diet."
Aranya Kanda,35,39,That demon Maareecha welcomed the king Ravana and customarily entertained him catering all the offerings that are beyond the scope of humans.
Aranya Kanda,35,40,"On personally offering meals and drinking water, and venerating him properly Maareecha spoke this sentence to Ravana which is connotative of significance."
Aranya Kanda,35,41,"""Oh, king of the demons, is everything well with your Lanka? Oh, king, for what reason you have put in an appearance again, that too in a trice?"
Aranya Kanda,35,42,"When Maareecha spoke to him thus, that highly radiant and eloquent Ravana then afterwards spoke this sentence to Maareecha."
Aranya Kanda,36,1,"""Give attention to my words as I speak, oh, sire, Maareecha, I am an anguished one, and when I am in such an anguish you are the ultimate course to me, isn't so."" Thus Ravana started addressing Maareecha."
Aranya Kanda,36,2,"""You are aware as to how my brother Khara, and the mighty armed Duushana, also my sister Shuurpanakha, and even the highly fiery demon and devourer of raw-flesh Trishira, and even numerous other night-walking demons who are cocksure of hitting their targets have made Janasthaana as their residency, and while residing there they put the sages of that great forest that tread a righteous path to torture, of course, all this as assigned by me. [3-36-2, 3, 4]"
Aranya Kanda,36,5,"""You are equally aware of the stationing fourteen thousand braving demons in Janasthaana, who are the followers of the wish of Khara, who are with fiendish exploits, and who are the troublemakers to the sages of Dandaka forest or to the intruders therein, aren't you."
Aranya Kanda,36,4,"""But recently those great mighty demons that are the residents of Janasthaana, namely Khara and others, preparing themselves inordinately and wielding diverse weapons and assaulters, for their part had an encounter with Rama in a combat. [3-36-6, 7a]"
Aranya Kanda,36,5,"""With rancour tiding in him, and without making any scathing remark in the least, that Rama brought his bow into play with arrows in the van of the combat. [3-36-7b, 8a]"
Aranya Kanda,36,6,"""But that foot-soldier, that too, a human, has completely wiped out those fourteen-thousand demons with flaring fieriness with his fierce arrows. [3-36-8b, 9a]"
Aranya Kanda,36,7,"""Khara is hewed down, Duushana is mowed down, and even Trishira is hacked down, thereof that Dandaka forest is rendered free from the fear of demons. [3-36-9b, 10a]"
Aranya Kanda,36,8,"""He who is put to flight by his infuriated father, and who came to Dandaka forest along with his wife, that ignoble Kshatriya is the slaughterer of that demonic army of mine, as his lifespan is diminished. [3-36-10b, 11a]"
Aranya Kanda,36,9,"""He is out of character, brutal, firestorm, senseless, selfish, one with his senses unconquered and righteousness discarded, and he is an unrighteous soul just delighting in the disservice of all beings. [3-36-11b, 12a]"
Aranya Kanda,36,10,"""By whom my sister is disfigured stripping off her nose and ears, that too, without any enmity but just depending upon his own brawn, I would like to inveigle such a man's nymphean wife Seetha holding sway on her in Janasthaana, and in that matter I want you to be my aide in Dandaka forest. [3-36-12b, 13, 14a]"
Aranya Kanda,36,11,"""Oh, highly powerful Maareecha, with you and with my brothers standing by my side as my associates, I indeed care a damn for all of the gods if they are going to wage a war against me, therefore, oh, demon Maareecha, as you are capable of rendering aid you should indeed become my aide in this venture. [3-36-14b, 15]"
Aranya Kanda,36,16,"""In valour, war and verve there is none similar to you, you are a topmost stalwart in trickery, and a matchless expert in illusive-tricks."
Aranya Kanda,36,17,"""I have come nigh of you only for that reason, oh, nightwalker, and listen to that deed which you have to do in the course of helping me as I detail you."
Aranya Kanda,36,18,"""On becoming an astounding golden deer with silver dots, you move in front of Seetha in the hermitage of that Rama."
Aranya Kanda,36,19,"""On seeing you in the shape of a deer, Seetha undoubtedly bids her husband forthwith, and even Lakshmana, saying, 'lay hold of it.'"
Aranya Kanda,36,20,"""Then on the diversion of those two, Rama and Lakshmana, I will comfortably and unimpededly abduct Seetha in that lonely place, as planet Rahu abducts the shine of moon."
Aranya Kanda,36,21,"""Thereafter Rama will be enervated by the abduction of his wife, and then surely and conveniently I wish to retaliate him if he is going to come up against me, for my inner-soul will be firstly gratified with its volition, namely possessing Seetha."" Thus Ravana requested Maareecha."
Aranya Kanda,36,22,"On listening the very word of Rama that honest-souled Maareecha's mouth is completely dried up, and he is fully frightened."
Aranya Kanda,36,23,"Wetting dried up lips with his tongue he has become goggle-eyed almost like an about-to-die animal, and he agonisingly looked up at Ravana with winkless eyes."
Aranya Kanda,36,24,"Maareecha's heart sank with scare as he is aware of Rama's valour when he was in the great forest of Tataka, thus suppliantly making palm-fold he started telling about factuality of Rama to Ravana, which is beneficial both to Ravana and to himself, as well, if only Ravana is heedful of it."
Aranya Kanda,37,1,"On hearing that idea of the chief of demons Ravana in abducting Seetha, Maareecha, a well-informed one and an articulator spoke to the lord of demons in reply."
Aranya Kanda,37,2,"""It will always be easy to get people who talk pleasantly, oh, king, but it is impossible to get them who talk judgementally and give suggestions that may be apparently insipid, but that are recuperative, more so, it is impossible to get listeners of such advises."
Aranya Kanda,37,3,"""Definitely you do not apperceive Rama who is decidedly dynamic and exaltedly adept, for you are impetuous and desultory in dealing with your spies, but that Rama is identical to the thunderous Mahendra and tempestuous Varuna, the Rain-god."
Aranya Kanda,37,4,"""Oh, boy, will there be safety to all demons on earth? Or, that highly enraged Rama will render this world de-demonised!"
Aranya Kanda,37,5,"""Has this Seetha, the daughter of Janaka, taken birth to end your life, or what! And because of this Seetha will there be a great disaster, so to speak!"
Aranya Kanda,37,6,"""Egocentric and rampant, such as you are, on acquiring you as her lord, will the City of Lanka be doomed along with her demons, and you put together, or what!"
Aranya Kanda,37,7,"""Any king of your like who is with a self-will, ill-will, ensorcelled by evil, and malicious in intent, that king alone ruins his own city-state, his own people, even himself, as a matter of actual fact."
Aranya Kanda,37,8,"""Rama the enhancer of his mother Kausalya's happiness is completely forsaken by his father - no, he is not; there is unseemliness in him - no, not in the least; he is out of character - no; he is selfish - no; he is an ignoble Kshatriya - no, not at all; and he is neither a debased one insofar as the merits of righteousness are concerned, nor he is atrocious towards living beings, for he takes delight in the welfare of all beings. [3-37-8, 9]"
Aranya Kanda,37,10,"""On seeing his father who is a proponent of truth, and whom Kaikeyi has outwitted, that virtue-souled Rama neatly decamped from Ayodhya saying that 'I will prove my father to be a real proponent of truth.'"
Aranya Kanda,37,11,"""Discarding the kingdom and even royal-comforts Rama entered Dandaka forest only to fulfil the cherish of Kaikeyi, viz., kingdom for her son Bharata, and even that of Dasharatha, viz., to remain loyal to his promise to Kaikeyi."
Aranya Kanda,37,12,"""Rama is ruthless - no; an unscholarly one - no; unconquered are his senses - no; and oh, boy, it is unapt of you to speak of impalpable and unheard-of topics in this way."
Aranya Kanda,37,13,"""Rama is the embodiment of righteousness, he is an equable person with truthfulness as his valour, and as with Indra to all gods he is the king of entire world."
Aranya Kanda,37,14,"""Rama's proper resplendence is protecting Vaidehi. How then you really wish to forcibly rob her off from Rama, as though wishing to rob the Sun of his resplendence."
Aranya Kanda,37,15,"""Arrows as it jets of fire, bow and sword as it firewood that fire called Rama will be blazing in war, and it will be inapt of you to enter into such an uninfringeable fire, recklessly."
Aranya Kanda,37,15,"""With the bow stretched to his ear becoming a gaping mouth spouting flames, arrows becoming tongues of fire spewed forth from that flaming mouth, he that Rama the reified Terminator will become fierce and insufferable when he wields bow and arrows, and oh, dear boy Ravana, it will be inapt of you to at once draw pretty nigh of such an annihilator of the armies of enemies, on discarding your kingdom, comforts and even the dear life of yours. [3-37-16, 17]"
Aranya Kanda,37,18,"""Which Rama's wife is Janaka's daughter that Rama is indeed with an inestimable resplendence, and it will be incapable of you to steal Seetha while such a Rama's bow safeguards her in the forest, besides the firewall called his resplendence."
Aranya Kanda,37,19,"""That lady Seetha is his wife, dearest than the lives of that lion-chested lion-man Rama, and in truth, she is avowed to follow him alone, in perpetuity."
Aranya Kanda,37,20,"""As the spire of blazing ritual fire cannot be abused, so also, she that curvaceous Maithili, the cherished wife of that dynamic Rama, is an impossibility for any abuse."
Aranya Kanda,37,21,"""Oh, king of demons, What is the result in making such a futile effort? If that Rama glances at you in a given war that alone ends your life."
Aranya Kanda,37,22,"""If you cherish to take pleasure for a long time in your life, in your comforts and also thus in your kingdom, which kingdom is highly impossible to achieve, do not do anything unpleasant to Rama."
Aranya Kanda,37,21,"""Such as you are, you should firstly deliberate with all of your ministers that have a righteous bearing, duly keeping your brother Vibheeshana at the helm of affairs, and then you take a decision on your own considering rights and wrongs of the case, and bearing in mind about your own strengths and weakness, and even on making sure of Raghava's capability in its reality, and then it will be apt of you to take up befitting action that will be conducive to your interests. [3-37-24,25]"
Aranya Kanda,37,25,"""Oh, king of nightwalkers Ravana, I for myself deem that your confrontation with Rama, the prince of Kosala, in a war is improper, and a better, befitting, and a reasonable one is this advise of mine, to which you may listen further."
Aranya Kanda,38,1,"""At one time even I was on the rove around this earth, taking pride in my valour, bearing the strength of a thousand elephants, mountainous in my size and black-cloudlike in my sheen, wearing ear-knobs and a crown made out of refined gold, with a bludgeon as my weapon, and such as I was, I rambled Dandaka forest causing terror to the world, and eating the fleshes of sages."" Thus Maareecha started to narrate his experience with Rama. [3-38-1, 2]"
Aranya Kanda,38,2,"""The virtue-souled great-saint Vishvamitra who was highly scared of me, then on going to Dasharatha in person that great-saint spoke this to that lord of people. [3-38-3b, 4a]"

Aranya Kanda,38,7,"""When the sage Vishvamitra is spoken thus, then he said to the king, 'No other force in the world than Rama can counterbalance that demon. [3-38-8b, 9a]"
Aranya Kanda,38,8,""" 'No doubt, you are a defender of gods in wars, and oh, king, the exploits you have undertaken on behalf of gods are well-known in the triad of worlds. [3-38-9b, 10a]"

[3-38-10b, 11]"
Aranya Kanda,38,12,"""Thus that way on saying he that sage Vishvamitra returned to his own hermitage highly gladdening to take the prince Rama along with him."

Aranya Kanda,38,12,"""At that time, yet unborn are the identities of adulthood like moustache on his face, and that providential one was magnificent in looks with a peacock-blue complexion, wearing a single cloth, locks of hair, and golden locket, and wielding a bow, and he was irradiating the Dandaka forest with a radiating radiance of his own, and then he appeared like the just risen baby-moon. [3-38-14, 15]"
Aranya Kanda,38,16,"""And I who was like a massive black-cloud, wearing golden ear-knobs, already a forceful one further reinforced with the boon of Brahma, I pridefully entered into the interior of Vishwamitra's hermitage."
Aranya Kanda,38,17,"""Rama quickly noticed me on my very entry with an uplifted weapon, and on seeing me he unexcitedly strung bowstring to his bow."
Aranya Kanda,38,18,"""Unmindfully trivialising him as, 'this Raghava is just a boy,' I made haste and ran towards that Fire-altar of Vishvamitra."
Aranya Kanda,38,19,"""He then released an acute arrow that eliminates the enemy, and hit by it I am plunged into the ocean which was a hundred yojana-s off."
Aranya Kanda,38,20,"""That Rama did not wish to kill me then, and I am thus saved by that valiant one, oh, dear boy Ravana, but the thrust of Rama's arrow bewildered my animation and I was on my last legs."
Aranya Kanda,38,21,"""That way I who had been flung into the abyssal water of the ocean by him gained consciousness after a long time and proceeded towards the city of Lanka."
Aranya Kanda,38,22,"""At that time, that one with elementary knowledge in the use of weaponry, but who can undertake deeds in an effortless manner, such a boy, such a Rama spared me, albeit killing them that were my helpmates in that escapade."
Aranya Kanda,38,23,"""Thereby, if you wish to make for any confrontation with Rama, despite of my proscribing you, you will ruin yourself on getting a disastrous calamity."
Aranya Kanda,38,24,"""The demons are methodical in sporting and flirting, thus by their own conduct they are also socialising and frolicking, and to them you derive distress and disaster."
Aranya Kanda,38,25,"""Dense with skyscrapers and palaces, and decorated with many a gemstone is that city Lanka, but you will see it completely shattered down, for the sake of that Maithili."
Aranya Kanda,38,26,"""Even if with uncommitted sins, the sinless will get ruined owing to their interdependence with other sinners, like the fish in a lake with snakes."
Aranya Kanda,38,27,"""Bedaubed with divine sandal-paste, beautified with divine ornaments are the limbs of the demons now, perchance you will be seeing them trampled out on ground for the blunder of yours."

Aranya Kanda,38,29,"""Without a doubt you will be seeing Lanka encircled with an enmesh of arrows, enfolded in the tongues of torches, while her buildings are utterly gutting down."
Aranya Kanda,38,30,"""Oh, king, there is no other sin that is outrageous and gravest than the dalliance with another's wife and, besides, you already have a thousand wives, isn't so!"
Aranya Kanda,38,31,"""Abide by your own wife and be delighted with her, oh, demon, safeguard your own ethnos, thus safeguard dignity, affluence, and kingdom of demons, thereby safeguard even your own dear life."

Thus, Maareecha spoke to Ravana."
Aranya Kanda,39,1,"""Thus I was somehow released by him in a confrontation then in his teens. Now you may also listen to what has happened later in his adulthood."" Thus Maareecha continued his advise to Ravana."
Aranya Kanda,39,2,"""Though Rama hit me previously in such a way, I unabashedly entered Dandaka forest together with two more demons who were in the guise of animals."
Aranya Kanda,39,3,"""On becoming a gigantic carnivorous animal with a torching tongue, incisive teeth and excruciating horns, and with an extraordinary energy, I was on the rove in Dandaka forest while getting at Rama."

Aranya Kanda,39,8,"""I was in the shape of an animal with incisive horns. Such as I was I recollected my earlier grudge against that great mighty Rama who takes delight in the welfare of all being, who by then was santlike on a regulated diet and abiding in the forest, whereby I presumed him to be mere hermit. In that way, I was very extremely infuriated to recollect his earlier assault on me, and I indiscriminately dashed towards him, only to kill him, completely disregarding his other faculties.

Aranya Kanda,39,13,"""As I have earlier seen the fear caused by his arrow I am in the know of Rama's valour, hence I retreated from there trickily and gingerly, but the other two demons were killed."
Aranya Kanda,39,14,"""When I was somehow exempted by the arrow of Rama I regained lifespan, and when that arrow made me to renounce everything like a monk and fled me to this place, the other side of ocean to where you came by your aircraft, here I am living here in a yogic way, self-collectedly like an ascetic."

Aranya Kanda,40,21,"""On hearing that, and further hastened by Seetha, even Soumitri apprehensively follows the path of Rama in all his fondness for Rama."
Aranya Kanda,40,22,"""When Rama is diverted from hermitage, Lakshmana as well, I will carry off Vaidehi effortlessly like the Thousand-eyed Indra who once carried off Sachi Devi."
Aranya Kanda,40,23,"""Oh, demon, on carrying out this stint in this manner you may go as you like, and to you oh, Maareecha with solemn vows, I will grant half of my kingdom."
Aranya Kanda,40,24,"""Hence, oh, gentle one, get going on a trouble-free path for the easy achievement of the task, and I for myself will follow you to Dandaka forest along with the chariot."
Aranya Kanda,40,25,"""My goal will be achieved just by misleading Raghava, and by gaining Seetha without a conflict, then I will proceed to Lanka along with you."
Aranya Kanda,40,26,"""If you are not going to do so, oh, Maareecha, for sure I will kill you now itself. I will get my work done through you even under duress, and indeed, any subject setting against his king will never succeed safely."
Aranya Kanda,40,27,"""Your life may be indefinite on reaching Rama, but your death is surely definite now as you are conflicting with me. Hence, keeping all this in view you come to a conclusion that would be conducive to your interests, and whatever desirable to you let it be done in that way. "" Thus Ravana spoke to Maareecha."
Aranya Kanda,41,1,"When Ravana perversely ordered that way in all his kingliness, Maareecha spoke these words caustically and frankly to that king of demons."
Aranya Kanda,41,2,"""Oh, night-walker, by which evildoer this thought, which is self-ruinous to you, along with your progeny, kingdom and ministers put together, is taught to you?"
Aranya Kanda,41,3,"""Who is that reprobate unhappy with such a happy one like you, and oh, king, by whom this door of demise is ingeniously shown to you?"
Aranya Kanda,41,4,"""It is very clear, oh, night-walker, that your rivals with skimpy might are aspiring that you should be completely ruined coming into conflict with more mighty Rama."
Aranya Kanda,41,5,"""He who wishes you to get ruined by your undertaking a self-made destruction is a scoundrel with a pernicious intent, as such, by whom you are counselled to do this?"
Aranya Kanda,41,6,"""Your ministers are not curbing you anywise when you scramble on a high road to self-ruination, hence they are indeed to be sentenced to death, but they are not being executed for their dereliction."
Aranya Kanda,41,7,"""Veracious ministers have to restrain a self-willed king when he relies on a wrong-route, isn't it. But you are unrestrained by your ministers though you are self-willed and though you are taking a wrong-route."
Aranya Kanda,41,8,"""Oh, best conqueror Ravana, probity, prosperity and pleasures, and even the popularity of the ministers, oh, night-walker, are achieved at the beneficence of their master."
Aranya Kanda,41,9,"""Contrariwise, oh, Ravana, all that beneficence of the king to ministers becomes futile when the king behaves perversely, and even the others, namely the subjects of kingdom, will derive distress by the negative virtue of their master."
Aranya Kanda,41,10,"""The king alone is the root cause for probity and prosperity, isn't it. Therefore, oh, best prosperous one, in all situations the kings are to be safeguarded from the ill effects of influences."
Aranya Kanda,41,11,"""It is impossible to govern kingdom, oh, demon, the night-walker, for a king with acridity, with hostility, or with immorality."
Aranya Kanda,41,12,"""The ministers with drastic notions will indeed fall apart together with their king, like a chariot that gets ramshackled together with it charioteer on a rough road, though it is hieing with galloping horses but badly controlled by that slothful charioteer."
Aranya Kanda,41,13,"""In the world many saintly beings that are high-minded and pursuers of ethicality are completely ruined together with their kinsmen owing to the misdeeds of others."
Aranya Kanda,41,14,"""Oh, Ravana, the subjects do not flourish while a lord with contrariety and coerciveness safeguards them, just like goats guarded by a fox."
Aranya Kanda,41,15,"""All those demons will definitely ruin, oh, Ravana, to whom you are the acrimonious and malicious king with unconquered senses, though you have conquered the heaven."
Aranya Kanda,41,16,"""What is the use of laming for myself as I foregathered this ghastly situation as in crow-palm-tree syndrome, but in this issue you alone are regrettable, for you are gong to completely ruin along with your military."
Aranya Kanda,41,17,"""That Rama will soon kill you after killing me, and I will be dying at the hand of my enemy rather than at the hand of my own clansman like you, whereby the purpose of my life will be brought to an end."
Aranya Kanda,41,18,"""Know that I am killed just when Rama notices me, and know that you are also killed along with your kinsmen just when you steal Seetha."
Aranya Kanda,41,19,"""If you are going to bring Seetha from their hermitage on going there with me, then you will not be there, I will not be there, Lanka will not be there, the demons will not be there."
Aranya Kanda,41,20,"""As a desirer of your welfare I am dissuading you, oh, night-walker, but you may feel that this word of mine is unpleasant to you. People on diminishing lifetime will be similar to corpses and a corpse cannot take in the expedient spoken by considerate confidants, isn't so."
Aranya Kanda,42,1,"Maareecha though curtly said in that way, then afraid of the king of night-walkers he became self-pitying, and said to Ravana, 'let us go.'"
Aranya Kanda,42,2,"""If he who wields a bow, arrows and a sword, and who brandishes a weapon to only kill me happens to see me again, deem my life is verily lost, without his shooting any arrow."
Aranya Kanda,42,3,"""None can really make so bold at Rama to reappear with life, isn't it. What is appearing before you is the reflected image of mine, as I am already slain by the wand of Yama, the Terminator, the moment I conceded to your demand."
Aranya Kanda,42,4,"""When you are spiteful, oh, boy, indeed what can I possibly do otherwise, oh, night-walker, thither I go, may good betide you."" So said Maareecha to Ravana."
Aranya Kanda,42,5,By that word of Maareecha demon Ravana is very much gladdened and he spoke this sentence tightly hugging him.
Aranya Kanda,42,6,"""This word of yours shows your obduracy for you are abiding under the control of my dictate, and though you were a different night-walker earlier, henceforth you are really the good old Maareecha."
Aranya Kanda,42,7,"""Then you promptly emplane this sky-flying chariot which is yoked with ghost-faced mules and adorned with gems along with me."
Aranya Kanda,42,8,"""On deluding Vaidehi it is apt of you to go as you please, and I will bring that Seetha of Mithila, however defiant it might be."" Thus Ravana said to Maareecha."
Aranya Kanda,42,9,"Tataka's son Maareecha said ""All right"" to Ravana, and then both Ravana and Maareecha mounted the chariot as they would emplane an aircraft and swiftly journeyed from the surroundings of Maareecha's hermitage. [3-42-9, 10a]"
Aranya Kanda,42,10,"While looking at the seaports and forests, also at all the mountains and rivers, even at the cities and provinces en route they proceeded. [3-42-10b, 11a]"
Aranya Kanda,42,11,"On reaching Dandaka forest along with Maareecha the king of demons Ravana has then seen the hermitage of Raghava. [3-42-11b, 12a]"
Aranya Kanda,42,12,"Alighting the chariot that is decorated with golden ornaments Ravana then spoke this sentence to Maareecha taking his hand into his. [3-42-12b, 13a]"
Aranya Kanda,42,13,"""This one which we are seeing and which is surrounded with banana plants is the threshold of Rama's hermitage, and -`----oh, friend, the purpose for which we came here let it be effectuated promptly."" Thus Ravana hastened Maareecha. [3-42-13b, 14a]"
Aranya Kanda,42,14,"""And on hearing Ravana's words demon Maareecha then became a deer and indeed ambled freely in the frontage of Rama's hermitage. [3-42-14b, 15a]"
Aranya Kanda,42,15,"Adopting the form of a gorgeous deer which is superbly amazing just by its appearance, whose tips of antlers are in the hue of best sapphires, and whose face is whitish at some places and not so whitish at other in its look, he became a Golden Deer and moved thereabout. [3-42-15b, 16a]"
Aranya Kanda,42,16,"One of its cheeks in the shade of a reddish-lotus while the other in the hue of a bluish-lotus, one of its ears is in the hue of bloomed blue-lotus while the other is in the shade of a sapphire, while the shine of its stomach is like that of a best blue-diamond, Indra-niila-maNi, and with a little upraised neck that deer has moved about there. [3-42-16b, 17a]"
Aranya Kanda,42,17,"One flank is shining whitish like Madhuka flowers and the other is similar to the roseate fibrils of lotuses, while its hooves are similar to the gemstone lapis, calves thin, and thus with very well cohered limbs that deer moved about there. [3-42-17b, 18a]"
Aranya Kanda,42,18,"With an upraised tail that shone forth in a tinge equal to the weapon of Indra, namely Rainbow, and with a complexion that is lustrous and dappled with many diverse gemlike dapples, that deer moved thereabout with a heart-stealing aura. [3-42-18b, 19a]"
Aranya Kanda,42,19,"Thus that demon Maareecha emerged like a highly splendorous and fascinating deer in a wink highly irradiating those woodlands, and the threshold of Rama's hermitage in particular. [3-42-19b, 20a]"
Aranya Kanda,42,20,"Adopting such an exquisite and heart-stealing form which is amazingly dappled with the colours of diverse ores, that demon ambled all over there freely with the bearing of a real deer in order that Vaidehi might be deluded, and he moved forward onto the pastures. [3-42-2b, 21]"
Aranya Kanda,42,22,And with hundreds of silvery stipples of body he became an astonishing deer with pleasant looks and indeed moved chewing new grass-blades of trees.
Aranya Kanda,42,23,"That Golden Deer has gone into the boscages of banana plants, and moved here and there around Karnikara trees, and then resorted to a place which is within the eyeshot of Seetha."
Aranya Kanda,42,24,"With an odd lotus like hind-side that astounding deer is verily scintillating, and it milled around the surroundings in the threshold of Rama's hermitage according to its own delight."
Aranya Kanda,42,25,"That excellent deer beats a retreat and again returns, and meanders thus time and again, and turns its tail for sometime only to return once again very playfully."
Aranya Kanda,42,26,"Again gambolling everywhere it sits somewhere on the ground, then, on coming to the threshold of hermitage it goes towards herds of deer."
Aranya Kanda,42,26,"That demon who has gone into the deer-hood has gone after some herd of deer. But he returned again though that herd followed him wanting to fraternise, in order that he shall remain perceptible to Seetha, and he whirligiged in amusing circles while leaping and bounding to and from that herd of deer. [3-42-27, 28a]"
Aranya Kanda,42,27,"All the other animals moving in that forest on seeing this demon-deer with their necks up have come close to it, and on smelling it well they are running away to all the ten directions noticing it as a demon turned into a deer. [3-42-28b, 29a]"
Aranya Kanda,42,28,"Even that demon in the deer's semblance Maareecha, though indulged in killing those forest animals, and though the other animals are touching him, he is not killing and eating them indulgently, only for the reason of camouflaging his present nature of demon-hood. [3-42-29b, 30a]"
Aranya Kanda,42,29,"What is more, Vaidehi with her felicitous eyes came towards trees yearning for plucking the flowers in the same instant. [3-42-30b, 31a]"
Aranya Kanda,42,30,"And she with her inebriating glances and delightful visage moved there about while plucking flowers of Karnikaara, Ashoka, and of Mango trees. [3-42-31b, 32a]"
Aranya Kanda,42,31,"That select lady who is unmeet for forest life beheld that deer which is completely gemlike and whose limbs are surprising as though studded with pearls and gems. [3-42-32b, 33a]"
Aranya Kanda,42,32,"And she that Seetha goggled the Golden Deer with a wide-eyed astonishment, which deer has pretty lips and teeth, hair resembling silver and copper ores, and she indeed gazed at it with an affinity for wildlife. [3-42-33b, 34a]"
Aranya Kanda,42,33,"On seeing Rama's wife Seetha that highly phantasmal deer too then moved there about as though to scintillate that woodland. [3-42-34b, 35a]"
Aranya Kanda,42,34,"To see such a deer which is hitherto unseen, and which is as though studded with numerous gems, the daughter of Janaka, Seetha, went in to an intense wonderment. [3-42-35b, c]"
Aranya Kanda,43,1,"That slender-waisted Seetha whose limbs are flawless, whose complexion is like purified gold, and who is presently culling flowers is highly gladdened to observe the Golden Deer that is brightened in one flank with the colour of gold and the other is silvery, and she shouted for attention of her husband, and even that of Lakshmana who is presently weaponed. [3-43-1, 2]"
Aranya Kanda,43,3,"""Oh, noble prince, come here,"" thus she called her husband and peered at the deer, and again she called, ""really come with your younger brother quickly,"" and again gazed at the deer, and thus she oftentimes called and oftentimes saw the deer fondly."
Aranya Kanda,43,4,Those manly lions Rama and Lakshmana thus bidden by Vaidehi came there exploring that place and then they saw that Golden Deer.
Aranya Kanda,43,5,"But Lakshmana became incredulous on seeing it and said to Rama, ""I believe this deer to be that Maareecha, the demon."""
Aranya Kanda,43,6,"""Oh, Rama, when kings engaged in hunting games were delightedly moving in the forest, this Maareecha killed many of them resorting to many disguises, for he is a guise-changer by his wish."
Aranya Kanda,43,7,"""Maareecha is an expert in many wiles and he has now assumed the form of this Golden-Deer, oh, manly lion, which is not more than the scintillating city of Gandharva-s, a city of wiles, which any trickster can create to make-believe."
Aranya Kanda,43,8,"""Oh, Raghava, this kind of amazing animal with gemlike dapples is nonexistent in the world, isn't it. Hence, oh, lord of the world, this is truly a phantasm. No doubt about it."" So said Lakshmana to Rama."
Aranya Kanda,43,9,"While Lakshmana of Kakutstha-s is speaking thus, she who is self-satisfied as her heart is conjured by the cozenage, such a Seetha of a toothy smile deterred him and spoke."
Aranya Kanda,43,10,"""Oh, nobleman's son, that delightful deer is stealing my heart, oh, dextrous one, bring it round, it will be our plaything."
Aranya Kanda,43,11,"""Here in the threshold of our hermitage many animals with adorable manifestation are moving about in flocks and herds, say Caamara deer, like that Srimara deer."
Aranya Kanda,43,12,"""Also the animals that are excellent in their form, say monkeys, are moving here. Likewise herds of Kinnara deer, spotted-deer, and even bears of great-might are freely moving here."
Aranya Kanda,43,13,"""As to how this extraordinary deer is appearing, oh, king, by way of its brilliance, tameness, or by the lustre of its skin, I have not so far seen any coequal to this."
Aranya Kanda,43,14,"""Diversely coloured, amazingly limbed, and spotted with gemlike dapples it is shining forth like a deer that is completely gemmy, and while nonchalantly moving before me it is enlivening the forest like the moon."
Aranya Kanda,43,15,"""Ah, what a form, ah, what a brilliance, what a beautiful bleat! This amazingly limbed deer is wonderful, and this is stealing my heart, as it were."
Aranya Kanda,43,16,"""It will be surprising if this deer draws into your capture alive and well, as it creates astonishment to one and all."
Aranya Kanda,43,17,"""When we return to kingdom on completing our dwelling in forest this deer becomes a masterpiece in palace-chambers for us."
Aranya Kanda,43,18,"""Oh, lord, the form of this deer creates an excellent jubilation to Bharata, to you the son of the nobleman, to my mothers-in-law, and also to me in palace-chambers."
Aranya Kanda,43,19,"""Else if that best deer does not come into you capture while alive, oh tigerly-man, at the least its gorgeous deerskin will be remnant of it."
Aranya Kanda,43,20,"""I wish to sit along with you on its golden deerskin, overlaying it on a seat of tender darbha grass-blades, in case the deer is felled."
Aranya Kanda,43,21,"""Tradition says that this sort of unruly self-seeking is unbefitting to women, yet that deer's beautiful body is inducing curiosity in me."" Seetha said so to Rama and remained waiting for his reply."
Aranya Kanda,43,21,"As for that deer's horns they vie with excellent sapphires, its golden coat with the glitter of tender sun, and its ambience with silver spots on coat with a milk way containing twinkling stars, and by that reason even Raghava's heart is awestruck when he saw it. [3-43-22, 23a]"
Aranya Kanda,43,22,"In this way, hearing the words of Seetha and observing that wondrous deer Raghava is also amused by its form, and even motivated by Seetha in fetching it, he delightedly spoke this word to his brother Lakshmana. [3-43-23b, 24]"
Aranya Kanda,43,23,"""Lakshmana, behold this enthusiastic delight of Vaidehi. Oh, Soumitri, presently no other deer indeed with such an excellent form exists in this forest. Or else, does it exist in Nandana Gardens of Indra - no, it cannot be there; in the adjoins of Caitraratha Gardens of Kubera - no, it will not be there, then how can there be some deer on earth which is similar to this! [3-43-25, 26]"
Aranya Kanda,43,27,"""Amazing are its hairlines with hair upturned at some places and down-turned at other, and the golden spots embedded on the coat of the deer are glittery."
Aranya Kanda,43,28,"""See at its tongue that is exserting from its mouth while it is yawning, which is similar to the flaring tongue of fire and to the lightning from a cloud."
Aranya Kanda,43,29,"""Its face is like a mug made up of sapphires, its paunch is pearly and conchoidal, and whose heart is it that will not lured for this deer with an inexplicable beauty."
Aranya Kanda,43,30,"""On seeing at this astounding look of the deer which is golden in glitter and bejewelled numerously as it were, whose heart is it that will not be transported into astonishment."
Aranya Kanda,43,31,"""Kings pursuing games of hunting in great forests, oh, Lakshmana, will be felling deer either for the sake of flesh, or just for the purpose of sporting archery."
Aranya Kanda,43,32,"""And exerting themselves in great forests they by far amass forest produce, ores, jewels, gemstones and the gravel of gold."
Aranya Kanda,43,33,"""Everything of that wealth from forest produce will be filling the treasuries of kings, like the speculated objects filling the entire treasury of Shukra just by his thinking of them in his mind."
Aranya Kanda,43,34,"""The financial experts and the other financially well-off people say that with which aspirational activity an aspirant unhesitatingly scurries and achieves it, that achieved target alone is lauded to be worthwhile, or, as real wealth."
Aranya Kanda,43,35,"""This comely Vaidehi will be sitting on that invaluable golden skin of that gem of a deer along with me."
Aranya Kanda,43,36,"""I think the skin of Kadali deer, or of Priyaki deer, or of Praveni deer, or as a matter of fact the skins of best breed of deer or sheep will not be match to the deerskin of this deer, insofar as the soft-touch is concerned."
Aranya Kanda,43,37,"""Only two divine deer are there, this magnificent deer on earth, and the other that moves in skies remaining in stellar region."
Aranya Kanda,43,38,"""You are telling me that 'this is the wizardry of the demon.' Even then, Lakshmana, if this results in that way as a demon's wizardry, my duty also results in the elimination of that deer."
Aranya Kanda,43,39,"""If this deer is Maareecha, this heinous and vicious-souled demon has indeed tortured many eminent sages earlier when was on the prowl in the forests, thus he is eliminable."
Aranya Kanda,43,40,"""He rebelliously killed many kings who are excellent archers while they were in hunting games, at least for that reason this bestial monster is eradicable."
Aranya Kanda,43,41,"""Demon Vaataapi who held ascetics in contempt was here earlier, and staying in the stomachs of Brahmans he used to come out by ripping their stomachs open and thus he was killing Brahmans, like a mare-calf killing its own mother at its time of birth by ripping the womb of its own mother."
Aranya Kanda,43,42,"""On one occasion after some time, that Vaataapi avariciously obtained that great-saint and the one who is endowed with effulgent, namely Agastya, as an eatable, but actually that demon has became an eatable to the sage."
Aranya Kanda,43,43,"""On observing the demon Vaataapi who is trying to assume his original form of demon in order to come out of his stomach, that godly saint Agastya spoke this to Vaataapi with a scornful smile."
Aranya Kanda,43,44,""" 'Oh, Vaataapi, you have irreverently eradicated the best Brahmans in this world owing to your might, therefore I have assimilated you.' So said sage Agastya to Vaataapi."
Aranya Kanda,43,42,"""Lakshmana, such a demon who is like Vaataapi will not be there any more. He who disregards someone of my kind, who always abides in righteousness and who is self-controlled, such a demon will be eliminated as sage Agastya has eliminated demon Vaataapi, if that demon happens to get at me. [3-43-45, 46a]"
Aranya Kanda,43,43,"""Oh, Lakshmana, the descendent of Raghu, you stay here in all preparedness and guard Maithili steadfastly, whatever enterprise of ours is there that is founded in her. [3-43-46b, 47a]"
Aranya Kanda,43,44,"""I wish to catch this deer, Soumitri, if not I will kill it, and I will be going forthwith to fetch the deer. [3-43-47b, 48a]"
Aranya Kanda,43,48,"""Lakshmana, see how Vaidehi's percept is overtaken by deerskin. Indeed by the strangeness of its skin that deer must be a mysterious being, hence, it will not survive now."
Aranya Kanda,43,46,"""Oh, Lakshmana, apply yourself vigilantly while staying in hermitage along with Seetha. So soon as I go I will be felling that spotted deer with one arrow and returning quickly. [3-43-49b, 50]"
Aranya Kanda,43,51,"""Oh, Lakshmana, you be here taking care of Maithili along with the forthright, formidable and fatherly bird Jatayu, and be watchful and suspicious from everywhere and every split-second."" Thus Rama spoke to Lakshmana and started to go after the deer"
Aranya Kanda,44,1,"Rama, the great-resplendent scion of Raghu, on instructing his brother Lakshmana in that way securely fastened his sword with golden handle to his waist."
Aranya Kanda,44,2,"Rama whose valour is escalating then took his own insignia, the three-way arched bow called kodanDa, and fastened two quivers and proceeded."
Aranya Kanda,44,3,"On peering at the peerless one among kings, namely Rama, who is indeed coming down on him, that Golden Deer disappeared as if with fear and even to beguile him, and again it came into clear visibility. And Rama speedily spurted to that place from where the Golden Deer has firstly disappeared with securely grit sword and firmly handled bow."
Aranya Kanda,44,4,"Rama the wielder of bow kept on beholding that Golden Deer which is observing him over and over and running away into deep of the forest. In the next moment he has seen it right in front of him as though effulgent with its marvellous form. At times he has seen it running away as though to circumvent the fall of arrow, and at times stopping only to tantalise him. Sometimes it appeared to be springing as though to skies in very highly perplexity of wariness. It is disappearing somewhere in the thickets of forest, and it is putting in an appearance elsewhere in those thickets, like the autumnal orb of the moon under the fly front of splintered clouds. [3-44-4b, 5, 6, 7a]"
Aranya Kanda,44,5,"In a wink Rama could proximately see that Maareecha who transformed himself into the Golden Deer, and again in a flash he appeared distantly. Thus that deer/demon has drawn off Raghava very far from his hermitage in this hide and seek game. [3-44-7b, 8]"
Aranya Kanda,44,9,"Rama of Kakutstha is incensed as its form is spellbinding but its capture slippery, and then verily tired as he is he stayed on a pasture taking shelter of a tree shade."
Aranya Kanda,44,10,"Nightwalker Maareecha has further maddened Rama in the guise of Golden Deer by reappearing in his close-by, surrounded with other animals of the forest."
Aranya Kanda,44,11,"Again on seeing Rama who is stalking his catch that deer ran towards him as though to impress with its guilelessness, and just at that moment it vanished again as if with extreme fear."
Aranya Kanda,44,12,"Then that deer has again emerged out of the thick of trees, and on spotting it the great-resplendent Rama has firmed up his decision to fell it."
Aranya Kanda,44,10,"At that instant Raghava became highly infuriated and unholstered a holocaustic, enemy-subjugating arrow that is similar to the flare of the sun, tautening it on his very sturdy bow that forceful Rama forcefully outstretched the bowstring with arrow targeting the Golden Deer alone, and released that fierily blazing arrow-missile which is carefully created by Brahma and which is hissing like a snake. [3-44-13, 14, 15a]"
Aranya Kanda,44,11,"On very profoundly impaling the body of deer's form that superb arrow which is similar to a thunderbolt has severed the heart of Maareecha in the core of deer's body. [3-44-15b, 16a]"
Aranya Kanda,44,12,"Then Maareecha is highly frenzied as his lifespan is minimised, blared a blaring shriek, vaulted up to a height of palm-tree, and fell down onto the ground. [3-44-16b, 17a]"
Aranya Kanda,44,13,"Maareecha on his part abandoned the body of Golden Deer when he is dying. But remembering the words of Ravana that demon gave a thought, 'how best will Seetha hasten Lakshmana to this place, and how best Ravana can abduct Seetha in a place void of people.' [3-44-17b, 18]"
Aranya Kanda,44,19,"Perceptive of the time that chanced bearing his death, and wishful of the death of Ravana too, then made a voice that is a soundalike to Raghava's voice and yelled 'ha, Seetha...' also thus 'ha Lakshmana...'"
Aranya Kanda,44,15,"When Rama's incomparable arrow has indeed shattered his crucial organ, namely the heart, in a downright manner, then Maareecha assumed a very massive physique of a demon, abandoning the form of Golden Deer. [3-44-20, 21a]"
Aranya Kanda,44,16,"On seeing that demon with a fiendish look, who has fallen to earth with limbs steeped in blood, and who is weltering on the surface of earth, Rama emotionally took flight to Seetha reminiscing Lakshmana's words. [3-44-21b, 22]"
Aranya Kanda,44,23,"""This is the trickery of Maareecha which Lakshmana vouchsafed earlier, that has indeed happened in that way alone, and the one whom I have killed now is none other than Maareecha."
Aranya Kanda,44,24,"""This demon died while crying out with a blatant voice 'ha, Seetha... ha, Lakshmana...' And on hearing this how Seetha will be? And what will be the plight of dextrous Lakshmana?"" Thus on thinking over them that righteous-souled Rama remained in a hair-raising predicament."
Aranya Kanda,44,26,"On killing that demon in the form of Golden Deer, and also on hearing his yelling, Rama is ensorcelled with a frantic fear caused by his own gloom."
Aranya Kanda,44,27,"Raghava then on killing another spotted deer and on taking its flesh, he hurried himself towards Janasthaana."
Aranya Kanda,45,1,"This is a much debated chapter in Ramayana because human complexities are involved in its narration. The sublimity of Seetha's characterisation is disputed by her speeches in here. The question is whether Seetha becomes an ideal woman in view of her tongue-lashing, or not. This is as good as asking the nature as to 'why it thunders before a storm, scaring children, birds and calves... cannot it just shower some rains and go...' If anything is not done in accordance with her wish and whim, or which goes against her peculiar way of thinking, it is usual for a shrewd woman to tongue-lash. Here, Seetha is called a woman who is bhartR^i prema antha - bhartR^i kShema arthi 'blinded by the devotement to her husband...' 'a desirer of her husband's welfare...' even at her own risk."
Aranya Kanda,45,2,"This Ramayana is not the story of Rama. It is raama ayana and becomes raamaayaNa when compounded. Again raama is not the epical hero Rama alone. Seetha is also raamaa as said by Sumantra in Ayodhya, Ch. 60, 10th verse:"
Aranya Kanda,45,3,"Thus this epic is called raamaa raamayoH ayanam raamaayaNam 'the peregrination of Seetha and Rama...' where the first word raamaa with elongated end syllable belongs to Seetha and the second raama with shortened end syllable belongs to Rama, and thus this is the peregrination of both Raamaa and Raama. If the course of the legend has to move forward, the characters have to move, and if they were to move, some situations should become turning points, and this is one such situation occasioned through the shrewdness of Seetha. In a legendary perspective, if evil is to be eliminated, good has to peregrinate troublesomely, and that troublesome peregrination of Seetha, as well as that of Rama, is triggered off at this situation, again due to the shrewdness of Seetha. Thus, there is no oddity in the shrewd talk of Seetha. Some more discussion is incorporated in the endnote."
Aranya Kanda,45,1,"On identifying the grievous voice that is identifiable with her husband's voice, Seetha spoke to Lakshmana, ""you go at once, and check up on Raghava.'"
Aranya Kanda,45,5,"""I have heard the loud yelling voice of highly fretful Rama whereby my heart, or my very entity, is not abiding in its place, and it will be apt of you to protect such a brother of yours who is screaming in the forest. [3-45-2, 3a]"
Aranya Kanda,45,6,"""He might have come under the subjugation of demons as with a bull coming under the seize of lions, hence, you hurry up so as to near such a brother of yours who is seeking protection."" So said Seetha toi Lakshmana. [3-45-3b, 4a]"
Aranya Kanda,45,7,"Although she spoke a lot to him in this way, Lakshmana on his part has not moved out remembering his brother's order to stay guard to Seetha, and hence that Janaki, the daughter of Janaka, who is already agitated for Rama further spoke to him in the paradox of his not going out of hermitage. [3-45-4b, 5a]"
Aranya Kanda,45,8,"""You are like a foe of your brother in friend's mien, Soumitri, as you are not making a move towards a brother even if he is in an emergency. [3-45-5b, 6a]"
Aranya Kanda,45,9,"""Because of me you wish Rama to be completely destroyed, and only because of your cupidity for me you are not following up on Raghava. It is definite. [3-45-6b, 7a]"
Aranya Kanda,45,10,""" 'Raghava in direst strait' is the most liked thing to you, thus I deem, as you have no heart for that brother, and as you complacently stay behind even when that great-resplendent Rama is unseen. [3-45-7b, 8a]"
Aranya Kanda,45,11,"""After which helmsman you have come here that Rama is undergoing an uncertainty of life-and-death, as such I indeed wonder what business you have here now in staying with me at this hermitage?"" Seetha spoke so to Lakshmana. [3-45-8, 9a]"
Aranya Kanda,45,12,"Lakshmana spoke to Seetha, the princess from Videha kingdom, who is talking deluged under tears and anguish in that way, as she is fretful like a she-deer. [3-45-9a, 10b]"
Aranya Kanda,45,13,"""Oh, Vaidehi, your husband is an impossible one for vincibility by serpents, asura-s, gandharva-s, gods, fiends, demons, no doubt about it."
Aranya Kanda,45,14,"""Oh, auspicious one, unmarked is some combatant who can counterattack Rama from among gods, humans, gandharva-s, birds, ogres, kinnaraa-s, beasts, or oh, lady, even from horrendous demons, as Rama vies with Indra in any given war. [3-45-11b, 12, 13a]"
Aranya Kanda,45,15,"""It is inapt of you to talk that way as Rama is inextirpable in a given war, and as for me, I do not venture to abandon you in this forest in the absence of Raghava. [3-45-13b, 14a]"
Aranya Kanda,45,16,"""Let the most forceful Crowns with all their military forces, or, all of the gods together with their heads, why they, let all the three worlds put together come mutinously, whether jointly or severally, Rama's prowess is irrestrainable. [3-45, 14b, 15a]"
Aranya Kanda,45,17,"""Hence, let your heart be diverted and anxiety divested, as your husband will be returning soon on killing that extraordinary deer. [3-45-15b, 16a]"
Aranya Kanda,45,18,"""Evidently it is not the voice of Rama, nor that of any other god, but someone mimicked that voice for chicanery, and that must be the illusory voice of that demon Maareecha, similar in effect to the magical city of gandharva-s usually created by magicians in general. [3-45-15b, 16]"
Aranya Kanda,45,19,"""And you are an entrustment, oh, best lady Vaidehi, as the great-souled Rama has entrusted you in my security, as such I do not dare to leave you off now. [3-45-17, 18a]"
Aranya Kanda,45,20,"""Oh, gracious lady, we have become the adversaries of these night-walkers insofar as the elimination of Khara and others, and concerning the eradication of Janasthaana. [3-45-18b, 19a]"
Aranya Kanda,45,21,"""The demons are the swaggerers in violence in great forests and they will be employing various voices. Therefore Vaidehi, just do not bother about it."" Thus Lakshmana advised Seetha. [3-45-18b, 19, 20a]"
Aranya Kanda,45,22,"As for Seetha, she became furious on hearing Lakshmana's words of advice, and while her eyes are becoming bloodshot she spoke these rude sentences to that veracious Lakshmana. [3-45-20b, 21a]"
Aranya Kanda,45,23,"""You are a debased one devoid of mercy, thus a dreadful one, and a degrader of your dynasty, and I deem that you derive pleasure from fatal hardship to Rama. [3-45-21b, 22a]"
Aranya Kanda,45,24,"""You are haranguing all these sermons only on noticing hardship to Rama. It is unsurprising that the pitiless ones and rivals of your kind, who always behave in a cloak-and dagger way, will tend to commit deadly sins, Lakshmana, and it is not uncommon. [3-45-22b, 23]"
Aranya Kanda,45,24,"""You are verily maleficent for you have singly and covertly followed Rama, who started to forests all alone, or instigated by Bharata, only because of me."
Aranya Kanda,45,26,"""Whether this is an intrigue of yours or that of Bharata it is unachievable, Saumitri. How can I long for another commoner when I have put my faith only in the lotus-blue-complexioned and lotus-bright-eyed husband of mine, Rama? [3-45-25, 26a]"
Aranya Kanda,45,27,"""If that comes to that, I will just discard my life in your presence, Soumitri do not mistake it. I do not eke out an existence on this earth even for a moment without Rama."" Thus Seetha threatened Lakshmana. [3-45-26b, 27a]"
Aranya Kanda,45,28,"When that self-mortified Lakshmana is addressed in this way with hair-raising and acerbic words by Seetha, he spoke to her suppliantly adjoining his palm-fold. [3-45-27b, 28a]"
Aranya Kanda,45,29,"""I do not venture to reply you Maithili, as you are like a deity to me. Women using words that are in a class by themselves is not at all surprising. This sort of bringing stilted words into play is the nature of women and it is obvious in the world. [3-45-28b, 29]"
Aranya Kanda,45,30,"""Women by their nature are unbound by the etiquette of decency, whimsical, cantankerous and they tend to become the artificers of vicissitudes, and oh, Vaidehi, the daughter of Janaka, indeed unbearable are this kind of words that are much the same as burnt iron arrows thrust in between my two ears. [3-45-30, 31a]"
Aranya Kanda,45,31,"""Let all of the forest-itinerants indeed listen as to how you are addressing me with bitter words, though I am reasoning with you conscientiously, and let them become my corroborators for the sake of justice. [3-45-31b, 32a]"
Aranya Kanda,45,32,"""Fie upon you, you are acrimoniously tempered owing to your faminality, and by which impulsive reason you mistrust me who am presently abiding in my brother's order, may God damn you for that crotchety. [3-45-32b, 33a]"
Aranya Kanda,45,33,"""I am going there where Rama is, oh, lady with best visage, you be blest, and oh, broad-eyed one, let all of the forest deities protect you. [3-45-33b, 34a]"
Aranya Kanda,45,34,"""Gauging by those dangerous forebodings that are now bidding fair, can I to see you again along with Rama on my return, or not? That I do not know."" Thus Lakshmana spoke to Seetha. [3-45-34b, c]"
Aranya Kanda,45,35,"When Lakshmana spoke to that wailful daughter of Janaka, she on her part spoke this curt sentence to him, while tears whelmed her to a fault."
Aranya Kanda,45,36,"""Without Rama I plunge myself in River Godavari, or else I string up myself, or discard this body of mine from heights..."" Thus Seetha started to vent out her feelings."
Aranya Kanda,45,37,"""I drink deadly poison, or I enter a flaring fire, but I will never touch another man other than Raghava."
Aranya Kanda,45,38,"Seetha on declaring to Lakshmana in this way, she who is anguished and weeping bitterly, then started to smite her belly with both of her palms in a heightened agony."
Aranya Kanda,45,39,"Observing the agonised aspect of Seetha that cheerless Saumitri started to cheer her up by repeatedly informing that her husband Rama will come soon. Even then Seetha has not spoken in the least to the brother of her husband, and maintained a silence of antipathy."
Aranya Kanda,45,40,"But then, holding Seetha in usual reverence that self-respectful Lakshmana briefly came to her fore making a reverential palm-fold that briefly, and then he proceeded to the proximity of Rama, while repeatedly looking back at that lonely lady in the thick of forest."
Aranya Kanda,46,1,"Raghava's younger brother Lakshmana is very much infuriated at Seetha who spoke to him rudely, as such he journeyed towards Rama at once as though he is yearning to see Rama immediately, albeit his heart wanted him to stand guard to Seetha."
Aranya Kanda,46,2,"Quickly taking hold of intervallic time then the ten-headed Ravana approached Vaidehi adopting an aspect of a sanyaasi, a meandering Brahman friar."
Aranya Kanda,46,3,"That sanyaasi is now cloaked in smooth silky saffron, his head-hair is neatly tufted, sandals are wooden, umbrella is on right shoulder, and on his left shoulder a shaft of sanyaasi is shouldered, onto which his handy water vessel is hooked, and he proceeded towards Vaidehi in a mien of meandering sanyaasi. [3-46-3, 4a]"
Aranya Kanda,46,4,"As with a pitchiest gloom overcoming the sunless and moonless lively eventide, that great-mighty Ravana came over to Vaidehi in that forest, when she is without two of the brothers, namely Rama and Lakshmana. [3-46-4b, 5a]"
Aranya Kanda,46,5,"As a sinister planet looks over Star Rohini when she is devoid of Moon, that extremely sinister Ravana then looked over the glorious and youthful princess Seetha. [3-46-5b, 6a]"
Aranya Kanda,46,6,"On observing ferocious Ravana whose activities are iniquitous, the trees of Janasthaana are not in full sway, nor the wind is in full swing. [3-46-6b, 7a]"
Aranya Kanda,46,7,"On seeing him who is seeing with his bloodshot eyes, River Godavari too is frightened and started to rush off quietly, whose onrush will be rapid otherwise. [3-46-7b, 8a]"
Aranya Kanda,46,8,"In the meanwhile the Decahedron demon Ravana, who is all the while waiting for some lapse of Rama, neared Vaidehi in the getup of a sanyaasi. [3-46-8b, 9a]"
Aranya Kanda,46,9,"That disgraceful Ravana made advances in a graceful mien of Brahman almsman to Vaidehi who is thinking over her husband, like the slow moving Saturn making advance to Star Citra which will be ominous. [3-46-9b, 10a]"
Aranya Kanda,46,10,"Like a wellspring shrouded by grass, enshrouded in a decent getup of a Brahman friar, in a trice Ravana leeringly stood before of Vaidehi, the admirable wife of Rama. [3-46-10b, 11a]"
Aranya Kanda,46,11,"While standing before her then Ravana eyed at the auspicious wife of Rama, whose lips and teeth are fine, visage is shiny like a full moon, and who is presently tortured by her tearful lamentation and sitting in the straw-cottage, and he approached that lotus-petal eyed Vaidehi who is dressed in ochry silks, as that night-walker is gladdened at his heart for her solitude. [3-46-11b, 12,13]"
Aranya Kanda,46,14,"He who is hit by the arrows of Love-god that king of demons Ravana, on seeing Seetha entered resonating the resonances of Vedic-hymns as precursory in seeking alms, and spoke these well-mannered sentences to her who is in solitariness."
Aranya Kanda,46,15,"Ravana really acclaimed her who is an excellent one in all the three worlds, beaming forth with the beauty of her body, and who is like Goddess Lakshmi but for Divine-lotus as Her settle, for Seetha is devoid of her settling, namely Rama."
Aranya Kanda,46,16,"""Glittering like the glitter of gold, silkened in ochry silks, you are like a lotus-tendril garlanded with divine lotuses as your ensemble, who are you?"" Thus Ravanan started addressing Seetha"
Aranya Kanda,46,17,"""Oh, rosy faced one, are you the personified numen of Respect, Renown or Resplendence, or the Felicitous Lakshmi herself, or oh, curvaceous one, are you a nymphal Apsara, or the numen of Benefactress, or a self-motivated woman, or Rati Devi, the consort of Manmatha, the Love God."
Aranya Kanda,46,18,"""Your teeth are evenly, smooth and their tips are like jasmine buds, and your whitish broad eyes are spotless, reddish at ends, and pupils are black."
Aranya Kanda,46,17,"""Your hips are beamy, thighs burly akin to elephant's trunks, and these two breasts of yours that are ornamented with best jewellery are rotund, rubbing and bumping each other, and they are swinging up and up, their nipples are brawny and jutting out, and they are smoothish like palm-fruits, thus they are covetable for they are beautiful. [3-46-19, 20]"
Aranya Kanda,46,18,"""Oh, allurer, your smile is alluring, teeth are alluring, and your eyes allure, oh, beauty, your waist is palmful, your hair velvety, your breasts are jostling, and you rob my soul as a spate robs riverbank. [3-46-21, 22a]"
Aranya Kanda,46,19,"""I have not hitherto seen any earthly female with this kind of features on the face of earth; or, a goddess - no; a gandharva female - no; yaksha female - no; kinnaraa female - no, none whosoever! [3-46-22b, 23a]"
Aranya Kanda,46,20,"""I marvel why an excellent one in all the three worlds by her features, more so, fragile and youthful as yourself should be living here in the thick of forest. [3-46-23b, 24, 25a]"
Aranya Kanda,46,21,"Such as you are you go back, let safety betide you, as you are unsuited to live in here, for this forest is the dwelling for ghastly demons who by their wish will be changing their guise. [3-46-24b, 25a]"
Aranya Kanda,46,22,"""Delightful rooftops of skyscrapers, flourishing and richly fragranced pleasure-gardens of cities alone are meetly to you to saunter. [3-46-25b, 26a]"
Aranya Kanda,46,23,"Oh, beauteous lady, I opine that only best garlands, best scents, best foodstuffs, best clothing are meetly to you, oh, lady with black pupils, hence it is meet and right to you to have a best husband."
Aranya Kanda,46,24,"""Getting at you, the garlands, scents, foodstuffs, or clothing, they all become the best, because you are the best beauteous one, as such, he alone becomes a best person who gets you as his wife, and it is meet and right to you to choose such a husband, [aside: me alone.] [3-46-26b, 27a]"
Aranya Kanda,46,25,"""Oh, curvaceous lady, who are you? Oh, one with an impeccable smile, do you belong to Rudraa-gods, or Marut-gods, or to Vasu-s? To me you are beaming forth like a goddess. [3-46-27b, 28a]"
Aranya Kanda,46,26,"""This is the dwelling-place of demons, and no goddess, nor a gandharva, nor a kinnara can arrive here, but how you have come here? [3-46-28b, 29a]"
Aranya Kanda,46,27,"""Here, simians, lions, leopards, tigers, likewise other predators, bears, tigers, vultures will be moving. How you are not frightened from them? [3-46-29b, 30a]"
Aranya Kanda,46,28,"""Being alone in this forest, oh, lady with a lovely face, how you are unafraid of horrendous and mighty elephants possessed of rut? [3-46-30b, 31a]"
Aranya Kanda,46,29,"""Oh, auspicious lady, who are you? Whose are you? Also from where are you? And being lonely, what for you are moving in dreadful Dandaka forest that is adored by demons?"" Thus Ravana spoke to Seetha. [3-46-31, 32b]"
Aranya Kanda,46,30,"When the wicked minded Ravana praised her in this way, Vaidehi the princess from Mithila has seen him who has arrived in the getup of Brahman and started to revere him with all the respects affordable to a casual guest. [3-46-32b, 33]"
Aranya Kanda,46,34,"She firstly fetched a seat him, then invited him with water for feet-wash, and then said to him who looked gracious in his bearing, 'alms are ready.'"
Aranya Kanda,46,32,"Maithili explored him who arrived with the features of a Brahman, with a saffron-robe and alms-bowl, and finding no reason to refute him flatly, as he has come like a Brahman, she invited him as a Brahman."
Aranya Kanda,46,35,"Maithili explored him who arrived with the features of a Brahman, with a saffron-robe and alms-bowl, and as he came with an unimperilling appearance of a Brahman, she invited him as she would ordinarily invite a real Brahman."
Aranya Kanda,46,36,"""Oh, Brahman, this is the Darbha-grass-seat and you be seated comfortably, here is water, receive it for hand and feet wash, here is the forest grown victuals for your sake... dine on them relaxedly..."" Thus Seetha said to Ravana."
Aranya Kanda,46,37,"Ravana thoroughly observed that wife of the king, Maithili, when she invited him talking civilities contextual in inviting a guest, that too Brahman sanyasi, and he firmed up his mind to abduct her even forcibly, and started to dedicate himself for destruction."
Aranya Kanda,46,38,"Then she looked forward for her shapely husband who has gone on a hunting game, and who must be returning along with Lakshmana, and though she looked intently she could only see the green backdrop of that great forest, but not Rama or Lakshmana."
Aranya Kanda,47,1,"When Ravana whose intention is to abduct her has enquired thus, then on the basis of his Brahman friar's mien Seetha informed about herself on her own."
Aranya Kanda,47,2,"Thinking briefly that, 'he is a Brahman and an untimely guest, he will indeed curse me if he is not replied,' Seetha spoke this sentence."
Aranya Kanda,47,3,"""I am the daughter of noble-souled Janaka, the king of Mithila, by name I am Seetha, and the dear wife and queen of Rama, let safety betide you."
Aranya Kanda,47,4,"""On residing in the residence of Ikshvaku-s in Ayodhya for twelve years, I was in sumptuosity of all cherishes while relishing all humanly prosperities."

Aranya Kanda,47,7,"""Restraining my veracious father-in-law by a good deed once done by her in his respect, Kaikeyi besought two boons from him, namely expatriation of my husband, and anointment of her son Bharata. [3-47-7, 8a]"
Aranya Kanda,47,8,""" 'If Rama is anointed now, come what may I will not eat, sleep, or drink, and my life ends this way,' thus Kaikeyi was adamantine, and the king and my father-in-law entreated her who is nagging with meaningful riches, but she did not make good on that entreaty.

Aranya Kanda,47,9,"""My great-resplendent husband was of twenty-five years of age at that time, and to me eighteen years are reckoned up from my birth. [3-47-10b, 11a]"

Aranya Kanda,47,50,"On closely marking Seetha to be tremulous, he that Ravana whose impetus is Death similar, clearly informed her of his name, caste, competency, and capability as his purpose is to cause scare."
Aranya Kanda,48,1,"When Seetha spoke thus Ravana is embittered, and knitting his eyebrows he indeed spoke these rudish words to Seetha."
Aranya Kanda,48,2,"""I am known as Ravana, oh, lady with superb complexion, let safety betide you, the highly valorous and ten-headed stepbrother of Kubera."
Aranya Kanda,48,3,"""I am that Ravana at whose sight all the gods together with gandharva-s, evil-spirits, birds and snakes will always be frightened and fleeing, as with the people frightened and fleeing from death."
Aranya Kanda,48,4,"""I am that Ravana who when infuriated for some other reason took up a duel with Kubera, his brother from stepparent, wherein that Kubera is set up against and completely trounced in a combat."
Aranya Kanda,48,5,"""I am that Ravana by whom Kubera, the god for Wealth-Management whose vehicular transport is handled by humans, is tormented fearfully and made to completely abandon his wealthiest place which is presided over by him till then, and I am the one who made that Kubera to flee to the excellent Mt. Kailash where he is somehow living, because I will not cause any harm on Mt. Kailash as I hold it sacred."
Aranya Kanda,48,6,"""I am that Ravana, oh, auspicious lady, who just by his valour acquired Kubera's auspicious aircraft known as Pushpaka, whose pilotage is just by the wish of its aviator, with which I will be travelling in skies."
Aranya Kanda,48,7,"""Just by seeing rancour-shot face of mine, oh, Maithili, all the gods will quickly shoot off, even if Indra is leading them, then where is the question of their confronting me."
Aranya Kanda,48,8,"""Where I will be staying there the Air-god wafts doubtfully, lest his gusts and blasts may hurt me, and the Sun also effectuates his singeing sunbeams as cooling moonbeams, lest I may abduct his wife Prabha, the Sunshine."
Aranya Kanda,48,9,"""At places where I will be staying or freely moving there the leaves of trees will be less of rustle, lest I may wilt them up, and there the gush of water of rivers too will quieten, lest I may dry them up."
Aranya Kanda,48,10,"""My magnificent city known as Lanka is there on the other shore of the ocean, plethoric with all kinds of amenities, as well as with ghastly demons, which city will be on par with Indra's Amaravati, but for meekly gods and meaningless souls."
Aranya Kanda,48,11,"""That gorgeous city is completely walled in with compound walls that are adorned with whitish silver, and its palace-chambers are golden, and its archways are fully jewelled with lapis jewels."
Aranya Kanda,48,12,"""It is encumbered with elephants, horses and chariots, well sounded by the sounds of trumpets, and with trees which yield fruits that fulfil all the savours, and it is bedecked with chirrupy pleasure-gardens."
Aranya Kanda,48,13,"""Oh, princess, oh, self-respectful lady, if you reside there together with me, hÃ¨, Seetha, then you will not think of yourself as one from among human females."
Aranya Kanda,48,14,"""Revelling in humanly luxuries, over and beyond in heavenly luxuries also, you will not recollect humanly Rama, whose longevity is lessened."
Aranya Kanda,48,15,"""Though Rama is the eldest son, king Dasharatha established his dear son Bharata as king, and because Rama is spineless he is put to flight to forests, and now, what is he and what am I, in matter of sovereignty."
Aranya Kanda,48,16,"""Rama is subverted from kingdom, thus dwindled is valour, thus winded down is his anima, thus he has become a pitiable one, thus he became an ascetic as nothing else is there for him to undertake, oh, broad-eyed lady, what do you aspire to do with such a Rama?"
Aranya Kanda,48,17,"""I, the king of all the demons, am hit by the arrows of Love-god and came to you in love, and instead of beseeching me to love you, your rejection and speaking this way, is unapt of you."
Aranya Kanda,48,17,"""Although I am the king of all the demons, on seeing you I am hit by the arrows of Love-god and came to you, thus you love me... but rejecting me this way is unapt of you, as you alone will be loosing heavenly comforts, if you reject me."
Aranya Kanda,48,18,"""Oh, modest lady, on refusing me you surely become remorseful like Uurvashi who once kicked Puruurava with her feet."
Aranya Kanda,48,19,"""He that Rama is merely a human, and in war he equals me not by my finger, oh, richly colourful lady, and I chanced here merely by your serendipity, thus you honour me and my desire to possess you..."" Thus Ravana spoke to Seetha."
Aranya Kanda,48,20,Vaidehi who is spoken thus is infuriated on her part and with her eyes bloodshot spoke these bitter words to the king of demons in that lonely lace.
Aranya Kanda,48,21,"""How you wish to commit sins although saying that Kubera, a god reverenced by all of the gods, is your brother?"
Aranya Kanda,48,22,"""All the demons will perforce get completely destroyed, oh, Ravana, for whom you the cruel and culpable one with uncontrolled senses is the king, and you will be blameworthy for the elimination of righteous demons like Vibheeshana, et al."
Aranya Kanda,48,23,"""It may be possible to live after abducting Shaci Devi, the wife of Indra, somehow and anyhow there will be no liveability after abducting me, the wife of Rama."
Aranya Kanda,48,24,"""Oh, demon, un-mirrored is the prettiness of prettyish Shaci Devi, and one may live long on forcibly snatching her away from the hands of the wielder of Thunderbolt, Indra, but to him who intimidates or abuses me or women like me, there will be no moksha, release from the cycle of rebirth, even if he has consumed amR^ita ambrosia."" Thus Seetha spoke to Ravana."
Aranya Kanda,49,1,On hearing Seetha's words that valorous ten-headed Ravana loudly clapped in dissent for once and divulged his very mighty body.
Aranya Kanda,49,2,"That wordsmith Ravana again spoke these words to Maithili, ""Perhaps you have not heard about my valour and vanquishes in all your madness for Rama."
Aranya Kanda,49,3,"""Standing on the sky I can lift up the earth with two of my arms, I can completely gulp down any ocean, standing in war I can even put the Death to death."
Aranya Kanda,49,4,"""Indeed, I can split the Sun and splinter the earth with my splitting arrows, oh, mad woman, I can assume any form as I wish, and endow any wish you wish, such as I am, I must be your husband, behold me."" So said Ravana when revealing his real nature."
Aranya Kanda,49,5,While the infuriated Ravana is saying in that way his eyes which by themselves are torchlit in their shine have became further bloodshot and blackened at their edges.
Aranya Kanda,49,6,"Immediately discarding the gentle form of a Brahman friar, that younger brother of Kubera, Ravana, assumed his own ferocious form which is similar to the form of Terminator."
Aranya Kanda,49,7,"That celebrated Ravana whose eyes are bloodshot as he is ensorcelled by desperate fury transmuted his form into a tend-faced, twenty-armed night-walker wearing golden ornaments of purified gold and appearing as a black tempestuous cloud. [3-49-7, 8a]"
Aranya Kanda,49,8,"On discarding that guise of a Brahman friar that sovereign of demons Ravana educed his own physique and then that mighty bodied one attired in reddish clothing stood before Maithili observing that gem of a lady. [3-49-8b, 9]"
Aranya Kanda,49,10,"She whose tresses are glossily blackish until their ends, and who has on her glittering jewellery and silken-ochry-sari, whereby who is imperceivable like sun's glaring shine, to such Maithili Ravana spoke."
Aranya Kanda,49,11,"""If you wish to have a husband of well-renown in three worlds you seek shelter in me, oh, high-hipped lady, I alone will match up to you as husband."
Aranya Kanda,49,11,"""Ultimately you have a much-lauded husband in me, as such you oblige me, and I will not cause any displeasure to you at any point of time. Let your heart refrain from that humanly Rama and you start bringing round your heart towards me. [3-49-12, 13a]"
Aranya Kanda,49,12,"""Oh, halfwitted lady, you who deem yourself a highly intellectual lady, listen, that mindless Rama who just by a word of a woman forebode kingdom along with all of his amiable people, and lives in this forest where the predators are on the prowl, thus he who is spurned off from kingdom, ungainful are his purposes, and who is even a short-lived human, I wonder by what merits you are impassioned for such a Rama?"" Thus Ravana spoke to Seetha. [3-49-13b, 14, 15a]"
Aranya Kanda,49,13,"On saying that sentence to Maithili, who by herself is a nice talker and who is a proper one for addressing with nice words, that verily evil-minded demon Ravana maddened by lust drew nigh of Seetha and grabbed her, as Budha, the Jupiter grabs the Star Rohini in firmament. [3-49-15b, 16]"
Aranya Kanda,49,17,"He that Ravana grabbed the lotus-eyed Seetha on lifting her up with his left hand at her plait of hair at nape, and with his right hand at her thighs."
Aranya Kanda,49,18,"On seeing him who grabbed Seetha, who has incisive fangs, mightily armed and who is shining forth like a mountain crest and similar to Death, the forest deities quickly fled away terrorised by his terrorism."
Aranya Kanda,49,19,"Then the miracle-air-chariot of Ravana which is miraculously designed to appear and disappear at the wish of its master, yoked with miraculous mules, and built with its golden wheels and parts, appeared afore Ravana braying noisily."
Aranya Kanda,49,20,Then he whose voice is strident that Ravana lifted her up by her waist and got Vaidehi up on the air-chariot intimidating her with bitter words.
Aranya Kanda,49,21,"Agonised with anguish when gone into the captivity of Ravana, she that glorious Seetha wailed loudly for Rama saying 'oh, Rama,' which Rama has gone deep into the forest by then."
Aranya Kanda,49,22,"Ravana who is infatuated with lust picked her up, which lady is disinclined for any kind of sensuality and who is verily writhing like the wife of King Cobra, and then he surged skyward and flew off with her in his air-chariot."
Aranya Kanda,49,23,"While that lord of demons is abducting her in the skyway, Seetha became frenzied with bewildered faculties and then bawled stridently like a hysterical person."
Aranya Kanda,49,24,"""Haa, greatly dextrous Lakshmana... oh, rejoicer of your mentor... you are incognisant of me who am being abducted by this demon who is a dissembler."
Aranya Kanda,49,5,"""Oh, Raghava, you have relinquished your high-life, happiness, and riches for the sake of righteousness, and though you avowed to protect your observants, you are unobservant of me who am being abducted by the unrighteousness itself."
Aranya Kanda,49,26,"""Oh, enemy-inflamer Rama, I reckon that you are an absolute controller of uncontrollable beings, I wonder why you are not controlling this kind of sinner, Ravana, indeed?"" This is how Seetha started her cry in wilderness."
Aranya Kanda,49,27,"""Indeed, the result for an evil act will not be apparent instantaneously. Even the time becomes a factor in the matter of cause and effect, as with the crops becoming cookable after certain time lag."" Thus, she is addressing Ravana now."
Aranya Kanda,49,28,"""The Time has battered your brains and as an infringer you have undertaken this particular exploit, whereby you will get a devastating and life-ending tribulation from Rama."" Thus, she upbraided Ravana."
Aranya Kanda,49,29,"""An honest wife of a glorious one who aspires nothing but honesty, such a wife of Rama as I am, I am being abducted, thus the aspiration of Kaikeyi and her kinfolk has now come true. Oh, god!"" Thus, she soliloquised."
Aranya Kanda,49,30,"""I call the attention of the flowered Karnikaara trees of Janasthaana, you inform Rama that Ravana is thieving Seetha."" Thus, she is addressing the woods and others on the ground from air-chariot."
Aranya Kanda,49,31,"""I pray you who are with the bustle of swans and saarasa water birds, oh, River Godavari, you promptly tell Rama that Ravana is thieving Seetha."
Aranya Kanda,49,32,"""I also venerate you, the sylvan deities that travel in this forest with diverse trees or, those that abide on the treetops, you may please inform my husband that I am being stolen."
Aranya Kanda,49,33,"""Or, over there, some few beings that are living over there on the ground below, I seek shelter of all the flocks of birds and hoards of animals, and I pray you to convey this news."
Aranya Kanda,49,34,"""Inform my husband about his dear and loftier wife than his lives, saying that, 'helpless Seetha is stolen by Ravana.'"
Aranya Kanda,49,35,"""If that ambidextrous Rama comes to know about me, even if I am taken to heavens, or, even if I am impounded by Death, that great-mighty Rama brings me back, on aggressing against all of the gods in heaven, or, against Yama, the Death God."" Thus, she appealed to one and all, but in vain."
Aranya Kanda,49,36,She that wide-eyed Seetha who is highly anguished and bewailing with pitiable words then with a wide-eyed expectancy saw the eagle Jatayu perching on a tree.
Aranya Kanda,49,37,"She that well-waisted lady who has gone into the captivity of Ravana craned and stared at the eagle, and worsted by fear she shrieked squeakily with a stuttering voice that is walloped with anguish."
Aranya Kanda,49,38,"""Oh, fatherly Jatayu, see me, like an orphanized one I am pitiably abducted by this lord of demons with sinister deeds."
Aranya Kanda,49,39,"""It is impossible for you to forestall this merciless night-walker, for he is formidable, shining forth with cunning conquests, also thus this wicked minded one is with weaponry."
Aranya Kanda,49,40,"""Oh, Jatayu, everything about my abduction shall be narrated to Rama, or to Lakshmana, as it has happened in its entirety."" Thus Seetha supplicated Jatayu."
Aranya Kanda,50,1,Jataayu who is slumbering away craned and stared on hearing the voicing of Seetha and then he saw Ravana and even Vaidehi.
Aranya Kanda,50,2,"That best bird majestic Jataayu with a very sharp beak and appearing like a mountain peak, then uttered these words of expediency still perching on a tree."
Aranya Kanda,50,3,"""Oh, brother, now it is inapt of you to undertake a deplorable deed. I am one of those who abide by perpetual probity and avowed to truthfulness. Such as I am, oh, Decahedral-demon Ravana, I am the mightiest king of eagles known by the name Jataayu. [3-50-3, 4a]"
Aranya Kanda,50,4,"""Rama, the son of Dasharatha, is the master of all the world, one similar to Mahendra and Varuna, the Rain-god, and the one who is connected with the well-being of all the world. [3-50-4b, 5a]"
Aranya Kanda,50,5,"""Whom you desire to abduct now, that best lady is Seetha by her name, and this glorious one is the legitimate wife of that preserver of all the worlds, namely Rama. [3-50-5b, 6a]"
Aranya Kanda,50,6,"""How a king adhering to probity can lay his hands on the wives of others? If it is a king's wife, oh, great-mighty Ravana, she is to be safeguarded particularly. [3-50-6b, 7a]"
Aranya Kanda,50,7,"""Reverse your filthy course, or fortuity, or mind form laying your hands on other's wives. A sagacious person does not undertake that deed by which others deplore him. As with the protection of one's own wife from somebody's laying hands on her, other person's wife is also to be protected in that way. [3-50-8 [3-50-7b, 8]"
Aranya Kanda,50,9,"""If the means to gain probity, or prosperities, or even pleasures are inconspicuous in scriptures, oh, the scion of Paulastya, then even the erudite scholars will conduct themselves following the king and his demeanour."
Aranya Kanda,50,10,"""A king is the best repository for probity, prosperities, and pleasures, and whether it is probity or felicity or even iniquity that will emerge from the fount called king."
Aranya Kanda,50,10,"""Oh, prominent one among demons, deviltry and mercuriality are but natural for you demons, but how you have amassed affluence, as with an evildoer attaining an aircraft that puts him to flight to heaven."
Aranya Kanda,50,11,"""You by your nature are a devilish and mercurial personality though you have come from a decent lineage, how you have become an outranking demon among demons and how you could attain kingdom, which is to be ruled righteously, like an evildoer attaining a heaven-bound aircraft."
Aranya Kanda,50,12,"""He whose nature is such, that nature is perhaps impossible to efface, a sermon does not dwell in the heart of an evil-minded one for a long time, indeed."
Aranya Kanda,50,12,"""He whose nature itself is vile, it is perhaps impossible for him to efface it, and in the residence of such an evil-minded person, evilly acquired prosperity does not dwell for a long time, indeed."
Aranya Kanda,50,13,"""When that great-mighty Rama has not transgressed either in your country or in your city Lanka, then how you become a transgressor in respect of that noble-souled Rama?"
Aranya Kanda,50,15,"""If Rama of indefatigable deeds firstly eliminated Khara who is stationed at Janasthaana, and who transgressed for the sake of Shuurpanakha, tell me what in actuality is the highly overstepping behaviour of Rama in that matter, whereupon you are stealing off with the wife of such a lord of world? [3-50-14, 15]"
Aranya Kanda,50,16,"""Instantly deliver up Vaidehi. Let not the disastrous and glowing fire-like eyes of Rama, which transmogrify so when he assumes fury, burn you down as the Thunderbolt of Indra once burnt the demon Vritta."
Aranya Kanda,50,17,"""You are unconscious that you have presently bundled a lethally venomous serpent at the fringe of your attire, and you are equally unwary that the Terminator's lasso is presently loosened around your neck."
Aranya Kanda,50,18,"""Oh, cultured one, that weight alone is to be shouldered by which a man is not brought down, and that repast alone is to be consumed by which nothing upsets."
Aranya Kanda,50,19,"""Who will undertake a deed that yields neither probity, nor deference, nor distinction but results in just physical drudgery?"
Aranya Kanda,50,20,"""I have dedicated myself to the kingdom of my fathers and forefathers according to tradition, and sixty thousand years have elapsed since I was born."
Aranya Kanda,50,21,"""You are youngish whereas I am oldish, you are an armoured archer darting arrows from an air-chariot, whereas I am pensile bird in an open sky. Nevertheless, on taking Vaidehi you cannot abscond safely."
Aranya Kanda,50,22,"""It will be incapable of you to forcibly abduct Vaidehi when I keep an eye one her, as with the defilement of definitive Vedic scriptures by the logicians, dialecticians, materialists and suchlike non-believers, with their conjectural logic."
Aranya Kanda,50,22,"""Veda-s are definitive in their canons and their authority is established beyond doubt, yet the doubtful scholarly logicians still try to pamper their import with their conjectural logic, and when I am watchful of what is going on I do not let you pamper Seetha, as such take this caution and release her."
Aranya Kanda,50,23,"""Stay for a moment, oh, Ravana, if you are valiant enough you can combat with Rama who will return right away, and at his hand you will be slain and sprawling on earth in the same way as Khara sprawled earlier."
Aranya Kanda,50,24,"""He who eliminated demons and ogres in combats time after time, that Rama though apparently attired in jute-cloths like a meek-saint, will become a towering-inferno in a given combat, and he eliminates you very soon."
Aranya Kanda,50,25,"""What can possibly be done by me when those princes have gone far-off! It is beyond the scope of my fetching them in time! You knave, you who are scared of them will now be lost to my blockade, without a doubt."
Aranya Kanda,50,26,"""When I am alive you cannot lead away this auspicious, lotus-leave-eyed Seetha, the dear queen of Rama."
Aranya Kanda,50,27,"""But I must definitely accomplish something to forestall you till they come, for I cannot willingly depart from here to fetch any of the two brothers, and that deed I needs must do shall be agreeable to the great-souled Rama, likewise even to Dasharatha, even at the stake of my life."
Aranya Kanda,50,28,"""Stopoff! Stopoff! Oh, Decahedral Ravana, briefly learn of me as how I jettison you from your best air-chariot, as with the unloading of a burdensome fruit from its sepals. Oh, nightwalker, I will be giving guestship to you in a duel as long as I am alive."
Aranya Kanda,51,1,"When Ravana is spoken to by Jataayu with judicious words, Ravana's eyes reddened infuriately, and his burnished golden ear-knobs flickered injuriously, and that lord of demons dashed towards the lord of birds, intolerantly."
Aranya Kanda,51,2,"As with two gigantic clouds up-heaved by the tornadic gusts will be hard hitting each other tempestuously in sky, the combat between those two, Ravana and Jataayu, became tempestuous in the sky."
Aranya Kanda,51,3,"As with a startling combat between two gigantic and winged mountains, called Mt. Maalyavanta-s, that combat between the eagle and demon then became a startling one."
Aranya Kanda,51,4,"Then the great-mighty Ravana incessantly stormed the lord of eagles Jataayu, with arrows that have excruciating and highly dreadful arrowheads, like tubular arrows, iron arrows, and with arrows that have crescentic arrowheads."
Aranya Kanda,51,5,"That eagle Jataayu who is the lord of winged-chariots, namely birds, in turn sustained those arrays of Ravana's arrows in that combat."
Aranya Kanda,51,6,But that great-mighty Jataayu severally made gashes on the body of Ravana with his two feet that have gashing claws for that bird is with best stamina.
Aranya Kanda,51,7,"Now the Decahedral demon Ravana infuriately took up ten deadly arrows that are similar in their shine to the Shafts of the Terminator, wishful of the elimination of his enemy."
Aranya Kanda,51,8,"That highly energetic Ravana released and impaled the eagle with straight shooting arrows on fully stretching the bowstring up to his ear, whose steel-pointed arrowheads are sharp, hurtful, and deadly."
Aranya Kanda,51,9,That Jataayu on seeing teary-eyed Jaanaki in the chariot of the demon forcefully lunged towards that demon heedless of arrows that are lunging at him.
Aranya Kanda,51,10,"That unexcelled bird of high refulgence then shattered Ravana's bow which is decorated with pearls and gemstones, and on which an arrow is admitted targeting the eagle, just by the pair of his bare feet."
Aranya Kanda,51,11,Ravana convulsed in anger then took up another bow and stormed hundreds and thousands of arrow storms.
Aranya Kanda,51,12,Nested in the arrows shot by Ravana that lordly bird Jataayu then shone forth in that combat like a bird that obtains a readymade nest.
Aranya Kanda,51,13,"On winnowing those arrays of arrows with both of his wings, he that highly refulgent Jataayu shattered the mighty bow of Ravana with both of his feet."
Aranya Kanda,51,14,"That highly resplendent lord of birds also blasted off the armour of Ravana, which is glowing and flamelike in its flare, with both of his feet."
Aranya Kanda,51,15,Mighty Jataayu also knocked off the ghost-faced mules yoked to the chariot of Ravana which are covered in golden armours and tantivy in fastness.
Aranya Kanda,51,16,"Then that great-chariot which is flourishing with three bamboos from chassis to yoke, and which traverses just by its steersman's wish, and which is crafted fantastically with gem-studded body and stairs, or, whose wheels are crafted with gold and gemstones, and which in its flare is like a Ritual-fire, Jataayu splintered down even that chariot of Ravana."
Aranya Kanda,51,17,"Jataayu swiftly collapsed the parasol of Ravana which in shine is mirroring the full moon, along with the regalia of white-royal-fur-fans, together with the demons handling them for fanning Ravana."
Aranya Kanda,51,18,Again that highly energetic and imposing king of birds pecked off the robust head of the charioteer of Ravana with beak.
Aranya Kanda,51,19,"Now Ravana who is with his devastated bow, devoid of chariot, dispatched are his horses and departed is his charioteer, and such as he is, he on grabbing Vaidehi by her torso, or, placing her on the lower end of his torso, jumped to earth."
Aranya Kanda,51,20,"On seeing Ravana who is foundered onto earth from his crumbled vehicle, all beings like sylvan deities, caarana-s, siddha-s and suchlike, reverenced that lordly eagle Jataayu."
Aranya Kanda,51,21,"But on seeing the commandant of birds Jataayu is fatigued owing to his senescence, Ravana is gladdened and he again rose up to skies taking Maithili."
Aranya Kanda,51,22,"The highly resplendent king of eagles Jataayu swiftly rose to sky dashing practically to forestall Ravana, which demon's assault devices are all demolished by now save for a single sword, but who is cheerful to spirit away the daughter of Janaka, and actually spiriting away holding her onto his flank, and Jataayu spoke this to such Ravana. [3-51-22, 23]"
Aranya Kanda,51,24,"""You mean-minded Ravana, you abduct her whose husband wields arrows that touch off like the Thunderbolt of Indra, and this spite of yours is definitely for the destruction of all the demons."
Aranya Kanda,51,25,"""As one thirsteth drinketh water, you drinketh venomous drink along with your friends, relatives, ministers, armies, and with your accomplices, as this abduction of Seetha itself is squirrelling away dangerous poison."
Aranya Kanda,51,26,"""As with the mindless adventurers quickly getting ruination for they undertake self-ruinous exploits, unknowing the backlashes thereof, so also you too will ruin that quickly with this mindless adventure."
Aranya Kanda,51,27,"""You are tethered for termination with the lasso of the Terminator, as with a fish that can go nowhere on its biting fishhook with a piece of flesh. How do you untether yourself from that lasso of the Terminator, even if you go anywhere?"
Aranya Kanda,51,28,"""But, oh Ravana, the unassailable Raghava-s of Kakutstha dynasty will nevermore condone your assailing this hermitage."
Aranya Kanda,51,29,"""Like a dastard you are committing a crime of thieving Seetha when none at home in the footsteps of thieves, this thieving is contemptible to society and condemnable by valiant ones."
Aranya Kanda,51,23,"""Stay for a moment, oh, Ravana, if you are valiant enough you can combat with Rama who will return right away, and at his hand you will be slain and sprawling on earth in the same way as Khara sprawled earlier."
Aranya Kanda,51,31,"""A person undertakes such an unrighteous and fateful activity if only death looms large on him. You too have undertaken this unrighteous fateful activity only for your self-ruination."
Aranya Kanda,51,32,"""If sin is consequential to any given activity who will undertake it? Even if that person vies with the Self-Born God and Lord of the Universe, namely Brahma, will he undertake it?"" Thus Jataayu advised Ravana."
Aranya Kanda,51,33,"Even on speaking those commonsensical words to Ravana, Jataayu found him carrying off Seetha heedlessly, then that valorous Jataayu descended on the hind-side of that Decahedral demon Ravana, devastatingly."
Aranya Kanda,51,34,"On clasping Ravana with incisive claws Jataayu lacerated deeply and rampantly, as a mahout, an elephant-trainer-controller, sitting astride on it will try to control an uncontrollable elephant that is running amok with an incisive goad."
Aranya Kanda,51,35,"Weaponed only with his claws, wings, and beak, Jataayu not only tore the back of Ravana asunder applying his beak and claws, but started to tweeze even his hair."
Aranya Kanda,51,36,"His lips becoming intolerantly quivery when Ravana is exasperated by that king of eagles repetitiously, that demon staggered on to his right targeting the hovering eagle at his hind-side to fell it down."
Aranya Kanda,51,37,Ravana who is aggrieved and convulsed in fury hit back Jataayu with his palm while firmly clutching Vaidehi onto his left flank.
Aranya Kanda,51,38,"Jataayu, the lord of birds, being a vanquisher of enemies outstripped Ravana and ripped off ten left-arms of Ravana with his beak, with which left arms Ravana is clutching Vaidehi, in order to release her from his clutches."
Aranya Kanda,51,39,"Though his arms are mutilated thus, they instantaneously ricocheted from his body like snakes possessing a series of venomous blazes sprawling out from a snake pit."
Aranya Kanda,51,40,"The valorous Decahedron Ravana then threw off Seetha, and out of fury he scuffled with the king of eagles with fisticuffs and kicks, by both his feet and fists."
Aranya Kanda,51,41,"Then there chanced an encounter for some time between those two valorous ones with mutually outweighing capabilities, namely the chieftain of demons and the chief of the birds."
Aranya Kanda,51,42,"Ravana brandishing his sword at Jataayu, who is revolting for the sake of Rama, hewed off both of his wings, sides, and feet."
Aranya Kanda,51,43,When that demon of cruel actions has ruptured his wings that colossal eagle Jataayu immediately fell down to earth with a lessened life.
Aranya Kanda,51,44,On seeing Jataayu fallen on earth and dampened with blood Vaidehi fell into a fit of weeping and ran towards him as if he is her own relative.
Aranya Kanda,51,45,"Ravana, the monarch of Lanka, gazed at that worthily valorous Jataayu, who in his shine is like a blue-black cloud with a whitely white chest and who by now is like a quiescent fire-storm flattened onto ground."
Aranya Kanda,51,46,"But then Seetha, the daughter of Janaka, whose face vies with moonshine hugged eagle Jataayu, whom Ravana has subjugated with his forcefulness and felled down onto the surface of earth, and she wept over incessantly."
Aranya Kanda,52,1,Seetha whose visage is like a full moon wept on gazing the king of eagles Jataayu whom Ravana nearly killed.
Aranya Kanda,52,2,"""Humans definitely perceive either agony or ecstasy by its concomitant happenings, or by the characteristics of uncommon reflexes of their own body parts, or by the presages, or by conjecturable concomitants, or by cognising calls of birds."
Aranya Kanda,52,3,"""Oh, Rama, for sure you are not able to know about big catastrophe called my kidnap is chancing on you, even though oh, Kakutstha, these animals and birds are running towards you surely for my sake, to tell about me."
Aranya Kanda,52,4,"""Oh, Rama, this sky flier Jataayu who mercifully came here to save me is verily mangled on his encountering Ravana, and he is sprawling on earth, indeed by my ill luck."" Thus Seetha wailed."
Aranya Kanda,52,5,"That best lady who is very highly panicked bawled noisily, ""oh, Rama of Kakutstha... oh, Lakshmana... liberate me now..."" as though the addressees are before her."
Aranya Kanda,52,6,"That sovereign of demons, Ravana, rushed towards Vaidehi whose garlands and jewellery are muddled up and who is bawling like an orphanized one."
Aranya Kanda,52,7,"Ravana, the lord of demons, has repeatedly and harshly taunted Seetha saying, 'leave it off, leave it off...' when Seetha devoid of Rama in that timberland is clinging and muffling a sturdy tree like a climber plant, and bawling, 'Rama, Rama,' and that demon whose shine is similar to the Death has clutched her hair loosened from her bun, as death loomed large on him. [3-52-7, 8]"
Aranya Kanda,52,9,"While Vaidehi is insulted thus, entire world together with its mobile or sessile beings became chaotic, and there chanced a blanketing of a blinding blackness, and waft-less is the Wind and shine-less is the Sun."
Aranya Kanda,52,9,"On seeing Seetha's appropriation by an inappropriate being with His clairvoyant eyes, the illustrious Grandparent of Universe Brahma declared, ""the deed is done..."" but all of the supreme sages in Brahma's abode on seeing Seetha in such a condition became despondent, and yet delighted in foreseeing results. [3-52-10b, 11a]"
Aranya Kanda,52,12,"On seeing Seetha's appropriation by an impropriate being, the dwellers in Dandaka forest cognised that Ravana's annihilation has chanced coincidentally."
Aranya Kanda,52,13,"Ravana, the lord of demons, on wresting Seetha who is bawling, ""Rama... Rama..."" also thus as, ""Lakshmana..."" took flight skyward."
Aranya Kanda,52,14,"That princess Seetha scintillated like the oblique flashes of lightning in a cloud, owing to her golden coloured body which is muffled up with jewellery of pure gold, and added with a golden coloured ocherish silky dress, while traversing in the sky."
Aranya Kanda,52,15,"When her ochreish silk sari's upper fringe is upheaved by air onto to Ravana, Ravana looked blazing like a mountain set ablaze, muchly and overly."
Aranya Kanda,52,16,"Reddish and scented lotus-petals adorning that highly auspicious Seetha have slithered, but again upheaved by air they are bestrewn on Ravana."
Aranya Kanda,52,17,"Upper fringe of Seetha's silk sari with golden glitter is upheaved in the sky, and with the reddish hue of sun in red heat of midday it beamed forth like a reddish cloud."
Aranya Kanda,52,18,As with a stalk-less lotus the immaculate visage of Seetha is unbright in the sky when she is on the flank of Ravana as Rama is not in vicinage.
Aranya Kanda,52,17,"Her lotus pistil like un-pimply face is adorned with a pretty forehead on which prettyish curls are fluttering, and with teeth that are spick and span and sparkling, but tears dabbed on that face to sideways when she wept, yet it is pleasant like moon for a sight with shapely nose, pretty eyes, roseate lips, and shining with golden hue in sky. Nevertheless, when she has gone in the flank of Ravana on the sky such an immaculate face of Seetha turned like a palish moon that has just risen bursting a bluish cloud. [3-52-19, 20, 21]"
Aranya Kanda,52,22,"Highly disconcerted by the king of demons that auspicious face of Seetha is unbright like the moon arisen in daytime with somewhat golden hue, owing to the absence of Rama."
Aranya Kanda,52,19,She that golden coloured Maithili who is moored by the blackish-bodied sovereign of demons shone forth like a sapphirine gemstone studded in a golden cincture.
Aranya Kanda,52,23,She that golden coloured Maithili who is moored by the blackish-bodied sovereign of demons shone forth like a golden cincture girded to an elephant.
Aranya Kanda,52,24,"Seetha, the daughter of Janaka, with a complexion that is goldenly yellowish in the tinge of a lotus, moreover with her ornaments of purified gold, flashed like a lightning possessed in a dark-cloud, when that stonehearted Ravana possessed her."
Aranya Kanda,52,25,With the rustles of Vaidehi's jewellery that lord of demons shone forth like a shipshape blue-black cloud with rumbles and undulating lightning.
Aranya Kanda,52,26,"Flowers gracing her best body on her head, in garlands on chest, and on armlets have fallen all-over the surface of earth like showers of flowers while she is being abducted."
Aranya Kanda,52,27,"Though that flower-shower has fallen all-over, it is windswept by the speed of Ravana, and fell again on that Decahedral demon."
Aranya Kanda,52,28,"Like the garland of pristine stars that circles round the loftiest Mt. Meru, that flower-shower circled Ravana, the brother of Kubera."
Aranya Kanda,52,29,Slid from the left foot of Vaidehi her anklet adorned with gems fell down onto the plane of earth like an electric annulus with its sparky sparkles.
Aranya Kanda,52,27,"She that Vaidehi who is so delicate like reddish leaflets of trees made that blackish bodied lord of demons, Ravana, well and truly lambent, herself becoming a golden girdle girded around the elephant like Ravana."
Aranya Kanda,52,30,"She that Vaidehi who is so delicate like reddish leaflets of trees made that blackish bodied lord of demons, Ravana, well and truly lambent, as with an elephant, with a golden girdle, stabled in an elephant-stable by a mahout, the elephant-trainer."
Aranya Kanda,52,31,"Ravana, the brother of Kubera, on invading the sky abducted that radiant Seetha who is radiating the sky by her own radiancy like a massive meteor."
Aranya Kanda,52,32,"Some of her ornaments which are lustrously flamy, for they are sparkling like the sparkles of fireworks, are strewn about on the plane of earth with much clatter like the stars pelted down from the sky."
Aranya Kanda,52,33,"A multi-string pearl pendant, a riviï¿½re, that vies with the moonshine has glissaded from the medial of her breasts, and while glissading from sky it is sheeny like River Ganga while she glissaded from skies."
Aranya Kanda,52,34,"The trees on which diverse birds are perching have been stirred up with the wind blown and up-heaved by the gust of Ravana's flight, while the swaying motion of those treetops is as though waving hands to console Seetha saying, ""fear not... fear not..."""
Aranya Kanda,52,33,With wilted lotuses and scared fishes and other beings moving in water the lotus lakes are unenthusiastically sorrowing for Maithili as though Seetha is their girlfriend.
Aranya Kanda,52,35,"The lakes with lotuses as their faces, and fishes as their eyes, and with the other facial adornments like the swimming, sweeping and sailing water-moving beings like tortoises, waterfowls and the like are unenthused, for a similar girlfriend of theirs, the lotus-faced, fish-eyed, lotus-modelled Seetha is beleaguered, and thus they are sorrowing for such a selfsame Maithili."
Aranya Kanda,52,36,"All lions, tigers, animals and birds have then gathered in herds from all-over and ran rancorously and pursuantly shadowing the shadow of Seetha."
Aranya Kanda,52,37,"The mountains appeared bewailing with their waterfalls as shedding tears and with their peaks as upraised arms, while Seetha is thus being abducted."
Aranya Kanda,52,38,"On seeing Vaidehi who is being abducted thus, magnificent Sun in firmament is saddened, and lowly weakened is his sunshine, palely whitened is his sun-disc, and faintly deadened is his solar constant."
Aranya Kanda,52,38,"""When Ravana is abducting none other than the wife of Rama, then there is no probity. At such a juncture, how conscience can prevail? Unfounded are candour and compassion,"" thus the throngs of all beings overly regretted. [3-52-39, 40a]"
Aranya Kanda,52,39,"Verily frightened are the fawns of deer, and their saddened faces are with tear shedding eyes with flustered looks, and they looked up and up at Seetha in sky and wept. [3-52-40b, 41a]"
Aranya Kanda,52,40,"On seeing Seetha who is undergoing anguish in that way the sylvan deities physically shuddered in a worst way. [3-52-41b, 42a]"
Aranya Kanda,52,41,"She who is looking searchingly at the plane of earth for Rama or Lakshmana, and truly bawling in high-pitched but mellowly voice calling ""Rama, Lakshmana"", and whose hair-lengths are tousled, and whose felicitous vermilion mark on her forehead is smudged very untidily, that Decahedral demon abducted such an uncompromising husband-devout, Vaidehi, only for his self-ruination. [3-52-42a, 43]"
Aranya Kanda,52,44,"She who is already detracted from her kinsfolk in Mithila or in Ayodhya, that Maithili with pretty teeth and clean-cut smile is then distanced from the only two last kinsmen, for either Raghava or Lakshmana or both are unseen by her, and thus her face is paled for she is chastened by the cumber of consternation."
Aranya Kanda,53,1,"Maithili, the daughter of Janaka, on seeing the skyward flight of Ravana taking her along became highly frantic and remaining in highest dismay she is distraught."
Aranya Kanda,53,2,"Seetha whose eyes turned coppery-red with tears and resentment, still outpouring tears while being abducted she piteously poured this scorn on that gory-eyed demon's chief, Ravana."
Aranya Kanda,53,3,"""You knave Ravana, you are taking flight on thieving me after prowling about my loneliness, such as you are, are you not ashamed in the least for this subterfuge."
Aranya Kanda,53,4,"""You black-hearted fiend, for sure, you alone sidelined my husband in a trickish guise of Golden Deer wishful to abduct me as you are a coward."
Aranya Kanda,53,5,"""Which king of eagles battled against you to bail me out, an old friend of my father-in-law, such as he is he is also felled, indeed."
Aranya Kanda,53,6,"""Ah, truly what an audacious audacity is shown by you... you basely demon... by ear-shattering your great name saying that 'I am Ravana...' I am conquered in a combat - Really?"
Aranya Kanda,53,7,"""Am I conquered by you in a combat between my husband and you, wherein you on announcing your name to my husband and truly showing your audacious audacity defeated my husband, and thus triumphing over me - or what? Tell me, you mousy demon..."
Aranya Kanda,53,6,"""Unable to conquer my husband in a combat, but able to earbash your name to a lonely woman and abducting her, will this tantamount to your apparently audacious audacity? Thus, I am not really triumphed over by a lowly demon like you..."
Aranya Kanda,53,7,"""A woman, that too a lonely one, that too the other man's wife, that too an abduction, but not winning or wooing her... you knave, on your undertaking such a kind of deplorable deed, how unashamed are you?"
Aranya Kanda,53,8,"""A self-glorifier as you are, this highly inhuman, iniquitous, imputable deed of yours will be recounted by all men in all worlds."
Aranya Kanda,53,9,"""Damn with what you have said then about your might and mettle... damn with this kind of your demeanour which is lamentable to whole of your clan in this world."
Aranya Kanda,53,10,"""What can be done possibly... why because you are fleeing very speedily in this way... wait for a moment to ascertain whether you can go back in aliveness..."
Aranya Kanda,53,11,"""On your coming into the line of sight of those two princes, even if you are with whole of your military, you will be incapacitated to live on, indeed even for a moment..."
Aranya Kanda,53,12,"""Anywise it will be incapable of you to endure the touch of their arrows, as with a bird that cannot endure the overly flaring up wildfire in a forest."
Aranya Kanda,53,15,"""Oh, Ravana, positively contemplate in your soul and politely release me... and if you do not release me, indeed by the rancour of insulting me, my husband along with his brother devises your doom... [3-53-13, 14a]"
Aranya Kanda,53,16,"""You rogue! By which endeavour you are desirous of thieving me under duress, that endeavour of yours behoves absurd. [3-53-14b, 15a]"
Aranya Kanda,53,15,"""Though I am in aliveness now, but on my going under the control of an enemy and on unseeing godlike husband of mine I am indeed unenthused to bear up my lives for a long."
Aranya Kanda,53,18,"""Definitely and completely unanticipated in your heart are either that which is worthwhile or that which is beneficial to you, as mortals undertake a quirkily behaviour at the time of their death..."
Aranya Kanda,53,19,"""At the time of their death mortals wish to enjoy noxious and non-recuperative foods, thus definitely and completely unanticipated in your heart are either nontoxic or beneficial nourishments for your well-being. [3-53-16b, 17a]"
Aranya Kanda,53,20,"""But which is recuperative that is unpalatable to all of the death-rattlers, and indeed, I behold you as one around whose throat the noose of Time is looped. [3-53-17b, 18a]"
Aranya Kanda,53,21,"""As you are dauntless in this daunting situation as for yourself, oh, Decahedral demon, indeed it is clear that you are clearly fantasising the ill-omened golden trees all around. [3-53-18b, 19a]"
Aranya Kanda,53,22,"""Oh, Ravana, you will see the ghastly River Vaitarani which will be tumultuously streaming with blood streams, also thus you will see the grisly sword-leaved-forests in hell. [3-53-19b, 20a]"
Aranya Kanda,53,23,"""You will see silk-cotton trees flowered with molten gold, shrouded with lapis gemlike melting leaves, and enshrouded with sharp irony thorns in hell. [3-53-20b, 21a]"
Aranya Kanda,53,24,"""Oh, unmerciful one, on doing this kind of misdeed to that noble-souled Rama you are incapable to bear up life for a long time like the one who quaffed venom. [3-53-21b, 22a]"
Aranya Kanda,53,25,"""You are bound by the unpreventable lasso of the Time, oh, Ravana, on going where you will get complacency from that uncompromising husband of mine? [3-53-22b, 23a]"
Aranya Kanda,53,26,"""By whom fourteen thousand demons are killed in war just within a minute, single-handedly without any help from his brother, how then that brave and mighty Raghava, an expert in all kinds of missiles, will not eliminate you, the stealer of his chosen wife, with his mordant arrows?"" Thus Seetha poured forth her ire at Ravana. [3-53-23b, 24, 25a]"
Aranya Kanda,53,27,"On saying this much and other exacting words, Vaidehi who has gone onto the flank of Ravana, indeed lamented lamentably as her dismay is coalesced with her distress. [3-53-25b, c]"
Aranya Kanda,53,26,"She who is highly agonised and weeping before talking, a ranter who ranted much, a resentful lady who has come of age, and a pitiable whirler in the hands of demon whose whirligig has transformed into spasmodic jerking of her body for deliverance from that sinner, and in that way that sinner stole that princess Seetha."
Aranya Kanda,54,1,"Vaidehi has not seen any rescuer while she is abducted, but she has seen five prominent vanara-s staying on a mountaintop."
Aranya Kanda,54,2,"That broad-eyed and curvaceous lady with resentment Seetha, inwrapping her auspicious ornaments in the upper-fringe of her sari, dropped in the midmost of those five Vanara-s with a thinking that 'these creatures may perhaps indicate them to Rama.' [3-54-2, 3a]"
Aranya Kanda,54,3,"On his part that Decahedron Ravana has not noticed her action in whipping up her silky upper-cloth and ornaments, their bundling and stowing away at five vanara-s, owing to his own hurry."
Aranya Kanda,54,4,"Those ochreish-eyed best Vanara-s with their unwinking eyes have observed the broad-eyed Seetha, who at that time is verily wailing. [3-54-4b, 5a]"
Aranya Kanda,54,5,"The chief of demons Ravana captivating Maithili, who is still wailing, has crossed the Pampa region down underneath and advanced facing the City of Lanka. [3-54-5b, 6a]"
Aranya Kanda,54,6,"Ravana is jubilantly happy in stealing his own death alias Seetha, as one would carry a stingingly fanged and lethally venomous she-snake in his own lap. [3-54-6b, 7a]"
Aranya Kanda,54,7,"He bolted out in skyway up above the woodlands, waterways, pools, and mountains at the double, as with an arrow bolting from a bow. [3-4-7b, 8a]"
Aranya Kanda,54,8,"On reaching the ocean, a housing for sharks, alligators, a home of Rain-god, a never-draining deep and an ultimate course of the rivers, he hastily crossed it over. [3-54-8b, 9a]"
Aranya Kanda,54,9,"That ocean being the abode of Rain-god is highly flustered when Vaidehi is being abducted over it, and its waves became topsy-turvy and its fishes and great marine-reptiles remained shilly-shally. [3-54-9b, 10a]"
Aranya Kanda,54,10,"Then the siddha-s and caarana-s available in airspace averred saying, ""this alone is the end of Decahedron Ravana."" [3-54-10b, 11a]"
Aranya Kanda,54,11,"Ravana entered the city of Lanka transporting Seetha, while she wriggling in his flank, who appeared like the personified death of Ravana wriggling its way into his Lanka. [3-54-11b, 12a]"
Aranya Kanda,54,12,"On going towards the city Lanka that has well-symmetrized roadways, then he entered his own palace-chambers which is with very many doors and chambers thronging with crowds."
Aranya Kanda,54,13,"On going towards the city Lanka that has well-symmetrized roadways, he then entered his own palace chambers in which royal servants are thronging at many doorways as that palace has very many chambers. [3-54-12b, 13a]"
Aranya Kanda,54,14,"Ravana placed down Seetha whose eyelashes are blackish and who is deep in bewilderment caused by whimpering, therein his palace chambers, as demon Maya once kept his lady-love, a nymphet called Hema, in a demonic Black Hole."
Aranya Kanda,54,15,"Ravana placed down Seetha whose eyelashes are blackish and who is deep in bewilderment caused by whimpering, therein his palace chambers, as demon Maya kept his demonic power in a Black Hole."
Aranya Kanda,54,16,"Ravana placed down Seetha whose eyelashes are blackish and who is deep in bewilderment caused by whimpering, therein his palace chambers, as demon Maya had once kept al his demonic scriptures duly usurping them from his own mentor, namely Shukracaarya, at an unknown illusory place. [3-54-13b, 14a]"
Aranya Kanda,54,17,"That Decahedron Ravana also instructed the bogey-sightly bogeywomen, ""your watch and ward shall be in such a way that neither a female nor a male can see Seetha impermissibly."" [3-54-14b, 15a]"
Aranya Kanda,54,18,"""Whatever she wishes to have, gold, jewels, pearls, apparels or adornments, they all be given to her as you would give me according to my whimsies. [3-54-15b, 16a]"
Aranya Kanda,54,19,"""Whosoever speaks unpleasant words to Vaidehi in the least, either unknowingly or knowingly, her life becomes unpleasant for herself."" Thus Ravana ordered the chamber-demonesses. [3-54-16b, 17a]"
Aranya Kanda,54,20,"On speaking to those demonesses thus that chief of demons exited from that palace chamber, and giving a thought to what is to be done in sequel, then he gave audience to eight highly vigorous demons, the feasters on raw-flesh. [3-54-17b, 18]"
Aranya Kanda,54,19,"He who is egocentric by the boon awarded by Brahma for his invincibleness, that Ravana on giving an audience to those eight demons spoke this sentence to them praiseful of their might and valour."
Aranya Kanda,54,20,"""You immediately take up multiple assaultive weaponry and begone from here to Janasthaana speedily, a place now deadpanned for demons, which earlier was the placement of Khara."
Aranya Kanda,54,21,"""Throwaway your fright faraway and you stay in that Janasthaana which fell void as the demons are voided by someone called Rama, and there you shall stay self-assuredly and self-confidently."
Aranya Kanda,54,22,"""Though highly forceful forces are deployed in Janasthaana, Rama's arrows have utterly destroyed them, together with Khara and Duushana."
Aranya Kanda,54,23,"""Thereby an unprecedented fury is escalating over and above my courage, and an unhindered and unforgivable animosity towards that Rama is evoked in me."
Aranya Kanda,54,24,"""I wish to cast out my begrudging against my enemy who bears a grudge against me, and indeed, to me 'sleep' is not the word for it, until my enemy is undone in a war."
Aranya Kanda,54,25,"""I for myself will be comfortable only on eliminating him who has eliminated Khara and Duushana as with a pauper acquiring riches."
Aranya Kanda,54,26,"""While you remain in Janasthaana you have to accurately bring me the information about Rama's activities and deportment."
Aranya Kanda,54,27,"""Do not go heedlessly, you all night-walkers, for that Rama appears to be too dangerous, and on your going there heedfully, you have to continually try for the elimination of that Raghava."
Aranya Kanda,54,28,"""I am aware of your might in battle fronts for a number of times, as such I have commissioned you all in that Janasthaana."" Thus Ravana spoke to those eight demons."
Aranya Kanda,54,29,"Then on picking up those words amiable to all intents and purposes of Ravana, those eight demons departed from Lanka on hailing Ravana, and they collectively journeyed in the direction of Janasthaana with their imperceivable appearances."
Aranya Kanda,54,30,"Ravana is then highly gladdened well and truly on gaining over Seetha, and even for holding sway over that Maithili, and equally for the well-wrought and archly animosity with Rama, whereby that demon Ravana is hypocritically amused."
Aranya Kanda,55,1,On directing those eight ghastly demons Ravana is amused in his heart of hearts that he has accomplished a great feat.
Aranya Kanda,55,2,"On continually musing upon Vaidehi Ravana is tormented with the arrows of Love-god, thereby to lay eyes on Seetha he post-hastily entered the beautiful palace."
Aranya Kanda,55,3,On entering the palace-chamber that supremo of demons beheld Seetha overwhelmed with ruefulness amongst demonesses.
Aranya Kanda,55,4,"She whose visage is brimming over with tears, one browbeaten and downtrodden with the burden of bewail, one capsized like a boat that is about to capsize in an ocean spreadeagled with whirlwinds, and one alike an impala altogether swerved from its herd of impala yet hemmed in with dog-wolves, that nightwalker came nigh of such a Seetha whose face is downcast unwilling to see any, and to such a pitiable Seetha who is in the shackles of her sorrow, that supremo of demons compellingly started to show his palace which is similar to any paradisiacal palace. [3-55-4, 5, 6]"
Aranya Kanda,55,5,"That paradisiacal mansion house of Decahedral Ravana is congestive with innumerable cupolaed skyscrapers, adored with thousands of females, frequented by diverse bevies of birds, and it comprised of numerous gemstones. The pillars are amazingly gilded with engraving of ivory, gilt, quartz, silvern linocuts, and they are even embossed with diamonds and with lapis gems, which are heart-pleasing for a look. The drumbeats of divine drums are echoing in entire palace, and its archways are adorned with the gildings of pure gold. [3-55-7, 8, 9a]"
Aranya Kanda,55,6,"Ravana walked up the wonderful golden staircase along with Seetha, and the rows of skyscrapers with windows that are ivoried and silvered and with window-blinds are seen from the windows of the landing on that flight of stairs, which are also ivoried and silvered windows with window-blinds, and all are amusing for sight. [3-55-9b, 10]"
Aranya Kanda,55,11,That Decahedral Ravana displayed the multiple stories of his own palace which is all over white-marbled and diamond encrusted to Maithili.
Aranya Kanda,55,12,"Ravana continued to display the descendible wellsprings and leisure pools from which diverse flowers have sprung and overspread them, regardless of Seetha's languishing under her anguish."
Aranya Kanda,55,13,"On flaunting his best palace in its entirety to Vaidehi that dirty-minded Ravana spoke this sentence to Seetha in order that she may be tempted on her own, lustily."
Aranya Kanda,55,10,"""Oh, Seetha, ten crores of first-rated demons are there, furthermore, twenty-two crores of demons of ghastly exploits are there, thus all put together, three hundred twenty millions of demons are there in Lanka, omitting the weakish, oldish, youngish demons. For all of them I am the lord."" Thus Ravana started his self-eulogy. [3-55-14, 15a]"
Aranya Kanda,55,11,"""For every single work of mine a thousand servitors will rush in. Such as I am I pledge entire life of mine along with the suzerainty of this sovereign city-state Lanka to you, oh, broad-eyed lady, for you are loftier than my lives. [3-55-15b, 16]"
Aranya Kanda,55,17,"""Oh, Seetha, you will become an empress for all of the those countless females of finest fabric amassed by me, oh, dear, if only you marry me."
Aranya Kanda,55,18,"""You be keen on my amiable words and it will be apt of you to show compassion on me, for I have burning desire for you, and of what use is your thinking conversely about that long-lost Rama?"
Aranya Kanda,55,19,"""It is impossible to assail this Lanka even for Indra with all of the gods and demons, as an ocean roundly enshrouds this Lanka which is hundred-yojana-s witdthwise."
Aranya Kanda,55,20,"""I behold none matchable to my vitality is existent among gods; among yaksha-s - no; among gandharva-s - no; among sages - no, nor anyone in any world."
Aranya Kanda,55,21,"""What can you achieve with that dethroned, hapless, seer, vagrant Rama who is short-lived, for after all, he is a human with littlest vitality?"
Aranya Kanda,55,22,"""Oh, Seetha, you apotheosise me only for I am your seemliest husband, oh, jumpy lady, indeed, primeness has impermanence, thus here you be blithesome with me."
Aranya Kanda,55,23,"""Oh, beautifully visaged lady, it is needless to have half a mind to see that Raghava, oh, Seetha, even if his wits chariot him what is his calibre to come thither crossing an un-crossable ocean?"
Aranya Kanda,55,24,"""It is impossible to knot the currents of cyclonic gusts in mid air, more so, it is impracticable to lay hold on the tongues of radiately irradiant fire."
Aranya Kanda,55,25,"""Oh, benefactress of bliss, he who can lead you back with his valour, while you are being fended off by my mighty arms, him I do not envisage even in any one world of this threefold world."
Aranya Kanda,55,26,"""You rule over this very great empire of Lanka as an empress of Lanka, while me and mine, also thus all gods like me who hitherto are under my rule, and all mobile and sessile entities of whom I am the ruler, they too will hereafter make ourselves useful as your royal stewards, if you marry me."
Aranya Kanda,55,22,"""Wet with the waters of anointment you be elated and then delight me. By your damnable dwelling in forests bygone is your bad-luck that you misdealt in bygone times. And what dutiable good deed is to be done by you in marrying me, you do that now, and secure the fruits of that good deed here by marrying me. [3-55-27, 28a]"
Aranya Kanda,55,23,"""Oh, Maithili, here all the garlands are divinely fragranced and the jewellery is topmost, you will dress up with them along with me should you become my wife. [3-55-28b]"
Aranya Kanda,55,24,"""Oh, well-waisted lady, just by my might I notched up an aircraft known as Pushpaka from my brother Kubera in a war with him, which is similar sun in its shine. [3-55-29b. 30a]"
Aranya Kanda,55,25,"""That aircraft is expansive and exhilarating, also its speed is on par with intuition, oh, Seetha, in that you can cheerfully fly about along with me, should you marry me. [3-55-30b, 31a]"
Aranya Kanda,55,26,"""Oh, lady with a comely countenance, your visage is lotus similar in its shine, besides being immaculate, fairish and eyeful, but oh, curvaceous lady, with such a mushily maudlin of such a face this palace of mine is unbright, thus marry me to brighten everything"" Thus Ravana spoke to Seetha.

Aranya Kanda,55,27,"While Ravana is speaking to her in this way that graceful lady Seetha veiled her moonier face with fringe of her sari, and stiflingly dispelled tears on that mooniest face behind her half-veil. [3-55-32b, 33a]"
Aranya Kanda,55,28,"To her who is disconcerted and whose anguish marred her brilliance and who is appearing as though pondering over the question of her submittal to Ravana, or otherwise, although she is meditating, to such a Seetha Ravana the nightwalker said these words. [3-55-33b, 34a]"
Aranya Kanda,55,29,"""Oh, Vaidehi, enough is this embarrassment of yours presuming that your consorting with me is detrimental to scriptural canons, oh, empress, what that is approaching you in the form of queen-hood is absolutely compatible with the tradition."
Aranya Kanda,55,30,"""Oh, Vaidehi, enough is this embarrassment of yours presuming that your consorting with me is detrimental to scriptural canons, what that is approaching you in the mode of queen-hood is ordained by gods and it is absolutely traditional. [3-55-34b, 35a]"
Aranya Kanda,55,31,"""Let these two feet of yours be massaged by my ten heads, do me favour readily, for I am your subordinate and servant. [3-55-35b. 36a]"
Aranya Kanda,55,32,"""I with a lustful hollow-heart spoke all these hollow words that are unbefitting to my stature, indeed, Ravana will never supplicate headlong to whosoever woman. [3-55-36b, 36c]"
Aranya Kanda,55,37,"That Decahedral Ravana on speaking thus to Maithili, who is the daughter of Janaka, deemed that 'she is mine,' as he has gone under the sway of the Terminator."
Aranya Kanda,56,1,"She that Vaidehi who is haggard by anguish boldly spoke to Ravana when he addressed her in that way, duly placing a blade of straw in between herself and Ravana."
Aranya Kanda,56,2,"""He whose son is Raghava, is a resolute king known as Dasharatha. That king is a kingly rampart for righteousness, a kingpin abiding in forthrightness and thereby his kingliness is well renowned in all worlds, and my husband Rama is such a king's son."
Aranya Kanda,56,3,"""Such a Dasharatha's son who is virtue-souled one, who is highly renowned in all the three worlds for his ambidexterity and perspicacity, and who is known as Rama is my husband and a god to me."
Aranya Kanda,56,4,"""He who took birth in Ikshvaku's dynasty is a great-resplendent one with his shoulders like those of a lion, and who comes here along with similarly lion-shouldered and nearly great-resplendent brother of his, namely Lakshmana, to take your lives away. Such Rama is my husband."
Aranya Kanda,56,5,"""Had I been forcibly humiliated by you in the presence of Rama, you too would have been killed by Rama in combat and by now you too would be sprawling on earth, as with Khara in Janasthaana, but you foxed him. However, such Rama is my husband."
Aranya Kanda,56,6,"""Those demons who are spoken of you to be with ghastly forms and gruelling power, they all will become formless and powerless in face of Raghava, as with all snakes becoming non-poisonous earthworms in the face of Garuda, the Divine Eagle. Such Rama is my husband."
Aranya Kanda,56,7,"""Those gilded arrows of Rama unloosened directly and unswervingly from his bowstring will utterly batter your body, as the waves of River Ganga will be battering that river's riverbanks. Such Rama is my husband."
Aranya Kanda,56,8,"""Even if you are unkillable either by gods or by demons, you Ravana, you will not be disenthralled by Rama while you are alive, for you hatched a very great animosity in him against you."
Aranya Kanda,56,9,"""That mighty Rama will become the terminator of the vestige of your life, and as with an animal fastened to the stake of sacrifice your life too will become irretrievable."
Aranya Kanda,56,10,"""If he that Rama glances you with his rancour-torched eyes, you demon, you will be completely burnt down now itself, as with Love-god burnt down by Furious Shiva."
Aranya Kanda,56,11,"""He that Rama who hurls down the moon from skies onto earth, or else extirpates it if need be, or even desiccates an ocean, he alone rescues Seetha from here."
Aranya Kanda,56,12,"""Gone is your liveability, gone is your prosperity, gone is your vivacity, and gone is your faculty. Thus Lanka is widowed by a single deed of yours."
Aranya Kanda,56,13,"""In forest you have separated me from the propinquity of my husband, which diabolic deed of yours will not result in any ultimate happiness for you."
Aranya Kanda,56,14,"""In fact, that great-resplendent husband of mine, Rama, is still residing in the eremitical Dandaka forest, bravely hinging on to his own valour, in tandem only with my brother-in-law."
Aranya Kanda,56,15,"""With storms of his arrows in a given combat my husband will dislodge arrogance, insolence, puissance, like that impudence from every limb of yours."
Aranya Kanda,56,16,"""As and when ruination of created beings manifests actuated by Time, then all of them will place their behaviour in endangerment, as they have gone under the control of End-Time."
Aranya Kanda,56,17,"""This is that time which has bechanced on you owing to your molesting me, you basely demon, by which time-factor yourself, all of your demons, and even all of your queens in the Chambers of Queens will be devastated."
Aranya Kanda,56,18,"""It is impossible for a profaner to heavily tread on the Altar of Fire amidst a Ritual Hall surrounded by oblational vessels, further sanctified by Vedic hymns."
Aranya Kanda,56,19,"""Likewise, I am the solemnly pledged legitimate wife of one who steadied himself in righteousness, and such as I am, you basely demon, it is impossible for you trespasser to touch me even."
Aranya Kanda,56,20,"""How a she-swan ever frolicking with majestic swans in bunches of lotuses can leer at a water-crow sneaking in a bunch of grass?"
Aranya Kanda,56,21,"""Oh, demon, you may either trammel or vandalise this inertial body of mine. I claim neither this body nor life of mine as my own. But I am intolerant to bear with any disrepute on this earth."" Thus Seetha castigated Ravana. [3-56-21, 22a]"
Aranya Kanda,56,22,"Vaidehi on speaking those highly caustic words angrily to Ravana in this way, she that Maithili spoke no more in that matter. [3-56-22b, 23a]"
Aranya Kanda,56,23,"On hearing Seetha's scathing and hair-raising censures, then Ravana retorted with these intimidatory chides. [3-56-23b, 24a]"
Aranya Kanda,56,24,"""Oh, angry lady Maithili, listen to my words. A period of twelve months is given to you. And oh, smiley smiler, if you do not come nigh of me within that period, then the cooks will slice you to pieces for the purpose of a morning meal."" [3-56-24b, 25]"
Aranya Kanda,56,26,"Thus on saying those harsh words, Ravana, the one who makes his enemies to bewail, and who is now infuriated said this sentence to the guarding demonesses."
Aranya Kanda,56,27,"""Oh, gnarled demonesses of grisly mien and devourers of meat and blood, you have to indeed remove her pride immediately."
Aranya Kanda,56,28,Just by that order of Ravana those demonesses of grotesque and ugly appearance have obediently made palm-fold to him and encircled Maithili.
Aranya Kanda,56,29,That king Ravana paced in an earth-shattering manner as though to cleave it and clearly said this to those demonesses with ghastly look.
Aranya Kanda,56,30,"""Let this Maithili be taken to the centre of Ashoka gardens, where you all shall blockade and guard her stealthily."
Aranya Kanda,56,31,"""You threaten her with dreadful admonitions and again speaking imploringly you all have to bring her under control, as a wild she-elephant of age will be brought under control."
Aranya Kanda,56,31,"When Ravana has clearly ordered, those demonesses on their part took Maithili to Ashoka garden. That Ashoka gardens are surrounded with trees that yield fruits to every savour, and now they are diversely flowered and fruited. Further, those gardens are highly adored by all-time lusty birds. [3-56-32, 33]"
Aranya Kanda,56,34,"But she that Janaka's daughter Maithili whose body is with a coverall of anguish, further on obtaining the control of demonesses, she is as good as a she-deer under the coverall of tigresses."
Aranya Kanda,56,35,"Maithili, the daughter of Janaka, who is already consumed by utmost agony has not obtained any placidity now as with a she-deer bound by tether - where timorousness is common to both."
Aranya Kanda,56,36,"Maithili knows no peace when the bizarre-eyed demonesses have highly intimidated her, and by shut-seeing those demonesses her reminiscences went over to her dear husband and about her brother-in-law Lakshmana too, and when she felt about the improbability of their coming here, she is distraught with alarm and anguish, and then she swooned."
Aranya Kanda,57,1,"Rama on killing that demon Maareecha, who is a guise changer at his wish and who moved about in the guise of a deer, instantly started to return on the trail by which he trailed after that deer-demon."
Aranya Kanda,57,2,"While Rama is anxiously hurrying to see Maithili, then a brutish voiced jackal deafeningly howled at his behind."
Aranya Kanda,57,3,"On hearing that threatening and hair-raising howl of jackal Rama is overly threatened just by the tone of fox in which it is foreboding, inasmuch as the forbidding intoning of Maareecha."
Aranya Kanda,57,4,"""Huh! As to how this jackal has howled I deem that as inauspicious. As yet undevoured by demons would Vaidehi be safe?"
Aranya Kanda,57,5,"""On knowing the nature of my voice Maareecha in the semblance of a deer yelled out mimicking my voice. If Lakshmana listens that voice, recognising it as my voice he will instantly rush to my near. Else if Maithili listens, she will hasten him to go over here and Soumitri instantly rushes here leaving her off. [3-57-5, 6]"
Aranya Kanda,57,6,"""As could be seen from Maareecha's becoming a Golden Deer only to sidetrack and take me away from hermitage, his becoming a demon when hit with an arrow, and his shouting words indeed like, 'ha, Lakshmana, ha, Seetha, I am killed,' the demons are collectively intending to do away with Seetha. It is certain. [3-57-7, 8]"
Aranya Kanda,57,7,"""Whether there will be safety in forest for those two in my absence, or not, is my doubt. Owing to my devastating Janasthaana I have become a harboured grudge for demons, am not I! As such, foretokens are appearing now, severely and severally."" Thus Rama's thoughts have sprinted. [3-57-9, 10a]"
Aranya Kanda,57,8,"When that soulful Rama has heard the whistle of jackal while returning, he persistently thought in this way about his detour caused by demon in the disguise of a deer, thus he speedily advanced towards his hermitage. [3-57-10b, 11]"
Aranya Kanda,57,12,"Raghava came to Janasthaana doubting overly, and the animals and birds of Janasthaana which look doleful have neared him whose heart has become doleful."
Aranya Kanda,57,13,"Those doleful animals and birds moving in circumambulations from the left side to right of that noble-souled Rama they let off frightening shrieks, and then observing those highly forbidding foretokens Rama returned to his own hermitage hastily and hurriedly."
Aranya Kanda,57,11,"Then Rama saw Lakshmana coming towards him with a lacklustre face, and then Lakshmana, who is melancholic and anguishing in his divergence from Seetha, met Rama not a long-way-off, where Rama is a similar partaker in melancholy and anguishing by way of his convergence upon ill-omens. [3-57-14, 15a]"
Aranya Kanda,57,12,"On seeing Lakshmana who has arrived at this place leaving off Seetha in a forest that is desolate, more so an adorable forest for demons, Rama reproached him as his elder brother. [3-57-15b, 16a]"
Aranya Kanda,57,13,"Taking Lakshmana's left hand into his, Rama, the descendent of Raghu, alike a bewailer spoke this brusque speech that has a mellowly fruition in future. [3-57-16b, 17a]"
Aranya Kanda,57,14,"""You have done a deplorable deed in coming here forsaking Seetha. Now, oh, gentle Lakshmana, are we somewhat safe, or everything has already gone astray now itself, or what. [3-57-17b, 18a]"
Aranya Kanda,57,15,"""Oh, brave one, according to these many inauspicious forebodings that have manifested themselves to me, we might have lost Janaka's daughter Seetha, or the forest ranging demons might have devoured her, or else they might have kidnapped her, I am doubtless about it. [3-57-18b, 19]"
Aranya Kanda,57,20,"""Oh, tigerly-man Lakshmana, I wonder whether we can at least make out the daughter of Janaka Seetha in her intactness and aliveness."
Aranya Kanda,57,21,"""On observing these mobs of deer, this jackal, also even these birds which are voicing noisily facing the direction lit by the sun, oh, great-mighty Lakshmana, can we presume that there will be safety to that princes Seetha?"
Aranya Kanda,57,22,"""This very demon in his likeness to a deer led me on and led me off distantly as I was indeed following him, and by an intense effort somehow he was killed, and when dying he transfigured into a demon."
Aranya Kanda,57,23,"""Now even my heart is woeful and I am woebegone, my left eye is also fluttering erratically, oh, Lakshmana, no doubt Seetha is not there in hermitage, maybe she is whisked away, or, wiped out, or, wandering around on a wrong way."
Aranya Kanda,58,1,"On seeing dreary Lakshmana coming into the void of forest devoid of Vaidehi, then the virtue-souled Rama, the son of Dasharatha, has asked him impatiently."
Aranya Kanda,58,2,"""She who has come in tow with me to Dandaka forest when I started for peregrination, whom you have now deserted and came here, oh, Lakshmana, she that Vaidehi, where is she?"
Aranya Kanda,58,3,"""When I have become forlorn with the forfeiture of my kingdom and when I was rushing for Dandaka forest she stood with me as a partaker in my woes. She that comely Vaidehi, where is she?"
Aranya Kanda,58,4,"""Without whom I am disinclined to live even for a moment, oh, valiant one, such a Seetha who in simile is like the daughter of deities and who is my life-force, where is she?"
Aranya Kanda,58,5,"""I am unambitious for the rulership either on heavens or on the earth, oh, Lakshmana, without the daughter of Janaka whose aspect glisters like gold."
Aranya Kanda,58,6,"""Vaidehi who is dearer to me than my lives, will she be alive somehow! Oh, valiant Lakshmana, this peregrination of mine, will it not become futile, someway!"
Aranya Kanda,58,7,"""When I am dead for the sake of Seetha and when you get back to Ayodhya lonesomely, and when Kaikeyi's wishes are accomplished thus, oh, Soumitri, will she be comfortable, somewhat!"
Aranya Kanda,58,8,"""Kaikeyi is with her son, with a kingdom, and further her 'purposes are achieved,' oh, gentle Lakshmana, and because of the death of her son will my austerely mother Kausalya humbly get into the servitude of Kaikeyi, anyhow!"
Aranya Kanda,58,9,"""I wish to get at the hermitage again if only that Vaidehi of good-conduct is alive in hermitage, else, oh, Lakshmana, if death has already conducted her out of hermitage I too will give up my lives here itself."
Aranya Kanda,58,10,"""If Seetha, the princess from Videha, does not chat with me as before smiling gleefully on my arrival at the hermitage, oh, Lakshmana, I really breath my last."
Aranya Kanda,58,11,"""Say Lakshmana, whether that pietistic Vaidehi is alive or not? Or, on your becoming unmindful of your guard is she consumed by demons, either?"
Aranya Kanda,58,12,"""She who is softish by her nature and youngish by her age has never noticed the despair of separation from me, and now by my dissociation she will be despairing brokenheartedly, so it seems."
Aranya Kanda,58,13,"""That impostor and highly impudent demon Maareecha who shouted loudly as, 'oh, Lakshmana,' might have caused fear even in you in everyway."
Aranya Kanda,58,14,"""I hope that Vaidehi has also heard that voice which is similar to that of mine, and I hope frightened as she is she might have also hastened you, and I hope you also have come to see me, that hastily!"
Aranya Kanda,58,15,"""In everyway you have caused hardship by leaving Seetha in isolation, and a leeway is given to the diabolical demons for a counterattack against us."
Aranya Kanda,58,16,"""Raw-flesh eating demons are distraught as I have liquidated Khara, as a result those ghastly ones would have liquidated Seetha by now. There is no doubt about it."
Aranya Kanda,58,17,"""In everyway I am sunken in scourge, but oh, enemy-eliminator Lakshmana, what I can possibly do in present situation? Perchance, this sort of scourge is liable to chance upon me, alas!"" Thus Rama gave vent to his feelings on his way to hermitage."
Aranya Kanda,58,18,"In this way while thinking emotively about that curvaceous Seetha, Raghava hurriedly returned to Janasthaana along with Lakshmana."
Aranya Kanda,58,19,"He that Rama who chastened his younger brother en route is worried in aspect and wizened is his mouth by hunger, by strain, and also thus by thirst, and suspiring heavily he arrived near at hermitage, and became dispirited when he beheld the hermitage in vacuity. That valiant Rama on quickly entering his own hermitage found it to be vacuous. Then he rushed out and went round a place of pastime of Seetha, saying 'yes, this is that place where she used to move round for plucking flowers.' And again he dashed in to hermitage only to find it as an empty cottage. Then he rushed out to some other place of playtime of Seetha yelling, 'yes, this is that place where she used play with deer, squirrels and birds.' And again came back to vacant hermitage, and again he dashed to some other prayer-time place exclaiming, 'yes, this is that very place where she offered her daily prayers.' Finally on returning to the vacant hermitage he became one who is plunged into hair-raising throes of despair as that cottage is emptied of Seetha. [3-58-19, 20]"
Aranya Kanda,59,1,"The content of this chapter is to amplify what that has been said in the previous chapter. This dialogue between Rama and Lakshmana may be deemed to have happened before their approaching hermitage, as in the last few verses of last chapter, and on their pathway to their hermitage."
Aranya Kanda,59,1,"Rama the descendent of Raghu, again asked Soumitri who strayed from the hermitage and whom his own anguish is distressing now, in the middle of path towards their hermitage."
Aranya Kanda,59,2,"Rama spoke to such Lakshmana, ""when I left her in the forest, I left only on confiding in you. For what reason you came to me on abandoning Maithili?"
Aranya Kanda,59,3,"""What my heart had been doubting, rather a perilous evil, oh, Lakshmana, that has become a fact on seeing only you, coming to me leaving off Maithili."
Aranya Kanda,59,4,"""Seeing your coming without Seetha on pathway at a distance my left eye and left shoulder have pulsated, and oh, Lakshmana, my heart too has fluttered."" Thus Rama said to Lakshmana."
Aranya Kanda,59,5,"When Sumitra's son Lakshmana, whose traits are blamelessly auspicious is addressed thus, anguish cast a double spell on him, one for the tongue-lashing of Seetha while the other for the reproach from Rama, and he replied Rama who is anguished in his own way."
Aranya Kanda,59,6,"""I have not come here leaving her off either independently or intentionally, I came here, to your proximity, virtually driven by her hurtful words."" Thus Lakshmana is relying Rama."
Aranya Kanda,59,7,"""Maithili gave an ear to that message which is loudly shouted as if by your honour saying, 'ha, Seetha... ha, Lakshmana... save me immediately...'"
Aranya Kanda,59,8,"""On hearing that grievous voice of yours and owing to her love for you she shuddered with fear and wept out to me 'hurry up...get going...'"
Aranya Kanda,59,9,"""When she frequently and insistingly compelled me to go, I have replied Maithili in this sentence which is expressive of my confidence in you."
Aranya Kanda,59,10,""" 'I do no think that there is a demon who can cause panic to Rama. All this is feigning. Someone might have typified his voice in this way, please control yourself."
Aranya Kanda,59,11,""" 'How can my esteemed brother who can safeguard even gods, oh, Seetha, will exclaim in saying, 'save me,' which is a highly disparaging and basely manner to call for the help of a lady to safeguard him in such circumstances."
Aranya Kanda,59,12,""" 'But, somehow, for some reason, someone mimicking my brother's voice discordantly shouted words saying, 'Lakshmana save me.'"
Aranya Kanda,59,13,""" 'Oh, auspicious lady, it is unbefitting for you to panic, like lowly womenfolk who will be frivolously panicking for flimsy reasons, for the words like 'save me,' shouted by some demon, who may conceivably be Maareecha."
Aranya Kanda,59,15,""" 'Enough is your slipping into consternation and you be undismayed. There is none in all the three worlds who took birth, or going to take birth, to defeat Raghava in any given battle of any terrible nature. Raghava is undefeatable even if all gods come battling along with Indra in their van.' This is what I said to Vaidehi"" Thus Lakshmana is informing Rama. [3-59-14, 15]"
Aranya Kanda,59,16,"""Though I said thus, while her volition is overly besotted for you, Vaidehi said this tartly word to me outpouring tears."
Aranya Kanda,59,17,""" 'In my respect you have harboured only an impure and nastily perspective to achieve me on the utter ruination of your brother, but I am unachievable to you."
Aranya Kanda,59,18,""" 'As to why you are refraining to rush towards Rama even though he is inordinately yelling, it hints that Bharata made some arrangements with you, and that is the reason why you have closely followed Rama in exile."
Aranya Kanda,59,19,""" 'You are an adversary of Rama comporting yourself in disguise, following him because of me, and searching for a leeway from Rama. Thereby now you are not rushing to Rama."
Aranya Kanda,59,20,"""When Vaidehi spoke to me thus I hurriedly came out of hermitage to you with anger reddening my eyes and trembling my lips."
Aranya Kanda,59,21,"Rama who is deluded by angst said to Soumitri who is speaking thus, that ""your arrival without her is an improper deed, oh, gentle one."
Aranya Kanda,59,22,"""You know that I am capable enough to foil the demons, even then you have come out by the angry words of Maithili?"
Aranya Kanda,59,23,"""On hearing bitter words of an angry lady you have came away on leaving her off, such as you are, I am not at all happy with you."
Aranya Kanda,59,24,"""That which action of yours is there in non-compliance of my directive to stand guard to Seetha, either compelled by Seetha, or coming under your own ire, it shows your dereliction in everyway."
Aranya Kanda,59,25,"""By whom I am detoured from hermitage in the form of a deer he is indeed a demon, and he fell flat when my arrow hit him down."
Aranya Kanda,59,26,"""When I effortlessly shot an arrow setting on bowstring and stretching the bow to full length, he hit by that arrow left deer's body to become a piteously bewailing demon wearing bracelets and the like ornaments."
Aranya Kanda,59,27,"""Then hit down by arrow thus, he with an anguished voice that is clearly audible at a very remotely place and that which is mimicking my voice, uttered those highly gruesome words, whereby you have come here forsaking Maithili."" Thus Rama said to Lakshmana on their way to their hermitage."
Aranya Kanda,60,1,"While Rama is coming towards hermitage his lower eyelid frequently fluttered, his gait faltered, and he missed his footing."
Aranya Kanda,60,2,"On closely watching those inauspicious forebodings Rama indeed uttered oftentimes reflexly thus as, 'would she be safe, in fact!'"
Aranya Kanda,60,3,"He quickened himself and went with an ardency to see Seetha, and then on seeing an empty home his heart is distraught."
Aranya Kanda,60,4,"Raghava looked like a flying-flutterer as his speed jostled his arms and gait flutteringly, and on closely probing there and there, and all-over the places of that cottage, then he saw the lustreless house of straw devoid of Seetha, alike a befogged wintry lotus-lake without lustre. [3-60-4, 5]"
Aranya Kanda,60,5,"The trees of that woodland are seemingly weeping, as their flowers are witheringly weakening and their birds are weepingly warbling, and the animals are whingeingly weeping, and that woodland is charmless and utterly shattered, since its georgic deities have completely abandoned it. Rather utterly bestrewn are the deerskins and sacred grass blades, rather utterly battered are the tender-grass-seats and other mats in the compound of cottage, and he who ardently wanted to see Seetha, such a Rama, on seeing such an emptied locale and cottage, wept over, over and again. [3-60-6, 7]"
Aranya Kanda,60,8,"""That bashful Seetha might be stolen by the grudging demons, or slain by the very same grisly demons, or savoured by some gruesome beasts, or else she strayed in this gauntly forest, and even she might have playfully shrouded herself in the grimly forest, or else she must be sheltering herself in this forest which will be gruelling to locate."
Aranya Kanda,60,9,"""Or else, she might have again gone to pick the flowers or fruits, or again gone to lotus-lake, or gone to the river for water."" Thinking thus, Rama started his search for Seetha."
Aranya Kanda,60,10,"Though he searched effortfully for his dear Seetha he did not get her, and as his anguish is reddening his eyes the appearance of that glorious one seems to be that of a madman."
Aranya Kanda,60,11,"Rama ran speedily from tree to shrub, from hill to hillock, from river to rivulet, and revolving around them he wailed for Seetha, as he is inundated in a sludgy ocean of woes."
Aranya Kanda,60,12,"""Oh, Kadamba tree, seest thou someone a lady who is lover of Kadamba flowers, one with a lovable face and a love of mine, thou tellest me if thou knowest."

Aranya Kanda,60,31,"""Her face which is similar to a full-moon with pretty teeth, prettier lips, prettily nose and with prettyish earrings, might have obtained a blanched look when being devoured..."
Aranya Kanda,60,32,"""But that exquisite and beautiful neck of that lady which shines forth in the colour of Campaka flower, befitting for any neck ornament, indeed it might be glutted down while she is bewailing..."
Aranya Kanda,60,33,"""Her two arms which are delicate like tender leaves, ornamented with bangles and bicep-lets might have been definitely nibbled while they are wriggling with quivering fingers..."
Aranya Kanda,60,34,"""This is as though I have forsaken this youngish Seetha really as a feast for the demons in my absence, and though Seetha has many relatives she has become as worse as a lonesome woman who is completely forsaken by her caravan who is lonesomely ready for the feast of highwaymen, and demons have feasted on her."
Aranya Kanda,60,35,"""Ha, Lakshmana... oh, dextrous one... have you seen my ladylove anywhere... ha, dear, where have you gone... oh, auspicious lady... ha, Seetha..."" thus Rama lamented again and again in his search."
Aranya Kanda,60,34,"On bewailing in this way and on overly rushing from wood to wood, somewhere Rama has become highly delusional by the forcefulness of delusion and spots forest stuff as Seetha, though none of them have any resemblance to Seetha, and somewhere else, marking creepers, plants or slender shrubs and suchlike delicacies as Seetha he has become really alluded by the powerfulness of allusion, and elsewhere, he is not discriminating paths or pathless routes for his trekking as an impassioned one in the search of his ladylove, and thus he is nitid like a madman. [3-60-36, 37a]"
Aranya Kanda,60,37,"Rama is on the rove around woods, rivers, hills, mountain-rapids and thicketed forests, speedily and restlessly."
Aranya Kanda,60,38,"On going round the vast of great forest in that way and on searching for Maithili, his hope became intangible, but again he undertook the search for his ladylove, over-strenuously."
Aranya Kanda,61,1,"From here, until Rama meets Hanuma in next book Kishkindha, Rama's lamentation is continually portrayed. This may not be taken as a mere 'weeping' or 'bemoaning' of the principal character of the epic, but this has many poetics and romantics of epical poetry imbibed in it. An epic, basically, requires a hero to have his romantic attributes, naayaka lakshaNaaH and these 'wailings' will portray all of them. There are various, numerous and voluminous derivatives, meanings and commentaries, which cannot possibly be included in here, at this stage, except for passing references on them. Hence, this lengthy lamentation has lengthier romanticism."
Aranya Kanda,61,2,"On seeing the vacant threshold of the hermitage and empty cottage of straw, also at the leaf-mat-seats that are utterly shattered, and not finding Vaidehi even on watchfully eyeing everywhere Rama shrieked loudly, and then on clasping the winning shoulders of Lakshmana he said this to him. [3-61-1, 2]"
Aranya Kanda,61,3,"""Oh, Lakshmana, possibly where can be Vaidehi? Or, to which place she has gone from here? Or, Soumitri, who stole her away? Or, who has gorged up my ladylove?"
Aranya Kanda,61,4,"""Oh, Seetha, if you have concealed yourself under trees wishing to poke fun at me, enough is your fun and games, get in touch with me now, as I am highly anguished..."
Aranya Kanda,61,5,"""Oh, meek Seetha, with which meekly young deer you were playing, all these are now broody with tearfully fluttery looks, without you..."
Aranya Kanda,61,6,"""Really Lakshmana, I will not live long without Seetha, indeed I am enveloped in high anguish caused by the abduction of Seetha, and this alone will become a murderer, and on my going to other world when murdered by my own agony my father and that great king Dasharatha will definitely observe me in the other world... [3-61-6, 7a]"
Aranya Kanda,61,7,"""When I go to other world after my death our father Dasharatha who is already staying there will deride me saying, 'when I have directed you for a fourteen year exile, and when you too have assuredly agreed and promised me for that term, how you have to my presence in this ultramundane world without completing that term of fourteen year exile, besides breaking your own word of honour... thus you have become a wilful disobedient, despicable and dishonest person, such as you are, fie on you...' [3-61-7b, 8, 9a]"
Aranya Kanda,61,8,"""Anguish seared and bewildered me and I am woebegone with broken down buoyancy, and oh, beautiful lady, jilting such an woeful one as I am, where you are going now, as with prestige jilting a prevaricator? And if you shun me I will have to shun my life..."" Thus Rama bewailed imaging her right in his front and running away. [3-61-9b, 10, 11a]"
Aranya Kanda,61,9,"Though that legatee of Raghu is desperate for seeing Seetha, though he is highly anguished and agonised, though he bewailed this way, that Rama has not found Janaka's daughter, Seetha. [3-61-10b, 11a]"
Aranya Kanda,61,10,"To him who is unable to find Seetha, and who is sinking in sadness as with an elephant sinking in a chasmal mud, Lakshmana spoke to such a Rama in a positive manner desiring his wellbeing. [3-61-11b, 13]"
Aranya Kanda,61,14,"""Oh, well-informed one, do not get into desperation, you make efforts along with me, and oh, brave one, this best mountain is beaming forth with many caves, she may be there somewhere."
Aranya Kanda,61,15,"""Maithili is a fascinated saunterer in woodlands so she might have entered the forest, she is even infatuated with waters, so she might have gone to the fully bloomed lotus-lake, or to the river that is adorned by fishes and cane-breaks."
Aranya Kanda,61,16,"""Or, wishing to know our reaction when she scares us with her prank, Maithili might have squirreled away into forest. Oh, honourable brother, let us endeavour quickly to search her."
Aranya Kanda,61,18,"""Oh, Rama of Kakutstha, if you consider that we shall search the forest in its entirety to locate where she that Janaka's daughter might be, let us quickly do so. But do not engulf your heart in sadness."" Thus Lakshmana advised Rama."
Aranya Kanda,61,19,"When Lakshmana good-heartedly spoke this way, Rama self-collectedly made a headway for the search of Seetha along with Soumitri."
Aranya Kanda,61,20,"Those two sons of Dasharatha have started a thorough search for Seetha in forests, on mountains, also thus at rivers and lakes."
Aranya Kanda,61,21,"On searching whole of mountainsides of that Mt. Chitrakuta, where their hermitage is there, even in its caves, crags, and mountain peaks they have not found Seetha."
Aranya Kanda,61,22,"On exploring everywhere on that mountain Rama said to Lakshmana, ""oh, Soumitri, here on this mountain I do not descry auspicious Vaidehi."""
Aranya Kanda,61,23,While roving searchingly in Dandaka forest Lakshmana who is tormented by anguish said a sentence to his greatly resplendent brother Rama.
Aranya Kanda,61,24,"""Oh, insightful brother, you will reacquire Janaka's daughter Maithili, as Vishnu once subjugated Emperor Bali and reacquired this earth."""
Aranya Kanda,61,25,"But when the valiant Lakshmana addressed him in that way, Raghava whose thinking is marred by poignance spoke these pathetic words."
Aranya Kanda,61,27,"""This forest in its entirety, these lotus-lakes with their blossomed lotuses, and this mountain with its many caves and mountain-rapids, all are evidently searched. But, oh, sensible brother, I do not descry Vaidehi who is loftier than my lives."""
Aranya Kanda,61,28,"Lamenting in this way Rama languished owing to the abduction of Seetha and became a pitiable one, and while sadness besieging him he is perturbed for a moment."
Aranya Kanda,61,29,"All the limbs of Rama are fluttered, his faculty has become functionless, his fervour is frozen, he is forlorn and flustered, and such as he is he sank down suspiring swelteringly and lengthily."
Aranya Kanda,61,30,"Suspiring repeatedly he that lotus-eyed Rama shrieked repeatedly and loudly thus as, 'ha, Seetha...' with tears stifling his throat."
Aranya Kanda,61,31,"Though Rama has many kinsfolk who hold him dear he is now left with a single one, namely Lakshmana, and that obedient brother Lakshmana who is already anguished for Rama's sadness, then adjoining his palms obediently started to pacify Rama with divers methods."
Aranya Kanda,61,32,"But disavowing the word of advice that fell out from the cupped lips of Lakshmana, Rama stridently yelled again and again when his dear Seetha has become unseeable."
Aranya Kanda,62,1,"In not seeing Seetha that virtue-souled Rama's sagacity is marred by his anguish and he bewailed with his lotus-like eyes that are reddening like a pair of lotuses, raising is long arms."
Aranya Kanda,62,2,"Even if Raghava is not able to see Seetha in his presence he started talking to her in a kind of inarticulate wailing, as wailing pampered his articulacy because his speech took shelter of wailing instinct, and as he is cowed down by Love-god, and thus he started to vent out his heart in this way."
Aranya Kanda,62,3,"""Flowers fascinate you very much, my dear, hence you veil yourself with the full bloomed branches of Ashoka tree, but that alone is amplifying my anguish because you both have presently became tormentors."
Aranya Kanda,62,4,"""Maybe, both your thighs liken to the stalks of banana plants, thinking so, now you have lapped them in grovy banana plants, but I can distinguish which is which, thus now I caught sight of them, oh, lady, you are inapt at least to cover them from me."
Aranya Kanda,62,5,"""Oh, lady, you are facetiously glorying in the boscage of fully bloomed Karnikaara trees which is really wafting worry to me, rather than the fragrance of those flowers oh, glorious lady, enough, enough is this facetiousness of yours."
Aranya Kanda,62,6,"""I am aware of your humour, lady, and I know that you are jocose, but in a place like hermitage unmerited is this sort of raillery, even if it is good-natured. Hence, you come back, oh, wide-eyed one, your cottage is empty. [3-62-6, 7a]"
Aranya Kanda,62,7,"""Oh, Lakshmana, very evidently demons have either gorged up Seetha, or perhaps abducted her, because she is not returning to me who am whiny indeed for her. [3-62-7b, 8a]"
Aranya Kanda,62,8,"""Indeed these teary-eyed mobs of deer look as if to explain that nightwalkers have gluttonised my lady. [3-62-8b, 9a]"
Aranya Kanda,62,9,"""Ha! My graceful lady, to where you have strayed now... Ha! Chastely and best complexioned lady, now the ambition of my queen mother Kaikeyi will be fulfilled, as I breath my last owing to your straying... [3-62-8b, 9a]"
Aranya Kanda,62,10,"""I have come to forests with Seetha and have to go back to Ayodhya without Seetha. How, in all but name, can I step into an oblivion called my palace-chambers? [3-62-9b, 10a]"
Aranya Kanda,62,11,"""People will denounce me as a vigourless and pitiless person, and my ineptitude will indeed be self-evident, for Seetha is led away from me by some tactical being... [3-62-10b, 11a]"
Aranya Kanda,62,12,"""When the king of Mithila Janaka asks after the wellbeing of all the three of us after the completion of forest living, how do I have the face to stand him? [3-62-11b, 12a]"
Aranya Kanda,62,13,"""On seeing me without Seetha the king of Videha will be distraught by the perishing of his daughter, and he defiantly goes under the preponderance of perplexity... [3-62-12b, 13a]"
Aranya Kanda,62,14,"""Instead, I prefer not to go to the city Ayodhya that is ruled by Bharata, because it must be comforting to one and all under his rulership, but not to me as Seetha will not be with me... else if, that end of my life occurs now and if I were to go to heaven, even that heaven will be a void to me without her... I believe so... [3-62-13b, 14a]"
Aranya Kanda,62,15,"""Hence, Lakshmana, you go back to that auspicious city Ayodhya forsaking me in forests, because I have no existence without Seetha, isn't it! [3-62-14b, 15a]"
Aranya Kanda,62,16,"""On tightly hugging Bharata you shall tell him these words as I have said, 'Rama authorises you to reign the earth...'"
Aranya Kanda,62,17,"""Oh, efficacious Lakshmana, on revering my mothers Kaika, Sumitra, and Kausalya justifiably you tell them my good bye, and you as the one who effectuates whatever is assigned to you, you have to effortfully protect my mother Kausalya by doing whatever she says. [3-62-17b, 18]"
Aranya Kanda,62,19,"""Oh, the subjugator of unfriendly, Lakshmana... you shall clearly inform in detail about this perish of Seetha, also that of mine, to our mothers."
Aranya Kanda,62,20,"Thus Raghava, the dejected, neared every corner of the forest in his search, and bewailed because that lady with best plaits, Seetha, is not found and missing from him. Even Lakshmana became whey-faced, frantic-hearted, highly overwrought, by the fear of uncertainty looming large on them."
Aranya Kanda,63,1,"That prince Rama whom agony and anguish are distressing has become anxious in his mien, and he again drifted into a dire desperation while despairing his brother Lakshmana."
Aranya Kanda,63,2,"Rama who is sunken in a chasmal sorrow spoke this sentence while wailing sorrowfully, suspiring severely and scorchingly, and which sentence is seemly to his sensitivity, to Lakshmana who is already under the sway of sorrow."
Aranya Kanda,63,3,"""I am second to none among the blameworthy wrongdoers on this earth, thus I deem, and indeed woe followed by woe are getting at me in seriation to burst my heart and mind..."
Aranya Kanda,63,4,"""I might have definitely, habitually, and desirably committed damnable deeds in my previous births, and now the result of those impious deeds is very much ripened and has fallen on me, whereby I am entering misery after misery..."
Aranya Kanda,63,5,"""I am deprived of the kingdom, departed from my own people, mainly Seetha, my father departed and I am detached from my mother, and Lakshmana, when all these setbacks are very deeply thought over they are replenishing the haste of my agony..."
Aranya Kanda,63,6,"""All this sadness of mine has silenced physically and there is some peace on coming to these desolate forests, in association of Seetha, but with the dissociation of Seetha misery is again upshot, as with fire which flares up in a flash when fuel is added..."
Aranya Kanda,63,7,"""My noblewoman might be abducted by a demon, and on reaching the sky that lady who converses with a sweet voice might have wept a lot fearfully, and it is definite that she must have shouted a lot, untunefully..."
Aranya Kanda,63,8,"""Those two roundish bosoms of my ladylove which always deserved the application of pleasantly looking red-sandalwood's paste might definitely be unshiny, as they might be bedaubed with muddy blood when they are extricated from her body for devouring."
Aranya Kanda,63,9,"""She has a sweet, softish, and very clear talkativeness on her lips. That visage with such lips is crowned with a hairdo with hair lumped together and plaited, such as her visage is, it must have become unshiny on her going into the repression of demon, as with an unshiny moon when repressed in the mouth of eclipsing planet Raahu, it is definite..."
Aranya Kanda,63,10,"""The contours of the neck of that strait-laced ladylove of mine are always worthy for necklaces and chain-wears. The bloodthirsty demons would have indeed mangled that neck in a secluded place and they might have drunk her blood, it is definite..."
Aranya Kanda,63,11,"""While I was away from her in this uninhibited forest demons would have forcibly hauled her up when they are abducting that lady with broad-bright eyes, and she would have discordantly shrieked out like a piteous she-dove, it is definite..."
Aranya Kanda,63,12,"""Sitting very close to me on this stone's surface, oh, Lakshmana, she that well-mannered Seetha with bright smiles was speaking to you verbosely with all smiles..."
Aranya Kanda,63,13,"""Among rivers this Godavari is the best and it is an all the time cherished river to my ladylove, and I think she would have gone thereunto. But, at anytime she did not go there, singly..."
Aranya Kanda,63,14,"""Or, that lotus-faced, lotus-petal eyed Seetha has gone straight to bring lotuses! Nay, that idea itself is incongruous, for she never goes to get lotuses, indeed without me..."
Aranya Kanda,63,15,"""But has she really gone to this stand of thicket which is with flowered trees and with birds of divers kind! Nay, that thought also is incongruent, because she as a timid one is much scared of solitude..."
Aranya Kanda,63,16,"""Oh, Sun, you are the knower of performed and unperformed deeds in the world, a wittnesser of good and bad deeds in the world, tell me, who am woefully writhing, to where my ladylove strolled, or is she stolen..."
Aranya Kanda,63,17,"""Oh, Air, whatsoever is there in the world, wheresoever it might be, or whensoever it might have happened, and whichsoever it might be, and whencesoever it might exist, that cannot possibly be unknown to you. Hence, tell me of the lady from noble heritage... is she stolen, or slain, or strayed her steps..."" Thus Rama begged of the Eternals for locating Seetha."
Aranya Kanda,63,18,"To such a Rama whose physique is routed by his anguish in this way and who is insensately bewailing in that way, Soumitri whose courage is un-dispirited gave a justifiable and timely suggestion."
Aranya Kanda,63,19,"""Oh, noble brother, banish that anguish and brace yourself with fortitude, and let you be with spiritedness in her searching... indeed, there is no backsliding for spirited men in their enterprises in this world, even though the enterprises are highly impracticable..."""
Aranya Kanda,63,20,"When Soumitri of towering bravery is speaking this way, Rama, the enhancer of Raghu's lineage, gave no heed to it, and since he castaway his fortitude he again encountered an inexplicable anguish."
Aranya Kanda,64,1,"A pitiable one, such as he is, he spoke to Lakshmana in a pitiable voice, ""Lakshmana, go quickly to River Godavari and find out whether Seetha has gone to Godavari to fetch lotuses..."" [3-64-1, 2a]"
Aranya Kanda,64,2,"When Rama said thus to him Lakshmana again went to the charming River Godavari quickening his pace. [3-64-2b, 3a]"
Aranya Kanda,64,3,"Searching at many declivities which River Godavari has on its banks Lakshmana said to Rama, ""I do not espy her at ghats, declivities of riverbanks, and she is not replying though I shouted for her. [3-64-3b, 4a]"
Aranya Kanda,64,4,"""In fact, oh, Rama, to which place she that neutraliser of nervousness, namely Vaidehi, has got round to, or where that frailty is, that place is really incomprehensible to me... [3-64-4b, 5a]"
Aranya Kanda,64,5,"Rama who is already stupefied by anguish is now despaired on listening Lakshmana's words and he personally went straight to River Godavari, and staying nearby that river Rama shouted in this way, ""Seetha... where are you?"" [3-64-5b, 6]"
Aranya Kanda,64,7,"The forest creatures which were asked earlier have not said to Rama that a deservedly destructible demagogue of demons has divested him of Seetha, likewise now River Godavari which is now being asked has not informed Rama about Seetha."
Aranya Kanda,64,8,"Though the woeful Rama has asked her, and even though all the georgic beings impelled her to inform Rama the fact about his ladylove, River Godavari then remained mouthless about Seetha."
Aranya Kanda,64,9,"She that River Godavari has not informed Rama about Vaidehi just out of fear on recalling the mien and manoeuvres of malefic-minded Ravana, lest Ravana may drain her away."
Aranya Kanda,64,10,"Rama who is already in a rundown condition owing to the non-appearance of Seetha, is further rendered as a hopeless being by River Godavari in the matter of his catching a glimpse of Seetha, and such a Rama spoke to Saumitri."
Aranya Kanda,64,10,"""Oh, kind Lakshmana, this Godavari is talking to me anything but a reply. In the absence of Vaidehi, oh Lakshmana, really what is that unpleasant word I have to say to Vaidehi's father king Janaka, also thus to Vaidehi's mother-in-law and my mother Kausalya, when I meet them!

Aranya Kanda,64,11,"""Which Vaidehi is the remover of all my sadness who am a destitute of kingdom and surviving in forests on forest produce, such as she is, where has she gone, really! [3-64-12b, 13a]"
Aranya Kanda,64,12,"""Though I am distanced from my relatives I deemed that princess Seetha alone would be an evermore relative of mine. But now when that princess alone is unseen I deem that my sleepless nights would be lengthy. [3-64-13b, 14a]"
Aranya Kanda,64,13,"""I will search all these places of Godavari, Janasthaana and this mountain with many rapids, perhaps Seetha may be available somewhere. [3-64-14b, 15a]"
Aranya Kanda,64,14,"""Now all these burly animals are repeatedly looking at me as though to speak to me, oh, brave Lakshmana, this I reckon with their body language as it were. [3-64-15b, 16a]"
Aranya Kanda,64,15,"But on seeing them pryingly that tigerly-man Raghava has indeed asked them at once with a voice stifled with tears, ""where is Seetha?"" [3-64-16b, 17a]"
Aranya Kanda,64,16,"When that best king has asked, those animals rose to their feet in a trice and facing themselves southward showed skyward with their snouts. And while running in the direction in which Maithili is taken away they are stopping to look back at that lord of people, Rama. Thus they are repeatedly running, stopping and staring at Rama. [3-64-17b, 18, 19a]"
Aranya Kanda,64,17,"By which reason those animals are going in a southerly course on a southerly terrain, and stopping to peer at Rama, and again clamorously adopting the very same southerly course, Lakshmana ascertained that reason. [3-64-19b, 20a]"
Aranya Kanda,64,18,"On noticing the lingua franca and even the lingua persona of those animals, that imaginative Lakshmana spoke to his elder brother, alike a striver striving hard for some information. [3-64-20b, 21a]"
Aranya Kanda,64,19,"""Oh, godly brother, when you have asked these animals, 'where is Seetha,' they quickly rose to their feet, and as to how they are showing the track on the ground and the southern direction as well, thereby we may, for sure, go south-westward to know whether there is some information about her, or else, even that noble lady herself may be available there..."" [3-64-21a, 22, 23a]"
Aranya Kanda,64,20,"On saying ""Yes!"" to Lakshmana that illustrious Rama of Kakutstha sallied forth to southern direction followed by Lakshmana, scrutinising the earth on his walkway. [3-64-23b, 24a]"
Aranya Kanda,64,21,"Those two brothers who are proceeding while discussing among themselves have seen the walkway bestrewn with flowers fallen from a person. [3-64-24b, 25a]"
Aranya Kanda,64,22,"That valiant Rama who is anguished to see the drizzle of flowers fallen on the surface of earth spoke this word to Lakshmana who is equally anguished. [3-64-25b, 26a]"
Aranya Kanda,64,23,"""I recognise these flowers that are fallen here, oh, Lakshmana. In forest I gave them to Vaidehi and she tucked these very flowers in her bun. [3-64-26b, 27a]"
Aranya Kanda,64,24,"""These flowers are carefully safeguarded by the sun, as they are unwithered yet, by air as they are unswept by it, and by the glorious earth, as they are unspoilt by that, thus I deem that these naturals, sun, air, and earth are really proffering a helping hand to me. [3-64-27b, 28a]"
Aranya Kanda,64,25,"On saying thus to best one among men Lakshmana, that virtue-souled and dextrous Rama asked the mountain that is uproarious with rapids. [3-64-28b, 29a]"
Aranya Kanda,64,26,"""Oh, lord among the earth-bolstered mountains, have you somehow seen a beauty by all her limbs, foregone by me in beautiful woodlands?"" [3-64-29b, 30a]"
Aranya Kanda,64,27,"Reply of mountain to Rama:""Oh, lordly bolsterer of earth, lord Rama, I have somehow seen a beauty by all her limbs, foregone by you in beautiful woodlands.'"
Aranya Kanda,64,28,"Because his question is unanswered he is enraged as with a lion enraging at a puny animal, and then he spoke to the mountain, ""show me that golden tinged, golden limbed Seetha, oh, mountain, no sooner than I devastate all your apices, apiece..."" [3-64-30b, 31]"
Aranya Kanda,64,32,"When Rama spoke to the mountain in this way, that mountain echoed as if it is revealing Seetha, but actually it has not revealed Seetha to Raghava."
Aranya Kanda,64,30,"Then Rama of Dasharatha said to the hefty mountain, ""When the infernos of my arrows will burn you down completely and when you will be pared down ashes, you shall be grassless, treeless and tender-leafless, and thus you become a meritless mountain... hence, show Seetha before becoming so...

Aranya Kanda,64,33,"On scrutinising the overly trodden footprints of Seetha and the demon, and a broken bow, broken quiver, and broken and variously bestrewn chariot also, then Rama became baffle-hearted and said to his dear brother Lakshmana. [3-64-37b, 38]"

Aranya Kanda,64,72,"Rama on saying thus with his eyes reddening in fury, his lappet-fold of lips jerking spasmodically, he girded up his jute-cloths and deerskin and twined up the mass of his matted-hair."
Aranya Kanda,64,73,"When the disposition of that venturesome and infuriated Rama has become in that way holocaustic, it is like that of Rudra, the All-Inflamer god, when He became like this in earlier times, intending to inflame the Triple-Cities."
Aranya Kanda,64,66,"On saying so that illustrious Rama, the delighter of world, grabbed his bow from Lakshmana and gripped it tightly, unholstered a deadly and dazzling arrow from his quiver which is like a poisonous serpent, and readying it on the bowstring of his bow, that Rama, the vanquisher of enemies fastnesses, who looked like the Ear-End-Fire, spoke this sentence.

Aranya Kanda,65,1,"Lakshmana on seeing Rama who is searing and careworn owing to the abduction of Seetha, blazing like the doomsday inferno, twinned with the notion of rendering the worlds into nonentity, kenning at his stringed bow, keen to blaze away entire universe, suspiring again and again, and who is alike Rudra at the end of era, and whose highly infuriated persona Lakshmana has not seen previously, became pale-faced and spoke to Rama with folded palms."
Aranya Kanda,65,4,"""Previously, you were self-collected and self-controlled and delighted in the wellbeing of all the beings. But presently, slipping into fury you are discarding your own disposition, which is unapt of you..."

Thus Lakshmana appealed to ireful Rama."
Aranya Kanda,66,1,"While Rama is bewailing like a forlorn as his anguish is scorching him, rendered impoverished with an inanimate heart as a high passion possessed him, Lakshmana, the son of Sumitra, suppliantly gripped his feet and started to address him. [4-66-1, 2]"

Aranya Kanda,67,1,Even though Rama is elder to Lakshmana he gleaned the ultimate tenor of Lakshmana's words when Lakshmana just said them expediently because Raghava is a best gleaner of the gist of advises.
Aranya Kanda,67,2,"Such as he is that dextrous Rama on controlling his highly heightening fury, propping against his bedazzling bow spoke this to Lakshmana."
Aranya Kanda,67,3,"""What is to be done by us, oh, dear boy... or, whereto we might go, or, by which device Seetha is discernable... Lakshmana, now you think of it, clearly..."
Aranya Kanda,67,4,"To such a Rama who is tormented by anguish, Lakshmana said, ""it will be apt of you to search this Janasthaana alone which is rife with many demons, and replete with manifold trees and climber-plants..."
Aranya Kanda,67,5,"""Here there are unclimbable mountains, glens and glyphs as well. There are divers and pernicious caverns tumultuous with diverse packs of predators, and here are the mansions of kinnaraa-s and palaces of gandharva-s, as well... [3-67-5b, 6]"
Aranya Kanda,67,6,"""It will be apt of you to steadfastly search in them along with me, and oh, best one among men, your sort of literati and clever-souls will be unfluctuating in calamities like the mountains unfluctuating in windstorms..."" Lakshmana said so Rama. [3-67-6, 7, 8a]"
Aranya Kanda,67,7,"When Lakshmana said in this way to that ireful Rama, he roved entire forest along with Lakshmana readying a crescent-shaped razor-sharp deadly arrow on his bow. [3-67-8b, 9a]"
Aranya Kanda,67,8,"Then Rama beheld Jataayu who is akin to a mountaintop in his gleam, and a best beatific brave bird among all the birds, but bloodstained and buckling on earth. [3-67-9b, 10a]"
Aranya Kanda,67,9,"On beholding him who is like a mountaintop in his gleam, Rama said to Lakshmana, ""This one has gluttonised Seetha, the princess from Vaidehi, there is no doubt about it... [3-67-10b, 11a]"
Aranya Kanda,67,10,"""It is apparent that this demon skulks in the forest in the semblance of an eagle, and having gluttonised that wide-eyed Seetha he is now reposing comfortably. I will eliminate him with deadly arrows, whose arrowheads blaze away and which shoot off straightly..."" Thus Rama declared. [3-67-11b, 12]"
Aranya Kanda,67,13,"On saying thus and on readying a crescent-shaped razor-sharp deadly arrow on his bow, that ireful Rama rushed towards the eagle, as though to a-tremble the whole of the earth that which is within the perimeter of oceans."
Aranya Kanda,67,14,"But that bird spewing up frothy blood pathetically appealed to such an ireful son of Dasharatha, namely Rama, in a pathetic tone."
Aranya Kanda,67,15,"""Oh, boy Rama, blest is your eternality, for whom you are searching as with the search of a rejuvenescent herb in the vast of forest, Ravana stole that lady and my lives, too..."
Aranya Kanda,67,16,"""I have seen that lady while being stolen by brute-forced Ravana when you and even Lakshmana absented from her..."

Aranya Kanda,67,17,"""This is his charioteer drop dead onto earth by my wings... when I am overtired Ravana gashed my wings and flew skyward taking Seetha of Videha kingdom with him, and it will be inapt of you to kill me who am already killed by the demon..."" Thus Jataayu appealed to Rama. [3-67-19, 20]"
Aranya Kanda,67,21,Rama jettisoned his forceful bow when he heard the much desired news about Seetha while hugging that kingly eagle Jataayu.
Aranya Kanda,67,22,"Even though Rama is comparatively a bold person he involuntarily fell down to ground, as the onefold scorch of anguish for Seetha is doubled by this predicament of Jataayu, and he wept over Jataayu."
Aranya Kanda,67,23,"Jataayu is supine on a single-strait passable for a single-person and he is suspiring for several times, and on seeing such Jataayu Rama became anguished and spoke this to Soumitri."
Aranya Kanda,67,24,"""Mislaid is my kingdom and I am mislocated into forests, Seetha is misplaced and now this mischance of death on this bird... this kind of misfortune of mine incinerates even Agni, the Divine-Incinerator..."
Aranya Kanda,67,25,"""Even if it were to be a plethoric and limitless ocean, and now if I were to enter it, or take a swim to the other shore of blissfulness, even that Lord of Rivers runs completely dry, owing to my misfortune, it is definite..."
Aranya Kanda,67,26,"""There will not be any greater unfortunate being in this world than me, even if all the sessile and mobile beings are put together, by whom such a complicated catastrophic enmeshment as this is derived..."
Aranya Kanda,67,27,"""This decrepit kingly eagle is the friend of my father who is terminally gashed and recumbent on the floor owing only to the backlash of my fortune..."" So lamented Rama for the wounded eagle Jataayu."
Aranya Kanda,67,28,"Thus, lamenting in that way for many times Raghava patted the body of Jataayu along with Lakshmana instancing his parental regard."
Aranya Kanda,67,29,"On hugging that kingly eagle whose wings are hacked off and who is bloodstained, and on uttering this much, ""she who is identical with my lives,... where is that Maithili..."" Rama collapsed to earth."
Aranya Kanda,68,1,"Rama on seeing that eagle felled to ground by the atrocious Ravana, said this sentence to Soumitri who is an asset for good companionability."
Aranya Kanda,68,2,"""While this bird is venturing in my concern the demon felled him in combat and he is leaving off his lives owing to me, definitely..."
Aranya Kanda,68,3,"""Obviously, lives in his body are very feeble, oh, Lakshmana, it is natural, isn't it, and he looks highly anguished with a dulled voice..."" Thus on saying to Lakshmana, Rama then spoke to Jataayu."
Aranya Kanda,68,4,"""Oh, Jataayu, if you are in fine fettle to further reiterate words, relate about Seetha, let safe betide you, and recount how you are murdered, too..."
Aranya Kanda,68,5,"""What is the reason for Ravana in stealing that noblewoman, and even what is the wrong I have committed in his respect, keeping which in view that Ravana stole my ladylove..."
Aranya Kanda,68,6,"""How was that moon similar heart-stealing face of hers at that time of abduction, oh, best bird, and even what are the words she uttered when being abducted..."
Aranya Kanda,68,7,"""What is his stamina of that demon? What is his form? And what are his strategies? And where is his stronghold? Oh, sire, tell me while I ask you inquisitively..."" Rama urged Jataayu thus for information."
Aranya Kanda,68,8,Then that warm-hearted Jataayu with his eyes rolling upwards saw Rama and with a fluttery voice said this sentence to Rama who is wailing like an orphan.
Aranya Kanda,68,9,"""Resorting to his illusionistic devices like creating an immense and tumultuous windstorm and cloud-cover, the flagitious chief of demons Ravana abducted Seetha..."
Aranya Kanda,68,10,"""That night walker hacked both my wings when I was overtired, and went southward taking the princess of Videha, Seetha, along with him..."
Aranya Kanda,68,11,"""My sight is spinning and my lives are stifled, oh, Raghava, I am now seeing golden trees with cuscus grass as their treetops..."
Aranya Kanda,68,12,"""In which spell of time Ravana has gone taking away Seetha, that spell is named as Vinda... if any riches are lost during that spell, the original possessor of those riches will repossess them very quickly... oh, Kakutstha, he that Ravana is unmindful of that fact and stole Seetha only to loose her...

Aranya Kanda,68,13,"""On stealing your ladylove Janaki, that chief of demons, Ravana, will ruin himself, as with a fish which swallows a baited fishhook... [3-68-13b, c]"
Aranya Kanda,68,14,"""Impractical is your anguishing for the daughter of Janaka, as you will delight yourself with Vaidehi in no time, on killing that Ravana in the vanguard of a war..."" Thus saying Jataayu paused for a while."
Aranya Kanda,68,15,"Though Jataayu is speaking on to Rama with an alert mind, blood freely flowed from his mouth with shreds of flesh as death verged on him, even then he struggled to say."
Aranya Kanda,68,16,"""That demon is the son of Vishravasa... literally... the brother of Kubera..."" on saying thus, that lord of birds released his lives, which are unobtainable for oneself."
Aranya Kanda,68,17,"But the lives of Jataayu departing from his body went into thin air before the very eyes of Rama who is still speaking to him with folded-palms, ""tell... tell more..."""
Aranya Kanda,68,18,"Jataayu flopped his head on earth, sprawled his feet on ground, and then his body collapsed onto the surface of earth writhing jerkily."
Aranya Kanda,68,19,"He who is worsened by very many mishaps that Rama, on seeing the mountainous eagle whose eyes are bloodshot and whose lives have gone, said this way to Soumitri..."
Aranya Kanda,68,20,"""This bird which for years together lived fearlessly in Dandaka forest, a habitat of demons, that bird wilted to death, because of me..."
Aranya Kanda,68,21,"""He who has longevity over many years, who actively strived for a long for rectitude, he is now killed and prostrating before the Time, because of me... alas... it is indeed impossible to infringe the Time..."

Aranya Kanda,68,24,"""Universally noticeable are the protective, prepotent, principled ones that are the followers of probity, oh, Soumitri, even though their births are avian or bestial..."
Aranya Kanda,68,25,"""To me, oh, enemy-inflamer, oh, gentle Lakshmana, anguish caused by Seetha's abduction is not that much, when compared with the anguish caused by the perish of this eagle, that too, because of me..."
Aranya Kanda,68,26,"""As to how the celebrated and highly renowned king Dasharatha is venerable and honourable for me, likewise this lord of birds is also a venerable and honourable one to me..."
Aranya Kanda,68,27,"""Oh, Soumitri, get the firewood and I will produce fire by friction of two sticks, as I wish to cremate this lord of birds who expired because of me..."
Aranya Kanda,68,28,"""Oh, Soumitri, I will mount this lord of realm of birds onto the pyre and cremate him who is killed by a feral demon..."" Thus saying to Lakshmana, Rama said this to dead eagle Jataayu."
Aranya Kanda,68,29,"""Oh, greatly mighty king of eagles, by me cremated ritually and by me aptly consented to, you depart to the unexcelled heavenly worlds... you depart to those worlds that are destined for the virtuosos of Vedic-rituals, and to those worlds that are destined for the practisers of ascesis amid Five-Ritual-fires, and to those that are destined for un-retreating combatants, and to those worlds that destined for the donors of lands..."" So said Rama to the departed Jataayu. [3-68-29, 30]"
Aranya Kanda,68,31,"On saying that way, that ethical-souled Rama mounted that lord of birds onto the pyre and he sorrowfully incinerated that eagle in a flaring fire of pyre, as he would do in respect of his own deceased relative."
Aranya Kanda,68,32,"Then that resolute Rama on going into forest along with Soumitri hunted a robust-bodied, big Rohi animal, or, Kesari animal, and then he spread sacred grass on ground to place that offering to the deceased soul of that bird."
Aranya Kanda,68,33,"On drawing up the flesh of that Rohi animal and lumping it to gobbets, that highly observant Rama placed those gobbets on pleasant greenish pasturelands as obsequial offerings in respect of that bird Jataayu."
Aranya Kanda,68,34,"Rama immediately chanted Vedic hymns that are employed in such funerals of one's own paternal people, as Brahmans say that those hymns are employable in such rites as they lead the soul of the departed to heaven."
Aranya Kanda,68,35,"Then both the sons of that notable man, namely Dasharatha, on going to River Godavari they have oblated waters for that king of eagles, Jataayu."
Aranya Kanda,68,36,Both of the Raghava-s took funeral baths in the waters of River Godavari and then made water oblations to the king of eagles.
Aranya Kanda,68,37,"That king of eagle Jataayu, who has performed a creditworthy deed of stalling and combating Ravana, but who is felled by that Ravana, went away to the merited and auspicious heavenly realms of his own, as and when consecrated by sublime sage like Rama."
Aranya Kanda,68,38,"Even those two, Rama and Lakshmana, on performing water oblations in respect of that best bird Jataayu, and on assertively giving thought to the information given by Jataayu, they like the chiefs of gods, namely Vishnu and Indra, went to southerly woods when their mind is set to search for Seetha."
Aranya Kanda,69,1,"In this way, Raghava-s on offering water oblations to Jataayu went southwestward in the forest and proceeded looking around for Seetha."
Aranya Kanda,69,2,"On going in southwest direction, both the Ikshvaku-s wielding bows, arrows, and swords, have come about a pathway which is an off the beaten track."
Aranya Kanda,69,3,"That pathway is thickly wrapped in and penned up with numerous trees, climber plants, and hedgerows from all over, thus that is jammed, blocked and horrid in its appearance."
Aranya Kanda,69,4,"On taking up the southern direction, and on crossing over that highly horrendous and thick of the forest, both those spryly energetic brothers moved ahead, speedily."
Aranya Kanda,69,5,"Thereafter, both the highly vigorous Raghava-s have entered the impassable Kraunca forest, on going three krosa-s from Janasthaana."
Aranya Kanda,69,6,"Those two brothers who are disquieted by the abduction of Seetha are now agog to find her, and they intently explored that forest temporising there and there. That forest is evocative of a congeries of many a black-cloud, and it embodies numerous flowers on many a flowered tree, numerous flights of birds flitting over them, and numerous animals sprawling under them, and with them that forest is as though highly rejoiced everywhere. [3-69-6, 7]"
Aranya Kanda,69,7,"Then, both the brothers on passing over that Kraunca forest and on going from there eastwardly on a three-krosha route, those sons of Dasharatha have seen a horrendous forest in between Kraunca forest and Matanga hermitage, which is overspread with various thicketed and impassable trees, and over-sprawled by numerous gigantic predators and vulturine birds, and on scrutinising such a forest everywhere, there they saw a cave in a mountain, which is abyssal, equal to infernal region, and ever enshrouded by gloom. [3-69-8. 9, 10]"
Aranya Kanda,69,11,"On getting at that cave those manly-tigers have seen a demoness nearby that cave, who is massive in shape and misshapen in her face."
Aranya Kanda,69,9,"Both the brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, have seen a demoness there, who is an inducer of horror to the dunderheaded dullards, traumatic in her acts and truculent in her appearance, pot-bellied, pierce-fanged, overblown, pachydermatous, head hair shaggy, body shape lumpy-bumpy, and she is going on eating massive beasts. [3-69-12, 13]"
Aranya Kanda,69,14,"Drawing nigh of those valorous brothers who are journeying on their way, that demoness actually clung onto Lakshmana who is going ahead of his elder brother, saying, ""come... let's romance..."""
Aranya Kanda,69,11,"Closeting Soumitri in her embrace she told him this sentence, ""I am Ayomukhi, by my name... you won me by your heroic personality, by that way, none can win me over... thus, you alone are my lover... oh, hero, oh, my husband... you will romance with me on mountaintops, in rivers, and on sandy isles, till the end of this life..."" So is the love prattle of that demoness Ayomukhi. [3-69-15, 16]"
Aranya Kanda,69,17,"When said that way that enemy-suppressor Lakshmana became furious, and upraising his sword he sheared off her nose, one ear, and one of her breasts."
Aranya Kanda,69,18,"When her nose and ear are cut off that demoness of hideous mien yelled highly in a high voice, and she rushed off as she had rushed in at Lakshmana."
Aranya Kanda,69,19,"When she fled those two brothers who are the eliminators of the friends of their enemies, have travelled further into the forest and entered a dense area of that forest, with their spiritedness as their guiding force."
Aranya Kanda,69,20,"Though Lakshmana is the one with preparedness, properness, and pureness and thus a highly fulgent one by his persona, he prayfully said this sentence to his brother Rama whose anima is radiantly fulgorous."
Aranya Kanda,69,21,"""My left arm is strongly shuddering and my heart is as though distraught... and even undesirable forebodings are also bidding fair..."
Aranya Kanda,69,22,"""Oh, exalted brother, thereby you be at the ready by paying attention to my expedient words... these forebodings are indeed portending to me as if some hazard is immediately ensuing..."
Aranya Kanda,69,23,"""This eerily dreadful bird known to be Vanjulaka is loudly ululating as though presaging our triumph in any given conflict that may ensue..."" So said Lakshmana to Rama."
Aranya Kanda,69,24,"When those two brothers are searching entire forest for Seetha in that way, they heard a boisterous brouhaha emanated as though to completely shatter down that forest."
Aranya Kanda,69,20,"As though an unbearable windstorm muffles up the forest, that forest's cacophony appeared to be unbearably filling up that forest."
Aranya Kanda,69,25,"As though an unbearable windstorm muffles up the sky, that forest's cacophony appeared to be unbearably filling up that forest."
Aranya Kanda,69,26,But desiring to know the source of that noise that sword-wielder Rama has seen a gigantically giant-bodied and gigantesque-chested demon in a section of brushwood along with his younger brother Lakshmana.
Aranya Kanda,69,27,"Then they both had to drew nigh of a waylaying demon Kabandha, who is situated frontally with an overgrown body, which is neckless, ergo headless, ergo mouth in paunch."
Aranya Kanda,69,28,"That diabolical demon is peaking like a huge mountain, his hair is horripilate and thickset, and his gleam is like a dark cloud, and his sounding is like a thunder."
Aranya Kanda,69,25,"Only one ochry eye blazing like the tongue of an inferno is there on his forehead, which forehead situated on his chest. That single eye with incisive and sharp-sight is broad beaming and wide angling, on which there are winglike eyelids. That monster is now licking his giant mouth that is stuffed with spearhead like fangs, as he has just finished a gobble, and the brothers had to drew nigh of such a demon. [3-69-29, 30]"
Aranya Kanda,69,31,"He is eating the highly brutal bears, lions, predators, and elephants, and he is outstretching both of his deadly arms, each of which is stretchable to a yojana distance, and the bothers neared such a demon."
Aranya Kanda,69,27,"That demon stayed waylaying the pathway of both the brothers who chanced there, while he is catching bears, divers flights of birds, and numerous choicest animals of those and those herds, gripping them with both of his long-reaching hands and hauling towards his mouth at his paunch, or dropping them off if they are unpalatable, and the brothers reached nearby of such a demon. [3-69-32, 33a]"
Aranya Kanda,69,28,"On travelling just a krosha distance, then they have seen Kabandha, whose body is colossal, and who is heinous and hideous, and who is like living trunk fenced by its shoulders and arms, and who by his physique is very deadly in appearance. [3-69-33b, 34]"
Aranya Kanda,69,35,"He that overlong-armed Kabandha outstretching his overlong arms snatched both of the Raghava-s, keeping them side-by-side in his fists, and wringing them with his might."
Aranya Kanda,69,36,"Though they are the grapplers with swords and brandishers of unerring bows, and though outblazing is their pneuma and outstanding is their dexterity, both of those great mighty brothers lost control and had to yield themselves to that demon when he captured and dragged them."
Aranya Kanda,69,31,"In that situation, that valiant Rama, the legatee of Raghava-s, is not verily anguished owing to his courage, but Lakshmana is very much anguished, as if he is callow and in an unsheltered state, and he that younger brother of Raghava, namely Lakshmana, also dejectedly said this to Rama, the legatee of Raghava-s. [3-69-37, 38a]"
Aranya Kanda,69,32,"""Oh, valiant brother, see me, who am out of control on my inner-self, and gone into the control of the demon... oh, Raghava, you leave me and get yourself released from the grip of the demon... [3-69-38b, 39a]"
Aranya Kanda,69,33,"""Indeed offer me as an offering to this quiddity, and you seek safety at your pleasure... and you will reach Vaidehi shortly... this is my belief... [3-69-39b, 40a]"
Aranya Kanda,69,34,"""Oh, Kakutstha, on regaining the kingdom of our father and forefathers, and when enthroned, oh, Rama, it will be apt of you to reminisce me always..."" So said Lakshmana to Rama. [3-69-40b, 41a]"
Aranya Kanda,69,35,"But when Lakshmana said that way, Rama said to Soumitri, ""Fret not thyself, futilely... oh, brave one, your king of persons will not get dismayed, futilely... [3-69-41b, 42a]"
Aranya Kanda,69,36,"In the meantime, that ruthless, log-armed, fiercest demon Kabandha thunderously asked those brothers, Rama and Lakshmana. [3-69-42b, 43a]"
Aranya Kanda,69,37,"""Who are you two? Your shoulders are akin to the bull-humps, and you are shouldering longbows and brandishing broad swords, how have you come about this province? For god's sake, I come across my most dainty morsel... [3-69-43b, 44a]"
Aranya Kanda,69,38,"""What business you have here, and for which reason you have come here... you chanced for me who am sitting here and painfully ravenous... [3-69-44b, 45a]"
Aranya Kanda,69,39,"""Though you are with arrows, bows and swords, and though you are like bulls with sharp horns ready to gore... but they are all a waste, as your life has readily become ungainful on reaching nigh of my sight and arms..."" So said Kabandha, in his arrogant tone. [3-69-45b, 46a]"
Aranya Kanda,69,40,"On hearing that sentence of that vile-souled Kabandha, Rama said this to Lakshmana with a wilted face. [3-69-46b, 47a]"
Aranya Kanda,69,41,"""Oh, truth-valiant Lakshmana, now coming to pass is a worst catastrophe, after a worse catastrophe, after a catastrophe...namely, the expiration at the hands of this demon presently, and the expropriation of Seetha previously, and the expulsion from kingship, still previously... nonetheless, without coming across that ladylove, this disastrous despair of ending our lives is coming about... [3-69-47b, 48a]"
Aranya Kanda,69,42,"""Oh, Lakshmana, the efficacy of Time is preponderant and proportional among all beings... oh, manly-tiger, why generalisation... see, as to how yourself and even myself are entangled in the tangles of life, even though we assert ourselves to be brave and best... [3-69-48b, 49a]"
Aranya Kanda,69,43,"Oh, Lakshmana, to show its impact on each and every being Time, or God is unencumbered and unremitting... may he be a brave one or a brawny one... or, may they be those that have perfected their missilery... when Time chances their nigh, they have to founder... as with a sandy levee... [3-69-49b, 50]"
Aranya Kanda,69,51,"Rama being the son of Dasharatha is an indomitable one, besides, a firmly and factually valorous one, by which he earned a great renown, and he on telling thus, and on looking over that recalcitrantly vengeful Soumitri, then Rama readied himself by his own steadied thinking."
Aranya Kanda,70,1,"On prying at those two brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, who are completely stowed in the hangman's halter-like arms of the demon, and who are enduring within it, Kabandha said this sentence to them."
Aranya Kanda,70,2,"""Oh, excellent Kshatriya-s, on seeing me who am miserably famished, really what for you stay cool? You are the godsend gobs of mine, and hence now you are almost dead..."" So said Kabandha to brothers."
Aranya Kanda,70,3,"Lakshmana who is possessed by anguish, and who is determined to wreck revenge on that demon, said these expedient and advisable words to Rama on hearing that demon's word."
Aranya Kanda,70,4,"""This scurrilous demon quickly hauled in you and me to his face level, and he will quickly take us in, therefore, we will have to swiftly hack off his lengthy arms at his shoulder level..."
Aranya Kanda,70,5,"""Gruesome is this gargantuan bodied demon, and triumphing over just with his arms he has utterly devastated this province, and he now wishes to end us..."
Aranya Kanda,70,6,"""Oh, king Raghava, killing the non-aggressive is tantamount to the killing of animals that are led into Vedic-ritual in its midst is despicable to the kings..."
Aranya Kanda,70,7,"On hearing all of their conversation that demon is infuriated, and then widely opening his ferocious mouth he started to wolf down both of them."
Aranya Kanda,70,8,"Then both the Raghava-s are very highly gladdened as the demon is hauling them towards his eye at shoulder level, and as they are the brothers with circumspection, they instantly mutilated his arms right at their shoulder joints only with two swords."
Aranya Kanda,70,9,"Then that dextrous Rama with an unrestrained speed hacked off the right arm, and valiant Lakshmana on his part hewed down the left arm that speedily."
Aranya Kanda,70,10,"He that overlong-armed Kabandha fell down with mangled arms, reverberated the sky, earth, and all of the ten points of horizon with a cacophonous voice, like a black-thunderous-cloud."
Aranya Kanda,70,11,"That demon on seeing at his dissevered shoulders on which the gushes of blood are overflowing, he self-piteously asked those two bold ones thus as, ""who are you..."""
Aranya Kanda,70,12,"When that great mighty Kabandha is asking thus, Lakshmana who has prosperous characteristics has informed him about Rama of Kakutstha, an unremitting dynasty."
Aranya Kanda,70,13,"""He is known to people by the name of Rama, the legatee of Ikshvaku dynasty, and you know me as his younger brother, Lakshmana, by my name..."
Aranya Kanda,70,14,"""Countervailed from kingdom by mother this Rama is bluntly sent to forests, and he is on the rove in great forests along with me ad his wife..."
Aranya Kanda,70,15,"""A demon stole his wife while he whose leverage is like that of god is living in the unpopulated forest... and wishing to retrieve her we came here..."
Aranya Kanda,70,16,"""But who are you? Your legs are broken, and your mouth is infernal, yet it is on your chest, and alike a topless, rootless tree trunk you are sprawling in the forest, how so, or, for what reason?"" Lakshmana asked the demon thus."
Aranya Kanda,70,17,"But Kabandha is highly delighted when Lakshmana spoke that way, as the words of Indra came to his memory, and he said these words in reply."
Aranya Kanda,70,18,"""Oh, manly tigers, by my providence you are revealed to me... welcome to you... and providentially sheared are these shackles, called my two arms, by you..."
Aranya Kanda,70,19,"""Oh, manly tiger, actually how this form of mine is disfigured, of course owing to my distrustful behaviour, that you may listen while I narrate it to you."
Aranya Kanda,71,1,"""Oh, great dextrous Rama with great daring and dashing, as to how the physique of sun, moon, and even that of Indra is there now, my physique was also like that earlier, an unbelievable mien and renowned in all the three worlds... [3-71-1, 2a]"
Aranya Kanda,71,2,"""Such as I was with an admirable body, disguising myself in this kind of horrendous form which is utterly dreadful to the world, I was scaring the forest living sages, there and there..."
Aranya Kanda,71,3,"""On one day, when a great sage named Sthuulashira was collecting divers forest produce for his Vedic-ritual, I scared him with this ugly form and I even exasperated him... [3-71-3b, 4a]"
Aranya Kanda,71,4,"""On seeing me that sage who is an enforcer of deadly curse cursed me in this way, 'that which is presently diabolic and despicable form of yours, hereinafter you will abide in this form alone...' [3-71-4b, 5a]"
Aranya Kanda,71,5,"""When I begged that enraged sage as, 'even if I have committed this blasphemy owing to my blasphemous fate, will there be an end to this blasphemed form of mine, or not...' and then he spoke this word to me... [3-71-5b, 6a]"
Aranya Kanda,71,6,""" 'When Rama incinerates you in an uninhibited forest on chopping off your shoulders, then you will regain your own grand and auspicious form...' So said the sage to me... [3-71-6b, 7a]"
Aranya Kanda,71,7,"""Oh, Lakshmana, you may know as the most handsome son of Danu, and this misshapen form has chanced on me owing the ire of Indra in battlefield... [3-71-7b, 8a]"
Aranya Kanda,71,8,"""I have gladdened Grandparent Braham with severe ascesis and He granted longevity to me, and then a kind of recalcitrance touched off in my mind... [3-71-8b, 9a]"

[3-71-12b, 13a]"
Aranya Kanda,71,13,"""When I said to Indra this way, Indra devised for me yojana long arms, also that way a rapier-fanged mouth in my paunch... [3-71-13b, 14a]"
Aranya Kanda,71,14,"""Such as I am, I have been eating the lions, elephants, animals, and tigers that are on the move in this forest, hauling them in with both of my overlong arms... [3-71-14b, 15a]"

Aranya Kanda,71,20,"When Raghava is said thus by that Kabandha, the heir of Danu, that duty-minded Rama said this word to Kabandha while Lakshmana is hearing. [3-71-20b, 21a]"

Aranya Kanda,72,2,"On his part Lakshmana started to torch that pyre with highly sparkling torches from all over, and even that pyre too suddenly blazed with blazes from all over."
Aranya Kanda,72,3,"That massy body of Kabandha is full with fat and while it is being cooked, it is in simile with a massy gob of ghee. But the Fire had to stew that body tardily, though that stewed meat is Fire's favourite dish, because of that body's massiveness."
Aranya Kanda,72,4,"In a trice that highly dynamic Kabandha zoomed up shoving off that pyre, and he is now attired in lily-white vestments and angelic garlands, and appeared like a fumeless fire."
Aranya Kanda,72,5,"Then highly gladdened Kabandha jumped up onto sky from the pyre, and there he is irradiant with unsullied clothing, and fineries decorated on every limb."

Kishkindha Kanda,3,35,"""Should a king have this kind of work accomplishers with a variety of virtues, all his objectives will be achieved impelled by such an envoy's words..."" Rama thus said to Lakshmana."
Kishkindha Kanda,3,36,"When said thus by Rama, wise-worded Lakshmana spoke to that monkey and the minister of Sugreeva, namely Hanuma, the son of Air-god, who is equally a wise-worded one."
Kishkindha Kanda,3,37,"""The virtues of that great soul Sugreeva are known to us, oh, scholarly monkey, we for our part are in search of that lord of fly-jumpers Sugreeva alone..."

Kishkindha Kanda,6,14,"Thus said Sugreeva then entered the cavernous cave of that mountain quickly, to fulfil the yearning of Raghava."
Kishkindha Kanda,6,15,"On taking and bringing the parcel of that upper cloth with the auspicious jewellery, ""This, you see..."" saying thus that monkey started to show them to Rama."
Kishkindha Kanda,6,16,"Then on taking that cloth and also the auspicious jewellery, Rama became like mist filled moon with overfilling tears."
Kishkindha Kanda,6,17,"But he who is blemished by tears that outpoured in all his friendship with Seetha, leaving off his courage fell on the ground wailing, 'oh, dear... oh, dear...'"
Kishkindha Kanda,6,18,"The more he hugged those best decorative ornaments close to his heart, the more he hissed like a wrathful serpent in a snake pit."
Kishkindha Kanda,6,19,With the unending rush of tears he saw Lakshmana at his side and started to wail piteously.
Kishkindha Kanda,6,20,"""Lakshmana, see this upper cloth and these ornaments too of Vaidehi, shed from her body and dropped onto the ground while she is being abducted."
Kishkindha Kanda,6,21,"""Seetha must have definitely dropped these ornaments onto pastureland, for they appear to be in their original shape, indeed."" So said Rama to Lakshmana."
Kishkindha Kanda,6,22,"When Rama thus said Lakshmana said this, ""I know not the bracelets and I know not the earrings But because I always salute her feet I know these anklets well..."
Kishkindha Kanda,6,23,""" Then Rama sadly asked to Sugreeva, ""tell me Sugreeva, towards which country that ferocious looking demon abducted my dear one dearest than my lives, as spotted by you..."

Kishkindha Kanda,8,11,"Then on seeing Rama standing there with greatly mighty Lakshmana, Sugreeva cast his sight with his bolting eyes around that forest."
Kishkindha Kanda,8,12,"He that lord of monkeys Sugreeva has then seen a well flowered sala tree not far off from there, covered with some leaves and bedecked with honeybees."
Kishkindha Kanda,8,13,"And Sugreeva broke off one branch of that sala tree that is with many leaves and a well charming one, and spreading it out for Rama, he sat on it with Raghava."
Kishkindha Kanda,8,14,On seeing those two sitting on a branch then Hanuma also broke a branch of sala tree for the modest Lakshmana and seated Lakshmana on it.
Kishkindha Kanda,8,15,"Then to him, who by now is comfortably sitting on a flowery mat laid by the bestrewn flowers of sala trees on that best mountain like a quiet ocean, to such Rama who by his very presence delights hearts, that gladsome Sugreeva said this in friendship with his gentle and gracious words that fluttered with happiness while he spoke.

Kishkindha Kanda,8,20,"Thus said by Sugreeva, the resplendent and virtuous Rama, the patron of righteousness replied Sugreeva as though laughing off the task."
Kishkindha Kanda,8,21,"""Helping is the fruit of friendship while harming is enemy's trait, hence I wish to kill him today only, that abductor of your wife..."" Rama continued thus."
Kishkindha Kanda,8,21,"""These are my arrows winged from pinion of the hern, oh, highly fortunate Sugreeva, these that are decorated in gold sparkle sharply like the Thunderbolts of Indra, and they are begotten from the reed forest of Kartikeya, ends tied with eagles feathers for fins, smooth are their nodes, sharp are their tips that pierce sharply, and these will be like enraged snakes.

Kishkindha Kanda,8,24,"""You may see your malicious and intimidating brother, someone denotative by name Vali, eradicated with these very arrows and splintered down like a mountain."" Rama said so to Sugreeva."
Kishkindha Kanda,8,25,"On hearing Raghava's words, the lord of monkey-force Sugreeva attained much happiness and said, 'good, good...'"
Kishkindha Kanda,8,26,"""Rama, I am confounded in sadness, and for those lamenting sadly you are the only recourse, and because you have befriended me I am opening up my woes before you."

Kishkindha Kanda,8,28,"""By befriending you I am able to say clearly about my internal sorrow without any hitches and hold-ups, which is always rending my heart..."" So said Sugreeva to Rama."
Kishkindha Kanda,8,29,Sugreeva said this much sentence with tears abusing his eyes and his voice is unable talk aloud since it is equally abused by tears.
Kishkindha Kanda,8,30,Sugreeva courageously controlled the sudden haste of tears that came up hastily and suddenly like a river in the presence of Rama.
Kishkindha Kanda,8,31,"He that bright Sugreeva controlled those tears, and on wiping his fortunate eyes, but sighing heavily he again started to speak this sentence to Raghava."
Kishkindha Kanda,8,32,"""Earlier he that forceful Vali deposed me from my kingdom, oh Rama, and speaking harsh words he even banished me."
Kishkindha Kanda,8,33,"""My wife who is loftier than my lives is stolen by him, and those that are my sympathisers they are also captivated and imprisoned by him."

Kishkindha Kanda,8,38,"""Rama, this is briefly my sad-story and why tell this very broadly to you as it would be too tedious... my elder brother Vali is a renowned one for his intrepidity, and he that Vali alone is my enemy."
Kishkindha Kanda,8,39,"""His end ends my distress and my later life and quietude are subjected to his destruction."
Kishkindha Kanda,8,40,"""Grief stricken such as I am, I have submitted as to how my misery ends, whether one is gladdened or saddened he has recourse only to his friend."" So said Sugreeva to Rama."
Kishkindha Kanda,8,41,"Hearing all that is spoken by Sugreeva, Rama asked, ""What for chanced the enmity? I am interested to listen, in its reality..."
Kishkindha Kanda,8,42,"""On knowing the cause of your enmity, oh, monkey, and after a proper thought, and deciding upon the strength and weakness of the cause of enmity, or of the enmity itself, I will do the needful very easily."
Kishkindha Kanda,8,43,"""On hearing that you are insulted my intense anger that can flutter my heartbeat is intensifying like the intensifying speed of waters in rainy reason."
Kishkindha Kanda,8,44,"""Be glad to say in belief, Sugreeva, before I take aim with my bow, and even before I release the arrow, and even before silencing your enemy."" Rama assured Sugreeva in this way."
Kishkindha Kanda,8,45,"Thus said by the great souled Rama, Sugreeva is very much rejoiced along with four of vanara-s available in his attendance."
Kishkindha Kanda,8,46,"Then with a pleased countenance Sugreeva started to tell Rama about the cause of the enmity, it all it truthfulness."
Kishkindha Kanda,9,1,"""Oh, great enemy destroyer Rama, my elder brother Vali is a very dear one to our father, and even for me too he was so, earlier."
Kishkindha Kanda,9,2,After the demise of our father all the ministers have glorified him immensely and made him the king of all the monkeys as he is the elder.
Kishkindha Kanda,9,3,"While he was ruling the great kingdom of my father and forefathers, I have always bowed down to him like a servant and stood by him."
Kishkindha Kanda,9,4,"There was a fierce demon named Maayaavi, the elder brother of Dundubhi and the son of one demon named Maya. There was a great enmity between this Maayaavi and Vali owing to some female."
Kishkindha Kanda,9,5,"He that Maayaavi arrived at the doors of Kishkindha in a night when the people are sleeping, and blared very much inviting Vali for a fight."
Kishkindha Kanda,9,6,"Then my brother who was also sleeping well, on hearing that bellowing in a clamouring voice, did not tolerate and came out speedily."
Kishkindha Kanda,9,7,"Though the females and myself bowed reverently to prevent Vali, he came out of palace in all his anger to kill that great demon."
Kishkindha Kanda,9,8,"But Vali spurned all of us away and forged ahead, and then I also have started to go along with Vali in all my predisposition."
Kishkindha Kanda,9,9,"A great fear was induced in that demon on seeing my brother and me too coming from a distance, and then he quickly ran away."
Kishkindha Kanda,9,10,While he is running away in fear we quickly followed him on a path that is barely lit by moonlight of the moon who is just coming up.
Kishkindha Kanda,9,11,"That demon speedily entered an un-enterable cavity under the ground, covered with grass, and we too having reached there speedily stood at the aperture of that cavity for a while."
Kishkindha Kanda,9,12,"Then Vali has gone into the enfoldment of fury on observing the entry of that demon into the hole, whereby his senses felt outraged, and he said this sentence to me."
Kishkindha Kanda,9,13,"Then Vali said to me, ""Now you stay here on the alert, Sugreeva, at the entrance of this hole till I return on destroying the enemy in a fight on my entering this hole..."""
Kishkindha Kanda,9,15,"On hearing those words I requested him to allow me too to come in to the hole, but he being the great tormentor of his enemies disallowed it, and he made me to swear on his feet and entered that hole."
Kishkindha Kanda,9,15,"Well over a year is over after his entering into that cleavage, and to me too who stayed at the entrance of the cleavage that much time had passed away."
Kishkindha Kanda,9,16,"I thought I lost him for my brother is unseen, and in all fondness towards him my mind started to doubt about some harm might have befallen on him."
Kishkindha Kanda,9,17,"After a long time blood with foam gushed out that hole, and on seeing it I was deeply saddened."
Kishkindha Kanda,9,18,"Sounds of screaming demon came to my ear, but the screeches of my brother who is involved in fight are unheard, in the least."
Kishkindha Kanda,9,19,"Oh, friend, Rama... I have surmised and concluded in mind by the indications that my brother is finished, and covered the cavity's opening with a mountain similar boulder, and performed water oblations to my deceased brother with saddening pain, and then returned to Kishkindha. But the ministers have persuaded and heard from me the actual happening though I was concealing it. [4-9-19, 20]"
Kishkindha Kanda,9,20,"Then duly summoned by all of those ministers I was crowned, and while I was ruling the kingdom judiciously, oh, Raghava, that semi-human Vali returned on killing that demoniac enemy. [4-9-21, 22a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,9,21,"But on seeing me crowned his eyes were reddened in anger, and he arrested all my ministers as he spoke rudely. [4-9-22b, 23a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,9,22,"And oh, Raghava, though I was capable enough to counter him, my reason was controlled by my esteem to brotherhood, and I was indisposed to commit that sin of defying brotherhood. [4-9-23b, 24a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,9,23,"He that brother of mine entered the capital thus on destroying the enemy, and I hailed him as usual while respecting that audacious soul, but his inner self is unsatisfied and I remained unblest. [4-9-24b, 25]"
Kishkindha Kanda,9,25,"Oh, lord Rama, though I bowed with the crown touching his feet, he that rancorous Vali showed no quarter towards me."" So said Sugreeva to Rama."
Kishkindha Kanda,10,1,"""Then desiring both of our well-being I have begged of my brother who is enveloped in anger and behaving capriciously."
Kishkindha Kanda,10,2,"""Oh, orphan's, delight Rama, I addressed him like this, ""Luckily you have eliminated the enemy and returned safely, and to an orphaned one like me you alone are the protector."
Kishkindha Kanda,10,3,"Let this regal umbrella unfolded like a full moon, with its many of its spikes, and with accompanying fur-fans may please be accepted while I hold it for you."
Kishkindha Kanda,10,4,"""Saddened I was after staying at the entrance of the cave for one year, oh, king, and on seeing the blood that started to flow from out the cave in the entrance my heart is engulfed in sadness and my senses perturbed very much, and then covering that cave's entrance with a hilltop, and departing from that country, I re-entered Kishkindha. [4-10-4, 5, 6a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,10,5,"""On seeing me returning with grief, the citizens and ministers alike crowned me, but that is not at my desire, therefore it is apt of you pardon me. [4-10-6b, 7a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,10,6,"""As an estimable one you alone are the king, and I will be as I was, and establishing me in kingship is owing to your unavailability, but the capital with citizens and ministers is kept up without thorniness. [4-10-7b, 8]"
Kishkindha Kanda,10,9,"""Oh, gentle one, I am now returning this custodial kingdom to you, oh, enemy eliminator, you need not be hostile towards me."
Kishkindha Kanda,10,8,"""I beg you with my bowed head and with my prayerful palm-fold, the ministers and the city dwellers have collectively and forcibly nominated me to the kingship, only to keep the kingless kingdom under control. [4-10-10, 11a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,10,9,"""While I was speaking that politely he threatened me and indeed used many expletives starting from 'fie, fie, upon you.' and the like. [4-10-11b, 12a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,10,10,"""And summoning people and venerable ministers he hurled very abusive words at me among friends. [4-10-12b, 13a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,10,11,"""You all are aware that earlier the gigantic and rancorous demon Maayaavi invited me desiring a duel in that night. [4-10-13b, 14a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,10,12,"""On hearing his call for a duel I went out of the royal palace, and this very hazardous brother of mine quickly followed me. [4-10-14b, 15a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,10,13,"""And that formidable demon Maayaavi ran away as he was fraught with fear on seeing me with a second one at my side, and he speedily entered a great cavity of earth on seeing us two nearly reaching him. [4-10-15b, 16]"
Kishkindha Kanda,10,17,"""On knowing the demon's entry into that great precarious cavity, I said to this one, this cruel looking brother of mine."
Kishkindha Kanda,10,18,"""My power will not let me return from here to the capital without killing that demon, hence you wait at this cavity's entrance, till I kill that demon and come out of the cavity."
Kishkindha Kanda,10,19,"""Believing that he stayed at the entrance of the cavity I entered that impenetrable cavity, and then in searching for that demon there one year elapsed."
Kishkindha Kanda,10,20,"""I have seen that terrified enemy of mine effortlessly, and I killed him immediately along with all of his relatives."
Kishkindha Kanda,10,21,"""That cavity has become impassable, since it is fully filled with the gushes of blood emanating from the mouth of that demon who fell yelling onto ground."
Kishkindha Kanda,10,22,"""On my killing that invading enemy easily, I could not see any exit from that cavity as its mouth was closed."
Kishkindha Kanda,10,23,"""Wherefore I did not get a reply though I repeatedly shouted, 'Sugreeva, oh, Sugreeva.' thereby I was very saddened."
Kishkindha Kanda,10,24,"""With my foot I pounded and smashed that lidded hilltop, and from there I exited that way and arrived here."
Kishkindha Kanda,10,25,"""As such this cruel fantasist of kingdom trammelled me in there forgetting the clannishness."" So said Vali to all the courtiers."
Kishkindha Kanda,10,26,"""On saying thus that monkey ruthlessly banished me, then and there in the court itself, who am with a single clothing on my body."
Kishkindha Kanda,10,27,"""Thus he threw me away and even stole my wife, oh, Rama, and owing to his fear alone I roamed all over the earth with its forests and oceans."
Kishkindha Kanda,10,28,"""I who am saddened by stealing my wife have entered this safest mountain Rishyamuka, which is impenetrable for Vali by another reason."
Kishkindha Kanda,10,29,"""All this notable account of enmity is reported to you, oh, Raghava, and you may examine the dire straits befallen on me at no fault of mine."
Kishkindha Kanda,10,30,"""Oh, Rama, the fear-remover of all the worlds, it is apt of you to bestow me invulnerability from the fear of Vali, and oh, valiant one, as well as to rein him in."" Sugreeva requested Rama thus."
Kishkindha Kanda,10,31,"When he is requested thus by Sugreeva, that virtuous and resplendent Rama started to tell Sugreeva, the words that abide by virtue, as though trivializing the task on hand."
Kishkindha Kanda,10,32,"""Admirable and sun-like burners are these arrows of mine that are now mingled with my wrath, and they are bound fall on that evil minded Vali."
Kishkindha Kanda,10,33,"""He that stealer of your wife, that evil-minded abuser of history lives as long as I descry."
Kishkindha Kanda,10,34,"""By my experience I see how you are deluged in a sea of sadness, but I will make you to get over that sea, and you will definitely regain abundantly whatever you lost."" Rama assured Sugreeva thus."
Kishkindha Kanda,10,35,"Hearing that sentence of Rama, which is enhancing happiness and self-esteem, Sugreeva is very gladdened and further said this great sentence."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,1,Sugreeva started to adore and extol Raghava on hearing the words of Rama that are inculcating happiness and pride.
Kishkindha Kanda,11,2,"""It is doubtless that you will burn down everything when you are angry, like the blazing sun at the end of era, with these arrows of yours that are highly blazing, incisive and invaders on stealthy places."" Thus Sugreeva started extolling Rama."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,3,"""That which is impetuousness of Vali, that which is his bravery and courageousness are there, they may be listened from me single-mindedly, and later you impose that which need be imposed."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,4,"""Before the dawn of sun Vali unweariedly strides from western ocean to eastern, and even from southern to northern for offering water oblations to the rising sun."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,5,"""Ascending the heights of mountains and even rending their greatest peaks, that mighty one volleys them upwards and in turn catches them, as though they are play balls."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,6,"""As a show his strength Vali used to personally fell many sturdy trees of diverse origin by his might."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,7,"""One named Dundubhi was there in the form of a buffalo, whose size shone forth like Mt. Kailash and who bears the strength of a thousand elephants."" Thus Sugreeva started telling Dundubhi's episode to Rama."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,8,"""He that evil-minded and colossal bodied Dundubhi was bemused by the vanity of his own vigour, and by the boon bestowed oo him, and once he went to the lord of rivers, namely the Ocean."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,9,"""Deriding the garner of weaves and gems he said to that vastly ocean ""give me a fight"""
Kishkindha Kanda,11,10,"""Then, oh, Rama, that virtue-minded and very powerful ocean rose up from his tabular position to heights, and spoke these words to that demon Dundubhi who is driven to doom by his own time."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,11,"""I am not capable to give you a fight, oh, war-expert, but I will name him who can give you a fight, listen."" So said ocean to the demon."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,12,"""A sublime shelter for sages and the father-in-law of Shankara is there in great forests, well-know by the name Himavan, the king of mountains, and he embodies great cascades, cataracts, and caves, and he alone is capable to accord a matchless happiness to you in the form of a fight."" So said ocean to Dundubhi. [4-11-12, 13]"
Kishkindha Kanda,11,13,"""Fathoming that ocean to be scared of him that noted demon Dundubhi arrived at the forests of Himavan like an arrow darted from bow, and that Dundubhi started to blare discordantly and toss the rock-faces of that mountain that are like white elephants in their figuration, severally. [4-11-14, 15]"
Kishkindha Kanda,11,16,"""Then he who is like a silver cloud in his figuration, a gentle and delightful one in his appearance, that Himavan spoke these words to the demon staying on his own cliff."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,17,"""It is inapt of you to annoy me, oh, virtuous Dundubhi, I am just a shelterer of sages, and an unskilled one in fights."" So said Himavan to Dundubhi."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,18,"""On hearing the words of that modest king of mountains Dundubhi's uyes are bloodshot and he said this sentence."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,19,"""Whether you are incapable to fight with me, or not venturing me as you are scared of me is not my concern, but tell me who can really give me a very combative fight,."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,20,"On hearing Dundubhi's arrogant words that honest Himavan being an expert in sentence-making, had to say angry words to that fierce demon that were never uttered by him earlier."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,21,"""Oh, war-expert Dundubhi, Indra's son is there, a brave and glorious one by name Vali, and he is now presiding over the matchlessly pompous city Kishkindha."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,22,"""He is a highly intelligent one and a war-expert too, and he is the capable one to give you a duel, like Indra to Namuchi."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,23,"""Approach him promptly if you desire a fight now, and he is an intrepid one who will always be in the manoeuvres of war, and indeed none can assail him."" Thus said Himavan to that demon Dundubhi."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,24,"""Then on hearing Himavan's words he that Dundubhi is convulsed in anger and proceeded to Vali's city Kishkindha.."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,23,"""That great mighty demon Dundubhi wearing the look of a buffalo with sharp horns was awe-inspiring, and like the arrival of a massive dark cloud in rainy season full with water on the edge of firmament, he arrived at the gateway of Kishkindha and bellowed clamorously like a war-drum as though to quake the earth. [4-11-25, 26]"
Kishkindha Kanda,11,27,"""He bellowed uprooting trees that are rooted nearby, scooping the earth with hooves, and insolently goring the gateway with horns like a goring elephant."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,28,"""Vali who by then went into his palace chambers became intolerant to hear that noise and fell out from there along with ladies, like the moon with stars."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,29,"""Vali being the lord of monkeys, and of all the other forest-dwellers as well, spoke a clearly worded brief sentence to Dundubhi."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,30,"""Oh, Dundubhi, impeding the gateway of this city what for you are bellowing, I know you, oh, might one, save your lives."" Vali cautioned that demon that way."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,31,"""On hearing that sentence of Vali, the tactful lord of monkeys, Dundubhi said this sentence with his eyes bloodshot in anger."" Thus Sugreeva continued his narration to Rama."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,32,"""It is inapt of you to speak words in the vicinity of ladies, oh, valiant Vali, give me a duel now and then I can appreciate your might."""
Kishkindha Kanda,11,33,"""Otherwise I bear up my rage for this night, oh, monkey, you may unrestrainedly delight yourself till morning in your voluptuous gratifications, for you are now surrounded by your ladies."""
Kishkindha Kanda,11,34,"""Also embrace all the monkeys and bequeath endowments to them, and you may bid adieu to all the good-hearted people of yours for you are the king of all the tree-branch animals, as you may not see them later."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,35,"""Let Kishkindha city be seen clearly by you as last sight, and keep someone equalling you as in charge of city, and also rejoice with the females till sunrise as there is no tomorrow to you."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,36,"""He who kills a drunken one, unvigilant one, defeated one, or one without weapons, or an atrophied one, he get the sin of foeticide in the world, and your present state is suchlike."" Dundubhi incited Vali in this way."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,37,"""Then Vali laughed that demon off, discharged all the females namely Tara and others, and then he spoke to that stupid lord of demons in anger."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,38,"""Don't surmise that I am drunk, and should you be unafraid of a fight, regard this drunkenness of mine as the toast of a gallant fighter in this deadly fight."" Vali said so to Dundubhi."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,39,"""Saying that way to that Dundubhi that highly enraged Vali heaved up the golden chest-pendant around his neck on to his chest, which was given by his father Mahendra, and stood firm for fight."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,40,"""Then that elephantine monkey Vali took that mountain-similar Dundubhi by horns, and booming highly he whirled and bumped him onto ground."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,41,"""Vali while blaring highly with great sound repeatedly whirled him and thrown onto ground, and while Dundubhi was hurled and thrown to ground, blood gushed out of his two ears."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,42,"""There occurred a gruesome fight among those two, Dundubhi and Vali, who by their fury are impetuous and who aspired victory over the other."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,43,"""Then Vali who is similar to Indra in his fortitude fought with him with his fists, knees and feet, and like that with boulders and trees."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,44,"""While each is assaulting the other in that fight between that monkey and demon, that demon is impaired and Indra's son Vali toughened."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,45,"""In that life-taking fight when Dundubhi is lifted up and flung to ground, he is completely pounded out."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,46,"""While he is felled down much blood is flown out from the vent-holes of his body, nine of them, ears, nose, eyes etc., and on his falling that mighty one Dundubhi attained the fifth-state."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,47,"""Then the hastiest Vali swayed that dead and inanimate demon with both of his hands and hurled him a yojana distance in a single flick."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,48,"""And while he is thrown that hastily blood drops oozed from his mouth, and flung by air they fell in the hermitage of sage Matanga."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,49,"""On seeing the blood drops fallen there, oh Rama, that sage is enraged and thought, 'who is he indeed, who dropped the blood...' Thus Sugreeva narrated to Rama."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,50,""" 'By which evil-spirited one I am abruptly touched with blood? Who is that evil-minded one? Who is that malevolent, disobedient and a reckless one?' Thus the sage Matanga pondered."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,51,"""Thinking thus and coming out of hermitage that celebrated sage has seen the mountainous buffalo fallen on ground lifelessly."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,52,"""On knowing by his ascetic power that this deed is done by the monkey, he released a great curse on him who tossed the cadaver of buffalo."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,53,"""Untreadable is this sheltering wood of mine to him who has stained it with squirts of blood, and if he enters this place peradventure, fatality occurs on him."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,51,"""By his hurling the demon's body these trees are also completely destroyed, hence he ought not set his foot in a distance of one full yojana around this hermitage, and if that evil-minded one places his foot then he evidently does not exist. [4-11-54, 55a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,11,52,"""And some of his friends that are dependent on my woods shall not live here and they may depart on hearing my words and solace themselves with my words. [4-11-55b, 56a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,11,57,"""This forest of mine is always protected like my own son, and if the monkeys of Vali wish to stay behind in this forest alone for further destruction of leaves or sprouts, or even for the non-existence of fruits and tubers of this forest, defiantly they too will be cursed."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,58,"""And today is the day of limit and the monkey whom I will see tomorrow, he will be petrified for many thousand years to come."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,59,"""Then those monkeys on hearing the clear wording of the sage started out from that forest, and on their coming to Kishkindha, Vali saw them and spoke this way to them."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,60,""" 'Why all of you dwellers of Matanga forest arrived in my presence, even so, are you the dwellers of that forest safe?' Thus Vali asked all."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,61,"""Then all of those monkeys have reported to Vali, the one with a golden chest-pendant, all the reasons for their exit, likewise the curse to Vali."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,62,"""Then on hearing all those words narrated by monkeys Vali approached that great sage and begged of him on becoming humble with palm-fold."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,63,"""The sage inconsiderate of Vali's request withdrew into hermitage, and fearing to bear the brunt of the curse Vali was distraught and withdrew from that place."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,64,"""Then, dreaded by the fear of curse that monkey Vali does not aspire to enter the great mountain Rishyamuka, oh, people's lord, Rama, or he does not even wish to look at it."" Thus Sugreeva continued his narration."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,65,"""Knowing the inaccessibility of this forest to him I got rid of my agony, Rama, and I move here about in this great forest along with my ministers."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,66,"""This huge heap of bones that is shining forth like a mountaintop is that of Dundubhi, which Vali once hurled by the vanity of his valour."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,67,"""Also these are the seven enormous sala trees full with their branches, and Vali is capable to make each of them leafless by his vigour, of course, one at a time."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,68,"""Oh, Rama, I am apprising all this to tell about the unequalled vitality of Vali, and oh, king, then how is it possible for you to eliminate Vali in war."" Thus Sugreeva enquired with Rama."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,69,"When Sugreeva spoke that way Lakshmana a little smiled and asked him, ""On performing which act do you confide in the possibility of Vali's elimination?"""
Kishkindha Kanda,11,70,"Then Sugreeva said to Lakshmana, ""earlier Vali used to agitate each of the trees, one after the other, on many occasions."""
Kishkindha Kanda,11,71,"""If Rama can rend one tree out of the seven with only one arrow, then on seeing Rama's valour I can construe that Vali is utterly dead at his hand."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,72,"""Lakshmana, if he lifts and kicks the skeleton of this dead buffalo by the might of his foot, and makes it fall at a distance of two hundred bow-lengths, I can confide."" So said Sugreeva to Lakshmana."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,73,"Sugreeva paused for a while on saying thus to Rama, for Rama's eye-corners are reddened with anger towards Vali, and then Sugreeva again spoke to Rama."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,74,"""Vali is a mighty monkey, an intrepid one, who esteems his own intrepidity, and one who is well renowned by his might and tenacity, and in combats he is an undefeated one."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,75,"""His deeds that are impracticable even for gods are obvious, and scared for recollecting them I took shelter of Mt. Rishyamuka."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,76,"""Concluding that the lord of monkeys Vali to be an unconquerable, unattackable, unsympathetic one I am not leaving this Mt. Rishyamuka."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,77,"""I am moving about these forests along with earnest ministers like Hanuma and other significant ones, only because I am disconcerted and sceptical of him."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,78,"""I chanced upon a laudable and true friend in you, oh, Rama, the patron of friends, hence I take shelter in you, oh, tigerly man, for you are the final resort for those seeking salvation, like Mt. Himavan."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,79,"""I know the might of that mighty brother-the-malice of mine, and oh, Raghava, but your valour in combat is imprecise to me."""
Kishkindha Kanda,11,80,"""Definitely I am neither examining, nor demeaning, nor intimidating you, but his macabre exploits caused cowardice in me."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,81,"""It is definite, oh, Raghava, your word, courage, and physique denote some sublime radiance in you, as with ash covered fire."" So said Sugreeva to Rama."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,82,"On hearing that word of great-souled Sugreeva, Rama smilingly replied that monkey in his turn."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,83,"""If you are unable to confide in the intrepidity of ours, oh, monkey, I shall ingrain commendable confidence in you with respect to our action."" Thus Rama said to Sugreeva."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,80,"Saying so to Sugreeva in a comforting manner, he that dextrous, vigorous Rama, the elder brother of Lakshmana sportively flipped the skeleton of Dundubhi with his big toe, and flicked that withered body of the demon with his big toe itself to a ten yojana distance without lifting his foot. [4-11-84, 85]"
Kishkindha Kanda,11,86,"Then on seeing at the hurled body, and at valiant Rama who by now is like the blazing sun, again Sugreeva said this meaningful word to Rama in the presence of Lakshmana and other monkeys."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,87,"""Oh, friend, at that time when my tired and tipsy brother Vali tossed this body it was unspoilt, wet with blood and full with flesh."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,88,"""Raghava, now this body is sleazy, without flesh, also rendered into a strawy condition, and oh, Raghu's delight, you too flipped it because you are now energetic."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,89,"""If it be said something is wet or dried up there chances a lot of difference, oh, Raghava, thereby it may not be possible to assess whether you might is greater or his, as the gravity of the case depends much on that wetness or dryness alone, isn't it."""
Kishkindha Kanda,11,90,"""That alone is the uncertainty in that matter, sire, whether your strength is superior or his, and if a single sala tree is ripped in an outright manner the ability or otherwise will be evident."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,91,"""String the bowstring to this bow of yours, an alternate of elephant's trunk, and stretch it out up to your ear, and release a great arrow."
Kishkindha Kanda,11,92,"""Darted by you your arrow will rip off this sala tree, oh, king, there is no doubt in that matter, enough is this thinking of yours and you will definitely do me this favour, I pray and swear upon me."""
Kishkindha Kanda,11,93,"""As to how the sun is unsurpassed among all brilliances, as to how Himavan is unmatched among all mountains, as to how the lion is unequalled among all quadrupeds, so you are among all men for your unique valour."" So said Sugreeva to Rama."
Kishkindha Kanda,12,1,"On hearing the well-spoken words of Sugreeva that expressed doubt about Rama's valour, that great resplendent Rama took-up bow to inculcate credence in Sugreeva."
Kishkindha Kanda,12,2,"Rama, the bestower of dignity to the sufferers, took up his dreadful bow, aimed at a sala tree, and darted single arrow, by which all the directions reverberated with the twang of his bowstring."
Kishkindha Kanda,12,3,"The golden arrow released by the mighty Rama perforated all the seven sala trees, and even the levelled areas of mountain, and then entered the earth."
Kishkindha Kanda,12,4,"Thus that arrow which briskly drilled all the sala trees, came up in a moment from under the earth, and again swiftly re-entered the quiver of Rama."
Kishkindha Kanda,12,5,"On seeing them the seven sala trees that are profoundly fissured, that best monkey Sugreeva went into a stunning astonishment at the rapidity of Rama's arrow."
Kishkindha Kanda,12,6,"Highly gladdened Sugreeva made palm-fold in that astonishment, kneeled while his ornaments dangled, and prostrated before Raghava with his head touching the ground."
Kishkindha Kanda,12,7,"Overjoyed with that deed Sugreeva said this to that virtue-knower, the one who is proficient among all experts of missiles, namely the valorous Rama, who is just in his presence him."
Kishkindha Kanda,12,8,"""You with your arrows, oh, best one among men, are capable of eliminating all the gods including Indra, oh, lord, then why to speak of Vali."
Kishkindha Kanda,12,9,"""By whom seven great sala trees, a mountain and also the earth is ripped off with only one arrow, oh Kakutstha, who then can stand up to you in the vanguard of war."
Kishkindha Kanda,12,10,"""Today on gaining a kind-hearted friend like you, who is similar to Indra and Rain-god who accord favour on their own, my distress is gone and my joy is heightened."
Kishkindha Kanda,12,11,"""Oh, Rama, today itself you eliminate that enemy of mine in a brother's semblance for my happiness, for which I adjoin my palms in supplication."" Thus Sugreeva requested Rama."
Kishkindha Kanda,12,12,"That great percipient Rama embraced Sugreeva, which Sugreeva is pleasant in his look for he gained confidence by now, and who is an alternate of Lakshmana to partake Rama's affection, and then Rama said these words to such a Sugreeva in reply."
Kishkindha Kanda,12,13,"""""Let us quickly go from here to Kishkindha, oh, Sugreeva, you move in advance, and on going there you invite that Vali, one redolent of your brotherhood."" So said Rama to Sugreeva."
Kishkindha Kanda,12,14,"They all on quickly going to Kishkindha, the city of Vali, hedged themselves in the thickets of forest trees and waited."
Kishkindha Kanda,12,15,"Sugreeva firmly tightened his girdle-cloth for the duel and shouted boisterously for the purpose of inviting Vali for a duel, and his rapidity in shouting appeared as though to crack the sky."
Kishkindha Kanda,12,16,"On hearing his brother's shouting that great mighty Vali is infuriated and impetuously rushed out of his palace chambers, like the sun falling back onto sky from his dusking brink."
Kishkindha Kanda,12,17,"Then a very tumultuous and awful fight occurred between Vali and Sugreeva, which is like the awful fight between the planets Mercury and Mars in skies."
Kishkindha Kanda,12,18,"Those two brothers who are convulsed in frenzy battered each other in that fight with their thunderbolt-like palms, and lightning-like fists."
Kishkindha Kanda,12,19,"Then Rama wielding bow in his hand watched those valiant ones that are alike in their appearance, like the Ashwin twins among gods."
Kishkindha Kanda,12,20,"For which reason Raghava could not differentiate between Sugreeva or Vali, for the same reason did not make up his mind to release his arrow, otherwise it would have been a deadening arrow, as confusion is the only reason for Rama."
Kishkindha Kanda,12,21,"Meanwhile Sugreeva is unable to spot out his benefactor Raghava as Vali whacked him down, and thereby he immediately fled to Mt. Rishyamuka."
Kishkindha Kanda,12,22,"Sugreeva is debilitated and enervated by Vali's thwacking till his limbs soaked in blood, and he entered the great forest of Rishyamuka as Vali chased him."
Kishkindha Kanda,12,23,"On seeing Sugreeva's entry into the forest of Rishyamuka, Vali said to him ""you are let off for now..."" and saying so he returned to Kishkindha from there in view of fear from curse of Sage Matanga."
Kishkindha Kanda,12,24,"Raghava also came to that forest, along with his brother Lakshmana and along with Hanuma, where that monkey Sugreeva fled."
Kishkindha Kanda,12,25,"Seeing the arrival of Rama with Lakshmana, Sugreeva ashamedly turned his eyes down to earth and piteously spoke this without eyeing Rama"
Kishkindha Kanda,12,26,"""Showing your dexterity you encouraged me to invite Vali for fight, but you got me battered by my enemy, what is this done by you."""
Kishkindha Kanda,12,27,"""You should have truly made it known at that time only, oh, Raghava, that you will not kill Vali, then I would not have come here, to Kishkindha."
Kishkindha Kanda,12,28,Rama replied that great-souled Sugreeva who is speaking woefully with pathetic words in this way.
Kishkindha Kanda,12,29,"""Sugreeva, by which reason I have not let-off an arrow such as that of mine, that reason may be heard and let the anger be discarded."
Kishkindha Kanda,12,30,"""By ornamentation, attire, physicality and movements, you and Vali look-alike."
Kishkindha Kanda,12,31,"""By your voice, bodily glow also thus in your looking, also in bravery and in speech, oh monkey, I could not mark any difference."
Kishkindha Kanda,12,32,"""Thereby, oh, great monkey, I have not released this great speeded and enemy annihilating arrow of mine as I was confused in the similarity of your personalities."
Kishkindha Kanda,12,33,"""I was ambiguous by your similarities, as such I have not released this ghastly and life-taking arrow, otherwise the basic object of ours will be ruined, isn't it."
Kishkindha Kanda,12,34,"""When my unawareness and fallacy hazardously afflicts none but you in the form of my own arrow, oh, brave lord of monkeys, then I will be establishing my own imbecility and naivety, isn't it."
Kishkindha Kanda,12,35,"""Eliminating one who is protected means a terrifying sin of highest order, even so, myself and Lakshmana and also thus Seetha with her exquisite glow are all dependent on you, and you are our shelterer in this forest. [4-12-35, 36a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,12,36,"""Therefore, oh, monkey, again you fight with him without doubting me, and I will render him ineffective at this moment only with a single arrow of mine, and you can see Vali squirming on the ground. [4-12-36, 37],"
Kishkindha Kanda,12,38,"""You have an identification for yourself, oh lord of monkeys, by which you can be identified when you are engaged in duel."
Kishkindha Kanda,12,39,"""Lakshmana, pick up this gaja creeper that is beautiful in its appearance and let this noble souled Sugreeva be garlanded with that."" So said Rama to Lakshmana."
Kishkindha Kanda,12,40,"Then Lakshmana plucked that gaja creeper with flowers growing at the foot of the mountain, and slung it like a garland around the neck of that Sugreeva."
Kishkindha Kanda,12,41,"He that prosperous Sugreeva with that flowery-creeper adorning his neck then shone forth like a black rain cloud against a backdrop of rich ochry colour of sunset, and with a train of herons adorning that cloud like a garland."
Kishkindha Kanda,12,42,"He that Sugreeva whose physique became effulgent by that creeper-garland is again emboldened by Rama's words, and he again advanced to Kishkindha with Rama, and reached it again."
Kishkindha Kanda,13,1,"That righteous Rama readying his great bow decorated with gold, and on taking blazing sun similar arrows that are victory-oriented in wars, proceeded from Rishyamuka along with Sugreeva to the city ruled by the valour of Vali, namely Kishkindha. [4-13-1, 2]"
Kishkindha Kanda,13,3,Stern-necked Sugreeva and the great mighty Lakshmana strode ahead of that great soul Rama.
Kishkindha Kanda,13,4,"The brave Hanuma, dauntless Nala and Neela, and the captain of monkey's captains Tara of great energy followed them rearward."
Kishkindha Kanda,13,5,"They moved on looking at the trees that are drooping with the weight of their flowers, and at he rivers that are carrying pleasant water while themselves are coursing towards ocean."
Kishkindha Kanda,13,6,"They on seeing house-like caverns, crags, ravines and caves, and monumental peaks, cavities that are pleasant for sight have moved on."
Kishkindha Kanda,13,7,"On their way they observed lakes that are glistening forth with gem-like waters without slime, and with lotus buds in budding stage."
Kishkindha Kanda,13,8,"Those lakes are reverberant with Karandava-s, Saarasa-s, Swans, Vanjula-s and other waterfowls, also like that with Chakravaaka-s and other birds."
Kishkindha Kanda,13,9,"They have seen fearless deer feeding on soft grass blades everywhere, somewhere moving here and there in the forest, and else where standing."
Kishkindha Kanda,13,10,"They have also seen the forest elephants that have white tusks for their ornaments and that are moving in herds, and which are the dangerous enemies of lakes as they destroy lakebeds."
Kishkindha Kanda,13,11,"Also seen are the vigorous and elephantine monkeys that are like mobile mountains, begrimed with dust, and bellowing on mountain ridges."
Kishkindha Kanda,13,12,"On seeing other forest beings in that forest and birds moving aloft in sky, those followers of Sugreeva quickly moved on."
Kishkindha Kanda,13,13,"While they are quickly going, Rama, the delight of Raghu's dynasty, saw there a clump of forest trees and he asked Sugreeva like this."
Kishkindha Kanda,13,14,"""This cluster of trees surrounded with plantain trees is like an accumulation of thick clouds, and this is shining forth like a cloudscape in sky."
Kishkindha Kanda,13,15,"""What is this? I wish to know and oh, friend, I wish you to clear this inquisitiveness of mine."
Kishkindha Kanda,13,16,"On hearing that sentence of that great soul Raghava, then Sugreeva described about the significance of that forest while proceeding on the way."
Kishkindha Kanda,13,17,"""Raghava, this spacious hermitage with abundant gardens and dainty tubers, fruits and water is a weary remover."" Thus Sugreeva started telling Rama."
Kishkindha Kanda,13,18,"""There were hermits named sapta jana, Seven Persons, who were dourly vowed with their heads pendulous downward and legs up, as in shiirSa aasana , the upside-down yogic body posture, and who always reclined in water."
Kishkindha Kanda,13,19,"""They were making diet on air alone that too once in seven days, and living unwaveringly in that way they practised their asceticism for seven hundred years and went to heavens with their bodies."
Kishkindha Kanda,13,20,"""This hermitage that has encircling trees for its compound wall has become highly unassailable even for Indra together with all gods and demons."
Kishkindha Kanda,13,21,"""Birds and other forest moving animals forbear this hermitage and those that unknowingly enter in there they do not return."
Kishkindha Kanda,13,22,"""From there artistically worded lyrical and instrumental tunes, and even the sounds of ornaments are audible, and oh, Raghava, one can sense a divine fragrance too."
Kishkindha Kanda,13,23,"""Even the triadic ritual-fires glow there, and their thick and ochry coloured smoke like that of a reddish-brown pigeon is apparent muffling the treetops."
Kishkindha Kanda,13,24,"""When that smoke is mantling their tops these trees are beaming forth like mountains of gems overlaid with clusters of clouds."
Kishkindha Kanda,13,25,"""Offer salutations determinedly and adjoining palms addressing the sages called Seven Persons, oh Raghava, along with brother Lakshmana"
Kishkindha Kanda,13,26,"""Those that offer salutations to those sages with contemplated souls will evince no bodily trauma in the least."" Thus said Sugreeva to Rama."
Kishkindha Kanda,13,27,"Then Rama along with brother Lakshmana adjoined palms, addressed himself to the great-souled sages known as Seven Persons, and offered salutations to them."
Kishkindha Kanda,13,28,"That righteous Rama along with brother Lakshmana, Sugreeva and other monkeys having worshipped those sages proceeded to Kishkindha well-pleased at heart."
Kishkindha Kanda,13,29,Having gone a long way from that hermitage of Seven Persons they have seen that unassailable and Vali ruled city namely Kishkindha.
Kishkindha Kanda,13,30,"Then Rama's bother Lakshmana, Rama, and other monkeys wielding their weapons and flaring with their upsurged fiery again came to eliminate that enemy Vali to the city that is ruled by the brawn of the same Vali, the son of Indra."
Kishkindha Kanda,14,1,"They all on quickly going to Kishkindha, the city of Vali, hedged themselves in the thickets of forest trees and waited."
Kishkindha Kanda,14,2,That forest lover with tumultuous voice Sugreeva cast his eye everywhere and assumed tremendous fury.
Kishkindha Kanda,14,3,"Then Sugreeva encompassed by his followers war-whooped ghastlily, like a great cloud that emerged accelerated by gusty wind and that is thundering as though to rip the sky, inviting Vali for fight."
Kishkindha Kanda,14,4,"Then Sugreeva who is like the rising sun and whose stride is like that of a proud lion saw the adroit Rama and then said this sentence. [4-14-4b, 5a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,14,5,""" She whose arch-way is decorated in gold, who is spread out with snares of monkeys, and who is impregnated with flags and machinery, we arrived at such city of Vali, Kishkindha. [4-14-5b, 6a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,14,6,"""Oh Brave one, you make happen the promise you earlier made regarding the elimination of Vali on time, like the time of sprouting that enables a creeper-plant to bear a sprout on time. [4-14-6b, 7a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,14,7,"When thus said by Sugreeva that enemy-destroyer and righteous Raghava said this word Sugreeva. [4-14-7b, 8a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,14,8,"""By which creeper-garland that Lakshmana plucked out and garlanded you, by this creeper-garland of gaja-flowers alone your identification is marked. [4-14-8b, 9a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,14,9,"""Oh brave-one, you are shining forth with this creeper-garland laced at your neck like the night time sun with a garland of stars. [4-14-9b, 10a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,14,10,"""Oh Vanara, today itself I will set you free from the fear and enmity whipped up by Vali by releasing a single arrow in fight. [4-14-10b, 11a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,14,11,"""You show me your enemy in a brother's mien, oh, monkey, by then he will be rolling in the dust of this forest eliminated by me. [4-14-11b, 12a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,14,12,"""If he returns to live even after my espying him then immediately you can find fault with me, you can even deride me. [4-14-12b, 13a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,14,13,"""Seven saala trees are rived with a single of arrow of mine in your presence, thereby be sure that Vali will be dispatched now, by my might. [4-14-13b, 14a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,14,14,"""Just bound by the anxiousness to implement righteousness untruth is unsaid by me earlier though I am involved in distresses for a long time, and hereafter it will not be said in anywise. [4-14-14b, 15a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,14,15,"""As Indra fructifies the sprouted paddy field I will make happen my promise, hence leave off your perplexity."" [4-14-15b, 16a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,14,16,"""Thereby to invite that Vali with golden pendant, oh, Sugreeva, you make such a war-cry by which that monkey Vali comes out. [4-14-16b, 17a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,14,17,"""Vali is a willing fighter who shines forth by his victories and one who is given ovation for his triumphs, and undefeated by you as yet, such as he is he may be incited with war-whoop so that he comes out without any hindrance. [4-14-17b, 18a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,14,18,"""One who is assertive of his own valour will not tolerate to hear enemy's daring in a brawl, that too in the presence of ladies."" So said Rama to Sugreeva. [4-14-18b, 19a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,14,19,"On hearing the words of Rama he that Sugreeva with golden yellow complexion blared a gruesome blare as though to completely rend the sky. [4-14-19b, 20a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,14,20,"By that sound of Sugreeva the splendour of cows is marred and they are running helter-skelter like the well-born ladies who are mishandled by invaders due to the misrule of their own king. [4-14-20b, 21a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,14,21,"And deer are hurriedly fleeing like war worsted horses, and the sky-flying birds are falling to ground like planets or stars when their merit diminishes. [4-14-21b, c]"
Kishkindha Kanda,14,22,"Sugreeva, the son of Sun, who is well-known for cloud like thundering, and whose vigour is now reinforced by his bravery, then promptly released an oceanic roar like an ocean with splashing waves drifted by gales."
Kishkindha Kanda,15,1,Then the illiberal Vali has clearly heard that outcry of his plain-spoken brother Sugreeva from his palace chambers.
Kishkindha Kanda,15,2,On hearing Sugreeva's outcry that is shuddering all beings Vali's insolence is diminished as high furore superimposed on it.
Kishkindha Kanda,15,3,"Then, embitterment overspreading on all his limbs Vali with golden-hue is immediately rendered non-luminous like the eclipsed sun."
Kishkindha Kanda,15,4,With asymmetrical teeth and with burning fireball like eyes Vali is reflective of a lake whose red-lotuses are uprooted leaving stalks afloat.
Kishkindha Kanda,15,5,That monkey Vali then on hearing that intolerable noise bolted out of palace chambers thumping his feet as though to shatter the earth.
Kishkindha Kanda,15,6,"His wife Tara stepped in and showing goodwill and amity hugged him, for she is in fear and bewilderment, and said this word that is beneficial in its futurity if Vali heeds it."
Kishkindha Kanda,15,7,"""Oh brave one, you better gently leave off this anger that is coming on like a gushing river as is done with an enjoyed chaplet on getting up from bed in early hours."
Kishkindha Kanda,15,8,"""Oh, monkey, you can fight with him in early hours of tomorrow, oh, brave one, evidently you neither have divers enemies nor your valour is trivialised."""
Kishkindha Kanda,15,8,"""You can fight with him at appropriate time, thereby your enemy is neither glorified nor you are trivialised evidently, for you are a braving one."
Kishkindha Kanda,15,9,"""Your quick exiting is disagreeable for me, and what for you are dissuaded that may be listened as I tell."
Kishkindha Kanda,15,10,"""Earlier Sugreeva came assaulting and inviting you for a combat, and you also have gone out and rendered him as a nonentity, and being battered by you he fled in all directions."
Kishkindha Kanda,15,11,"""He who is undone earlier by you, particularly after torturing by you, his coming here again and inviting you for a duel is causing a doubt in me."
Kishkindha Kanda,15,12,"""The arrogance and endeavour of the shouter, and even the rampage of his furore, all these will not have a trivial reason, isn't it."
Kishkindha Kanda,15,13,"""I do not think that Sugreeva has come here unaccompanied, and on whom he is dependant must be an unflinching support foregathered by Sugreeva."
Kishkindha Kanda,15,14,"""By his nature Sugreeva is an expert and even so a clever one, and he does not enter into friendship with anyone without examining his mettle."
Kishkindha Kanda,15,15,"""I am already briefed by our son Angada's information, and what I have heard I will now relate that helpful word to you."
Kishkindha Kanda,15,16,"""Son Angada said this account when he returned from forests, and to him spies are said to have reported this."
Kishkindha Kanda,15,18,"""Those that are born in Ikshvaku dynasty, sons of the king of Ayodhya, valiant and unconquerable ones in war, called Rama and Lakshmana are there in this country. These two unassailable ones have chanced there at Sugreeva's place to fulfil the longing desire of Sugreeva. [4-15-17, 18a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,15,19,"""He is an acclaimed one for his warfare, and like the fire flaring up at the end of era he shatters the strength of enemies, and he is Rama your brother's helpmate, they say so. [4-15-18b, 19a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,15,20,"""And he is said to the habitable tree for the polite, the ultimate course for the woebegone, a hospice for the agonised, and for grace Rama is the only abode. [4-15-19b, 20a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,15,21,"""He is endowed with the knowledge of mundane and ultra-mundane things, he always abides in the directives of his father, and as with Mt. Himalayas for all natural elements he is the greatest mine of merits. [4-15-20b, 21a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,15,22,"""By that reason, with that unconquerable on in conflicts, an imponderable one and a great-soul Rama, your enmity is inapposite. [4-15-21b, 22a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,15,23,"""Oh dauntless one, I tell you this much that you shall not become overcritical of him, and what I say is beneficial to you that may now be listened and even implemented. [4-15-22b, 23a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,15,24,"""Oh, king, let Sugreeva be decorously and quickly anointed as prince regent, and oh, resolute one, let there be no hostility to your own younger brother. [4-15-23b, 24a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,15,25,"""Achieving unanimity with Sugreeva and solidarity with Rama by discarding enmity, in effect is appropriate for you, thus I deem. [4-15-24b, 25a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,15,26,"""This Sugreeva is your younger brother and you should be keen about him, isn't it... and whether he is here or there in Rishyamuka he is just your brother. [4-15-25b, 26a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,15,27,"""Indeed, I do not see anyone on earth a coequal to him in kindred spirit, hence leave off this enmity and honour him with bestowals and felicitations as an insider, and retain him at your side. [4-15-26b, 27]"
Kishkindha Kanda,15,28,"""That boisterously voiced Sugreeva is indisputably an excellent kinsman of yours, and hence brace yourself with the fondness of brotherhood, as there is no other way out to you."
Kishkindha Kanda,15,29,"""If you look upon to do my favoured deed, and if you look upon me as an expedient one, I beg of you in our loving attachment that my gentle word of advise be done."
Kishkindha Kanda,15,30,"""Be graceful and it behove you to listen to my small but expedient talk, and following up rancour alone is unbecoming of you, thereby your confrontation with the Prince of Kosala will be unpardonable for his dynamism equals that of Indra."" Thus Tara spoke to her husband Vali."
Kishkindha Kanda,15,31,"Then, though Tara spoke beneficial and advisable words they are unimpressive to Vali for he is impounded by fatality and driven by time to his doom."
Kishkindha Kanda,16,1,"While Tara with a face that shines like the lord of stars is speaking thus, Vali dauntingly spoke to her with these words."
Kishkindha Kanda,16,2,"""He is an younger brother and an adversary in particular, oh, pretty-faced Tara, can I by any reason tolerate him when he kept raving on frenetically, tell me."
Kishkindha Kanda,16,3,"""To those valiant ones who neither give ground nor get assailed in wars, oh, shyly, endurance of a overweening war-whoop is more than death."
Kishkindha Kanda,16,4,"""I am incapable of withstanding that dumbly Sugreeva's bawling commotion desiring a brawling duel."
Kishkindha Kanda,16,5,"""Also, you need not bother about Raghava's doing some harm to me, as I wonder how a diligent man and knower of virtue can commit sin."
Kishkindha Kanda,16,6,"""How do you follow me again, you return with all these females, truly you have expressed your friendliness owing to your devotion to me."
Kishkindha Kanda,16,7,"""You may do away with your perplexity as I will retaliate Sugreeva on my going there only to drive him and his arrogance out, but without letting his lives loose."
Kishkindha Kanda,16,8,"""As he is firmed up for a combat, I will indeed have to effectuate what his desire is, by caning with trees and fistfights, by which roughed up he returns."
Kishkindha Kanda,16,9,"""My nerve and pace of combat will be insufferable to that malign minded Sugreeva, oh, Tara, you have offered your helping suggestion and you have shown all your friendliness to me, it is enough."
Kishkindha Kanda,16,10,"""I adjured you on my lives, return with your followers, and I shall return to you on easily defeating and returning that 'brother of mine."" Said Vali to Tara."
Kishkindha Kanda,16,11,"She that pleasant articulator and talented Tara then hugged and circumabulated Vali, suppressing her moaning, as an honour to the braver."
Kishkindha Kanda,16,12,"Then she who is a hymnodist that Tara has performed a hymnal bon voyage wishing triumph to Vali, and entered palace chambers along with other females, disoriented by her own sadness."
Kishkindha Kanda,16,13,"On Tara entering her own palace chambers along with other females, Vali emerged out of the city hissing like an infuriated great snake."
Kishkindha Kanda,16,14,He that highly rancorous Vali suspired with high audacity and spread his sight everywhere intending to sight his enemy.
Kishkindha Kanda,16,15,"Then that celebrated Vali saw Sugreeva who is in golden-ochre hue, whose girdle cloth is tightened for a fight, and who is with an air of self-confidence, blazing like fiery-fire."
Kishkindha Kanda,16,16,That strong armed Vali who is highly provoked has also tightened his girdle cloth on seeing proximately available Sugreeva.
Kishkindha Kanda,16,17,"He that formidable Vali strongly tightening his girdle-cloth too, and proceeded towards Sugreeva in a well timed manner uplifting fists to fight him off."
Kishkindha Kanda,16,18,"Even Sugreeva has come at that imprudent Vali with golden pendant, on tightening his fists, lifting them up at the ready, and aiming them well at Vali."
Kishkindha Kanda,16,19,"Vali spoke this word to that Sugreeva who is swooping down on him, whose eyes are reddened in fury, and who is an expert and expeditious in fighting."
Kishkindha Kanda,16,20,"""Properly clenching fingers this great fist of mine is firmly clenched, and it will unclench only on taking your lives when I pitch this on you at full speed."" So said Vali threateningly to Sugreeva."
Kishkindha Kanda,16,21,"Thus said, Sugreeva with high dudgeon said, ""this fist of mine shall fall on your forehead plundering your lives."""
Kishkindha Kanda,16,22,"Coming near instantaneously Vali hit him, whereby Sugreeva is enraged and became like a mountain streaming blood in its torrents."
Kishkindha Kanda,16,23,But Sugreeva unhesitatingly uprooted a saala tree with his force and thrashed the limbs of Vali as with the thunderbolt thrashing a great mountain.
Kishkindha Kanda,16,24,"But Vali when thwacked with saala tree had staggered and looked like a tossing ship in an ocean filled with heavy weight of merchandise and brimming with merchants, but on the brink of wrecking."
Kishkindha Kanda,16,25,"Those two, Vali and Sugreeva, with their sensational energy, triumphing zeal, frightful physiques, swiftness as good as the Divine Eagle Garuda, vigilance in exploring perilous body parts of one another, ravagement of their own enemies fought frighteningly, like the sun and moon in the sky, which is inconceivable. [4-16-25, 26a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,16,26,"But Vali being the possessor of might and vigour progressed and though greatly mighty is son of sun, Sugreeva, regressed. [4-16-26b, 27a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,16,27,Sugreeva became retardant in aggression when Vali routed his pride and then he exasperatedly started searching for Raghava to counteract Vali.
Kishkindha Kanda,16,28,"Among those two there happened a deadly fight time and again using trees with branches, peaks of mountains, their own nails that are similar to the razor-sharp edges of thunderbolts, and with fists, knees, feet, and arms, like the fight that once chanced between demon Vritra and Indra. [4-16-28b, 29]"
Kishkindha Kanda,16,30,"Those forest moving vanara-s that are soaked in blood have gone on clashing, threatening each other, like two clouds clashing uproariously."
Kishkindha Kanda,16,31,Raghava has then seen the lord of monkeys Sugreeva who is repeatedly eyeing all sides for help and who is even deteriorating in his enterprise.
Kishkindha Kanda,16,32,"On seeing the lord of monkeys Sugreeva in a forlornness, then the refulgent and fearless Rama scanned for an arrow aiming to eliminate Vali."
Kishkindha Kanda,16,33,"Then on tautening a venomous serpent like arrow in the bow, Rama started to draw out bowstring, whereby that bow attained a similitude with the Time-disc of the Terminator."
Kishkindha Kanda,16,34,"At the blast of bowstring the lordly birds and animals are panicked, like those that will be startled by the approach of ear ending, and they all fled."
Kishkindha Kanda,16,35,The arrow released by Raghava that has the boom of thunderbolt's thunderclap and the flashes of a lightning fell on the chest of Vali.
Kishkindha Kanda,16,36,Hit by the fleetness of that arrow then that highly magnificent and intrepid lord of monkeys Vali fell onto the plane of earth.
Kishkindha Kanda,16,37,"Like the flag that will be raised in honour of Indra during the month of ashvin on a full-moon day, but thrown onto earth along with its flagstaff after the festival, Vali with depleted energy and dissipated vitality slowly fell onto ground, and with tears blocking throat he moaned piteously."
Kishkindha Kanda,16,38,"That best one among men Rama released a blazing and enemy subjugating arrow which in simile is like an Epoch-ender at the end of era, and that best arrow decorated in gold and silver looked like the glance from the Third-Eye of Rudra, emitting fire with smoke."
Kishkindha Kanda,16,39,"That Indra's son Vali, dampened with blood and sweat, then looked like just felled Ashoka tree which has stemmed up and so far standing high on a mountain with fully bloomed clusters of its blood-red flowers, and when his anima is undone he even looked like the flagstaff on which a flag is raised in honour of Indra, but which is altogether dislodged and abandoned on the ground."
Kishkindha Kanda,17,1,"When Rama's arrow hit him then Vali, the scourger in war, suddenly fell down like a hewed down tree."
Kishkindha Kanda,17,2,"He who glittered with pure golden ornaments, that Vali fell down on earth while all of his limbs sank to dust, like the flag of Indra when released from its ropes."
Kishkindha Kanda,17,3,"On the fall of that lord of hosts of monkeys and bears onto earth, unilluminated is the earth like the welkin that has forsooth lost its moon."
Kishkindha Kanda,17,4,"Though that great souled Vali fell onto earth, neither his brilliance, nor lives, nor resplendence, nor his bravery are unfettering from his body."
Kishkindha Kanda,17,5,"That superb and gem-studded golden pendent given by Indra sustained that monkey chief's lives, resplendence and brilliance."
Kishkindha Kanda,17,6,"By still wearing that golden chest-pendant around his neck, that brave general of monkeys Vali appeared like a black-cloud smeared with the colour of golden sunset all around its edges."
Kishkindha Kanda,17,7,"Even though Vali has fallen on ground his splendour is as though refulgent devising itself into three aspects, namely by his body, chest-pendant, and the arrow of Rama, which arrow is given to strike the crucial body parts alone, and which is still stuck in Vali's chest."
Kishkindha Kanda,17,8,"That arrow which effectuates the pathway to heaven, now discharged from the bow of Rama has brought forth that redemption to brave Vali ."
Kishkindha Kanda,17,9,"Then on seeing him who has fallen in war, the one with golden pendant, enormously chested, mightily armed, face golden, eye greenish, but who is like a fire extinct of its flame; who is like Indra in unassailability and like Upendra in indomitability; and who like Yayaati who has fallen from heaven, as well like the sun who falls onto earth from solar orbit when Time-ender flings him at the end of era; such as he is, on seeing that son of Indra, who forsooth has fallen, Rama neared him followed by Lakshmana. [4-17-9, 10, 11, 12a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,17,10,"On seeing the brave Vali fallen like that, who by now is like fire with extinguished tongues of flames, and who is seeing droopily, those two valiant brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, neared him with due honour. [4-17-12b, 13]"
Kishkindha Kanda,17,11,"On seeing Rama and the great mighty Lakshmana as well, he who fell to ground flatly hurt by arrow, and whose energy and lives are trifling and vigour trivialised thereby, that Vali spoke these sarcastic words in his proper pride to Rama, who is taking pride in this conflict as a victor, which words at the same time have meaning, politeness, and self-righteousness. [4-17-14, 15]"
Kishkindha Kanda,17,16,"""You are a renowned prince with pleasing looks.. but, which kind of death I am getting now, that too when I was in the commotion of conflict with another, alas, that ignoble death is owing to you, and what merit is achieved by you in this undertaking of yours to kill someone who is facing away from you..."
Kishkindha Kanda,17,13,"""Rama is high-born, they say, gifted with mightiness, resplendent, pursuer of vows, mindful of mercy, delighter in people's welfare, sympathetic, greatly enthusiastic and assertively committed in doing good deeds, knower of time-and-action, all these living-beings on earth are thus relating your renown, aren't they. [4-17-17, 18]"
Kishkindha Kanda,17,19,"""To be able to control senses and will, forgiveness, conscientiousness, resoluteness, truthfulness, and adventurousness, oh, king, are the aptitudes of a king, and even punishing the wrongdoers, too."
Kishkindha Kanda,17,20,"""Concluding that those kingly characteristics will be obtainable in you, and even judging by the noble dynasty of yours, I have confronted Sugreeva though Tara dissuaded me."
Kishkindha Kanda,17,21,"""When you have not appeared before me when I confronted Sugreeva my concept was, 'it will be inapt of Rama to hurt me while I am combating with another combatant, besides, when I will be unvigilant in that fight...'"
Kishkindha Kanda,17,22,"""Not known that your soul is put to death, not known that you are the unrighteous flag bearer of righteousness, to me not known that you are insidious like straw covered well."
Kishkindha Kanda,17,23,"""I have no knowledge that you are a sinner, one in the garb of a benign soul, and explicitly mantled under the garb of probity like ash covered fire."
Kishkindha Kanda,17,19,"""I am non-guilty as I have not committed any misdeed either in your country or in your city, nor I have taunted you; I am a vanara subsisting on fruits and tubers and always moving in forests alone; such as I am, what made you to torture me when I was not combating with you en face, furthermore, when I was involved with another? [4-17-24, 25]"
Kishkindha Kanda,17,26,"""You are renowned to be a prince with charming looks, oh, king, and indications agreeable to rectitude are also appearing on your body."
Kishkindha Kanda,17,27,"""Will anybody born in Kshatriya's family, a learned one in Veda-s, thereby who is rid of ambiguities with respect to right and wrong, and who is cloaked in an air of probity, execute such a ruthless deed like this?"
Kishkindha Kanda,17,28,"""Though born in Raghava's dynasty and renowned as a moralist you are actually amoral, and for what purpose you run around with this moral aspect?"
Kishkindha Kanda,17,29,"""Influencing, largesse, forbearance, probity, candour, and conquering are the attributes of the kings, oh, king, and even punishing the wrongdoers."
Kishkindha Kanda,17,30,"""We as animals live in forests while you are city dwellers, we live by eating fruits and tubers while you enjoy feasts and banquets, our nature is such to kill and get killed, thus you and me have no correlation. And you, even if you are a man and a prince for humans, you resorted to this animalistic way of killing me lying in the wait, thus your action is worse than that of an animal, if not subhuman or un-princely."
Kishkindha Kanda,17,31,"""Territory, gold, and silver will be the causes while counteracting somebody, in that case, by what you are decoyed into these forests of mine or in the fruits of mine."
Kishkindha Kanda,17,32,"""In the pairs of propriety and compliance, punishment and pardoning, no admixture is exercised in kingcraft, for the kings do not conduct themselves volitionally."
Kishkindha Kanda,17,33,"""But, to you your self-interests are primary, and you are a wrathful, capricious, contriver of kingcraft, and an impetuous shooting-happy archer."
Kishkindha Kanda,17,34,"""Oh, king, you have no devotion to probity, nor your mind is firm about material gains, but as a free-willed one you are distracted by senses."
Kishkindha Kanda,17,35,"""How you are answerable to gentlemen, Rama, when you have done this detestable deed of killing an unoffending one like me with your arrow?"
Kishkindha Kanda,17,36,"""A regicide, a Brahman-cide, a cow-slayer, a thief, an inveterate killer, an atheist, and an younger brother who marries before his elder, all of them will go to hell."
Kishkindha Kanda,17,37,"""A slander-monger, skinflint, friend-killer and one who makes love with his teacher's wife, they all go to the worlds of evil-souls, no doubt about it."
Kishkindha Kanda,17,38,"""My skin is unwearable, holy people forbid my hair and bones, and uneatable is my meat for your kind of reputable people."
Kishkindha Kanda,17,39,"""Raghava, five kinds of five-nailed animals, viz., a kind of wild rodent, a kind of wild-boar, a kind of lizard, a hare and fifthly the turtle are edible for Brahmans and Kshatriya-s."
Kishkindha Kanda,17,40,"""Sensible people will not touch my skin and bones, oh, king, nor meats from my body are to be eaten, such as I am, a five-nailed animal, I am killed."
Kishkindha Kanda,17,41,"""Though Tara appraised me with truthful and favourable words, I just disregarded her advise owing to my own delusion, and gone into the control of Time."
Kishkindha Kanda,17,42,"""With you as her espouser the Earth is not with a correct spouse, as with any lady who is with full-fledged chastity, but with a husband who is without rectitude."
Kishkindha Kanda,17,43,"""How are you borne to that great-souled Dasharatha when you are artful, felonious, knavish, disposed to a false modesty subconsciously, and an evildoer?"
Kishkindha Kanda,17,44,"""I am killed by an elephant called Rama that snapped off its girdle-cord called tradition, that infringed the conventions of righteous people, and that discarded the goad called virtue."
Kishkindha Kanda,17,45,"""On accomplishing this sort of unpropitious, unjustified killing, which is condemned by the righteous people, what can you say when you meet the godly men?"
Kishkindha Kanda,17,46,"""The valour that which is displayed on the unprejudiced few like us, oh, Rama, I do not see that sort of valour is shown by you in respect of your enemies."
Kishkindha Kanda,17,47,"""Had you been in combat with me en face oh, prince, you would have been killed by me and by now you would have seen the death-god Yama."
Kishkindha Kanda,17,48,"""An unassailable one, such as I am, I am killed by you while you remained invisible on the field of fight, as with a sinner bitten by a snake while he is asleep."
Kishkindha Kanda,17,43,"""For which purpose I am killed, intending to do good to Sugreeva is incidental to it, you should have assigned me for that purpose in the first instance itself, and I would have brought that evil-minded demon Ravana, the abductor of your wife in one day, that too without killing him in any fight, but by fastening him by neck, and I would have presented Maithili to you. [3-17-49, 50]"
Kishkindha Kanda,17,51,"""I would have brought Maithili at your order even if she is lodged in oceanic waters or in nether worlds, as with the White Horse of Vedic lore."
Kishkindha Kanda,17,52,"""The fact of Sugreeva's getting the kingdom after my going to heaven is proper, but the fact of your killing me in war, unrighteously, is improper."
Kishkindha Kanda,17,53,"""Admittedly the world is this way, and if possible a relevant reply may gently be thought ofabout your propriety in killing me..."" So said Vali to Rama."
Kishkindha Kanda,17,54,"That great-souled son of a vanara king Vali, whom the arrow impaled and agonised, on keenly seeing Rama whose resplendence equals the brightness of the sun, said that much and remained silent when his mouth has dried up."
Kishkindha Kanda,18,1,"Thus, Vali who is hit down by arrow and who is collapsing humbly spoke exacting words that contained probity, meaningfulness, and expedience, to Rama."
Kishkindha Kanda,18,2,"Then to him who is rendered like a lusterless sun, fizzling out like a cloud that released its water, and who became like a quenched fire, to such a best monkey and an unexcelled lord of monkeys who has just now imputed Rama with words that are abounding with righteousness and meaningfulness, Rama spoke subsequently. [4-18-3, 4]"
Kishkindha Kanda,18,4,"""Uncaring for probity, prosperity, pleasure deriving, and even for the social conventions, now how do you rebuke me childishly in this matter?"
Kishkindha Kanda,18,5,"""Unconsulted are the doyens of your race that are intellectually well off and agreeable to your mentors about rights and wrongs about your deeds, oh, gentle one, how do you wish to debate with me in this matter with your primate's caprice."
Kishkindha Kanda,18,6,"""This earth with its mountains, woods, and forests, even along with the authority to condone or condemn the animals, birds, and humans on it belongs to Ikshvaku-s."
Kishkindha Kanda,18,7,"""He who is virtue-souled, truth-abiding, plain-speaking, and the knower of the import of probity, pleasures, and prosperity, and the one who is concerned in controlling or condoning his subjects, that Bharata is the ruler of earth."
Kishkindha Kanda,18,8,"""In whom both scrupulousness and benignancy are there, truthfulness is firmed up, and valour as evinced by scriptures is evident, and he who is the knower of time and place is the king, namely Bharata."
Kishkindha Kanda,18,9,"""Holding his virtuous decree desiring to keep up the continuum of righteousness, we and some other kings are wayfaring this earth in its entirety."
Kishkindha Kanda,18,10,"""While that Bharata, the kingly-tiger and a patron of virtue, is ruling the earth in its entirety, who is there to conduct himself in an unacceptable way to morality on it?"
Kishkindha Kanda,18,11,"""Abiding in our own pre-eminent righteousness, and even abiding by the order of Bharata we punish him who deviated from the path of morality, according to custom."
Kishkindha Kanda,18,12,"""As for you, you brought virtue to a state of decadence, rendered yourself reprovable by your own decadent behaviour, for carnality alone has become your primary doctrine, and thus you have not abided by the conduct meetly to a king."
Kishkindha Kanda,18,13,"""It is to be known by him who treads the way of righteousness that he has three fatherly personages, namely his own father, his elder brother, and the one who accords education to him."
Kishkindha Kanda,18,14,"""An younger brother, a son, and a disciple with good characteristics, these three are to be deemed as one's own sons, for such matters take base on rectitude alone."
Kishkindha Kanda,18,15,"""The probity practised by principled people is very subtle and highly imponderable, and the soul that abides in the hearts of all beings alone can differentiate between just and unjust."
Kishkindha Kanda,18,16,"""Like a blind by birth counselling with similarly blind, you being a vacillant, on your counselling only with frantic minded vacillant monkeys, what can you really fathom about right and wrong?"
Kishkindha Kanda,18,17,"""I will clarify about the words I have said, but I tell you that it is indeed inapt of you to disdain me just out of your outrage."
Kishkindha Kanda,18,18,"""Realise this reason by which I have eliminated you... you misbehaved with your brother's wife, forsaking the perpetual tradition."
Kishkindha Kanda,18,19,"""While the great-souled Sugreeva is still alive, you with your habit of sinful acts have lustily misbehaved with Sugreeva's wife Ruma, who should be counted as your daughter-in-law."
Kishkindha Kanda,18,20,"""Thereby, oh, vanara, this punishment is imposed on you, for your dissolute sinning in abusing your brother's wife, thereby for your transgression of tradition and virtue."
Kishkindha Kanda,18,21,"""I foresee no other kind of control other than punishment to him who conducts himself contrary to the society and who is deviant of conventions."
Kishkindha Kanda,18,21,"""As a Kshatriya emerged from a best dynasty I do not tolerate your wrongdoing, and the punishment to the one who lustfully indulges with his daughter, or with his sister, or with the wife of his younger brother is his elimination, as recalled from scriptures.

Kishkindha Kanda,18,22,"While Bharata is the lord of land and we are his proxies adhering to his orders, and while you too have overstepped the bounds of rightness, then how is it possible to be lenient? [4-18-23b, 24a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,18,23,"""While ruling righteously sensible Bharata punishes him who oversteps the momentous virtue, and he is poised to put down lustful ones. [4-18-24b, 25a]"

Kishkindha Kanda,18,26,"""My association with Sugreeva is as good as that with Lakshmana, nevertheless it betided with an understanding to regain Sugreeva's wife and kingdom, and he will give succour to me."
Kishkindha Kanda,18,27,"""I gave a promise to Sugreeva at the time of befriending him in the presence of vanara-s, and how is it possible for my kind to dishonour a given promise?"
Kishkindha Kanda,18,28,"""Thereby you have to infer that a befitting punishment is given to you, owing to all these great reasons that abound with virtue and with supreme value."
Kishkindha Kanda,18,29,"""Anywise, you have to regard the punishment given to you is legitimate, and he whom rectitude guides has to render assistance to his friend, in any event."
Kishkindha Kanda,18,30,"""Had you pursued rightness you too would have done the same deed in imposing such a punishment, and we hear two verses that are given to the advocacy of good conventions, which the experts of rightness have also accepted, and which are said to be coined by Manu, and I too conducted myself only as detailed in those verses of law."
Kishkindha Kanda,18,31,""" 'When kings impose proper punishment on the humans who have sinned, they become sinless and enter heaven as with the pious souls with good deeds.' So says one verse of Manu."
Kishkindha Kanda,18,32,""" 'Either by punishment or by clemency a thief will be absolved from sin, but the king who does not impose proper punishment will derive the blot of that sin.' So says the other verse of Manu."
Kishkindha Kanda,18,33,"""When a renouncer has committed sin like that of the one committed by you, my venerable ancestor Maandhaata has given punishment which he desired."
Kishkindha Kanda,18,34,"""Such sin is acquired even by other kings who are unobservant in imposing proper punishment, and those kings had to make amends for it at appropriate time, by that propitiation they used to mitigate that filth of that sin."
Kishkindha Kanda,18,35,"""Thereby, enough with your annoyance, oh, tigerly vanara, as your elimination is devised righteously, and we too are not independent."
Kishkindha Kanda,18,36,"""Oh, brave and best one among monkeys, further listen to another cause, and on listening that important cause you will not be infuriated."
Kishkindha Kanda,18,36,"""I have neither angst nor ire in this matter of my eliminating you, or, your reviling me, oh, best monkey, but listen to the other point I wish to make clear.

Kishkindha Kanda,18,44,"Vali is much distressed at heart of hearts when Rama has said categorically in that way, whereby, deriving certitude about rightness he found no incorrectness with Rama."
Kishkindha Kanda,18,45,"That lord of vanara-s then replied Rama with adjoined palms, ""oh, best one among men, what all you have said is that way proper, undoubtedly."

Kishkindha Kanda,18,49,"Vali who like an elephant plumped in slough continued to say slowly, with tears fully impeding his throat and with an agonised moan, on keenly observing Rama."
Kishkindha Kanda,18,50,"""Also, I neither worry for myself, nor for Tara, nor even for any relatives of mine, as I do for my son Angada, the best-virtuous one with golden bicep-lets."

Kishkindha Kanda,18,59,"Rama consoled Vali with words that are agreeable to savants and that contain the essence and meaning of rightness, while Vali is with an evincible perspective of righteousness by now. And Rama spoke to Vali this way."
Kishkindha Kanda,18,60,"""Oh, fly-jumper, you need not be remorseful about your wife, son and others you leave behind, because we take care of them... nor you should bother about us thinking that we have arbitrarily eliminated you, nor necessarily bother about yourself for committing sins, as we took this decision according to rightness and considerateness in your respect."
Kishkindha Kanda,18,61,"""He who administers punishment to the punishable, and he who is punishable and gets punished, both of them will achieve the results of cause and effect, where punishment is the effect from the cause of wrongdoing, and they both thereby will not be condemned."

Kishkindha Kanda,18,65,"On hearing the agreeable and assertive words of that great-souled Rama, who is the treader on the path of rightness and an absolute crusher of enemies in war, Vali, the vanara, spoke these well-disposed words to Rama."
Kishkindha Kanda,18,66,"""Oh, lord, oh, tremendously braving one, oh, Rama, the lord of people, I blamed you when your arrow sweltered and rendered me imbecile, thus I blamed you unthinkingly for which I may please be pardoned, I appease you for the same."
Kishkindha Kanda,19,1,"That great vanara king Vali who is sprawling agonised by arrow, and to whom Rama gave a reply with well-reasoned words did not find any other reply to be given to Rama."
Kishkindha Kanda,19,2,"He who is heavily thrashed with trees, whose limbs are variously cracked with boulders, and whom Rama's arrow finally vanquished, that Vali fainted at the time of his breathing his last."
Kishkindha Kanda,19,3,"Tara, wife of Vali, heard that the tigerly monkey Vali perished in fight by the arrow released by Rama."
Kishkindha Kanda,19,4,"On hearing the very gruesome killing of her husband that is unpleasant, she is highly anguished and rushed out of Kishkindha along with Angada."
Kishkindha Kanda,19,5,"On seeing Rama with bow those very mighty vanara-s that form the escort of Angada are scared to death, and they very quickly fled from there towards Kishkindha."
Kishkindha Kanda,19,6,"Then on her way towards field of combat she saw the monkeys that are frightened and fleeing in disorder, like those animals that have wandered off from their herd when their master is killed."
Kishkindha Kanda,19,7,"Nearing those monkeys that are already distressed at the fall of Vali, and that are highly frightened by Rama, and that are fleeing as though Rama's arrow is still tracking them down, Tara spoke to all of them, distressed as she is."

Kishkindha Kanda,19,20,"Saying thus she started to wail and convulse in agony, and slapped her head and chest with both of her hands while she speedily rushed towards Vali."
Kishkindha Kanda,19,21,"While she is still trudging then she saw her husband who is the destroyer of arch-demons like Maayaavi and Dundubhi, and who never retreated in combats, but now fallen down on ground."
Kishkindha Kanda,19,22,"She saw Vali who is a flinger of loftiest mountains as with Indra flinging his thunderbolt, who is a blaster as with great gusty winds, and who is a roarer as with a cluster of great black-clouds."
Kishkindha Kanda,19,23,"He who equals Indra in the invasion of enemies, a violent thunderer at the opponent thunderers, a brave one felled by still brave one, and who is like a best animal killed by a tiger for the purpose of flesh, and quietened like black-cloud at the end of downpour, At him she saw."
Kishkindha Kanda,19,24,"He who is like a sanctum that is hitherto worshipped by all people, that is decorated with flags and demarcated with podia, but just ravaged by an eagle for the sake of a snake which sneaked into that sanctum, and Tara saw such a Vali plumped on the ground."
Kishkindha Kanda,19,25,"She saw Rama standing and abutting on his very powerful bow, and his younger brother Lakshmana, even at the younger brother of her husband, namely Sugreeva."
Kishkindha Kanda,19,26,"Going past them she reached her husband who is routed in combat, and on observing him closely she indeed fell down on earth as she is distraught and dumbfounded."
Kishkindha Kanda,19,27,"On getting up as though reawakened from sleep she saw her husband bound fast by the strings of death, and then she wailingly addressed him as, ""oh, nobleman's son..."""
Kishkindha Kanda,19,28,"On observing her who is wailing like a female osprey, and even on looking at Angada who arrived there, a miserable remorse came upon Sugreeva."
Kishkindha Kanda,20,1,"On seeing her husband felled to ground with a terminator like arrow released by Rama, that resentful lady Tara whose face is lovely like the moon, reached and embraced him."
Kishkindha Kanda,20,2,"Tara is agonised when she saw the elephantine and mountainous vanara, namely Vali, reduced to no more than an uprooted tree, and she wailed fretfully with grief scorching heart. [4-20-2b, 3]"
Kishkindha Kanda,20,4,"""Oh, stern one in fights, oh, victorious one, oh, best valiant, oh, best flier, I have never blamed you either in your presence or in your absence, why do not you talk to me now?"
Kishkindha Kanda,20,5,"""Arise, oh, tigerly monkey, you have to make use of a best bed as best kings will not on repose on soil in this way, isn't it."
Kishkindha Kanda,20,6,"""The earth seems to be a highly cherished darling of yours, oh, lord of the land, as you still embrace her with your limbs leaving me off, even when your lives are drained."
Kishkindha Kanda,20,7,"""It is evident that you, who conduct yourself righteously, must have built a Kishkindha-like delightful city in the pathway to heaven by your leaving lovely Kishkindha."
Kishkindha Kanda,20,8,"""You bring an end to the pleasure trips you made along with us in the sweet smelling forests from time to time by your departing."
Kishkindha Kanda,20,9,"""When this fifth state betiding you, oh, great chief of chiefs of monkeys, I am dejected, despaired and drowned in the sea of sadness."
Kishkindha Kanda,20,10,"""My heart is very sturdy - perhaps, even on seeing you slain and fallen to ground, it is not splintering now into thousand splints, though it is tormented by sorrow."
Kishkindha Kanda,20,11,"""By which reason you have snatched away Sugreeva's wife, oh, chief of fliers, and even expelled him from Kishkindha, that is the reason why you got this result."
Kishkindha Kanda,20,12,"""I am she who said a beneficial word to you with an interest in your well-being and wishing your welfare, but oh, best monkey, you unmindfully brushed me off."
Kishkindha Kanda,20,13,"""Oh, endower of honour, apsara-s, the celestial dancers, will be proud of their beauty, youthfulness, and expertise in romance, and oh, honourable one, you can stir up their hearts towards you by your gallantry, definite is that."
Kishkindha Kanda,20,13,"""The Time which is an undoubtable factor in respect of anybody has ended your life, definite is that, and that Time alone perforce brought you, who are otherwise an uncontrollable force, to the control of Sugreeva."
Kishkindha Kanda,20,14,"The Death / Time no doubt has a concern with anyone for it is the ender of life, and definitely it chanced upon you by the capability of Sugreeva in getting support of Rama, and Sugreeva alone controlled you, who are otherwise an uncontrollable force."
Kishkindha Kanda,20,15,"""Rama's killing Vali when he is fighting with another is unbefitting in its method, and he too is not at all worried for doing such a highly deplorable deed."
Kishkindha Kanda,20,16,"""So far I am not doleful or saddened, but now as a desolate seethed by sorrow I have to undergo widowhood and dolefulness."
Kishkindha Kanda,20,17,"""My Angada is raised fondly, a brave one with gracefulness and one who is accustomed to comforts, but which will be the predicament he has to undergo when his paternal-uncle Sugreeva gets into a fit of fury."
Kishkindha Kanda,20,18,"""Oh, son Angada, clearly see your father, a patron of virtue, oh, boy, later it is impossible to catch a glimpse of him."" Thus Tara said to her son Angada."
Kishkindha Kanda,20,19,"""You have started towards other world, isn't it, so reassure your son, kiss goodbye on his forehead, and give me your parting messages."" So said Tara to Vali."
Kishkindha Kanda,20,20,"""Really, Rama has not only done a great deed of hitting you down, but he also achieved indebtedness towards Sugreeva, both in a single promise."
Kishkindha Kanda,20,21,"""Now, you are to your heart's content Sugreeva as you regain your wife Ruma, you may even wallow in the kingdom unworriedly as your enemy-brother is silenced."" So said Tara to Sugreeva."
Kishkindha Kanda,20,22,"""""Oh, lord of monkeys, why do not you talk to me, the dear wife of yours, when I am prattling at length, by the way, several of your comely wives are here, they are here, see them."" Thus Tara lamented."
Kishkindha Kanda,20,23,"On listening Tara's lamentation the vanara females that are around became plaintive, saddened pitiably and wept piteously embracing Angada."
Kishkindha Kanda,20,24,"""Oh, one with bracelets on your mighty arms, why you are going to an eternal abode leaving your dear son Angada? Your going away leaving such a son, who possesses best aptitudes that comes close to your abilities, and the one who always wears an exquisitely pleasant getup, is unbefitting."
Kishkindha Kanda,20,25,"""If I have done any undesirable deed in an indiscriminate way, even in the least, I may be pardoned for that, and here I bow down at your feet... oh, masterful one... oh, the lord of monkeys lineage... oh, brave one... [Thus Tara wept for Vali.]"
Kishkindha Kanda,20,26,"That Tara with her unblemished complexion is seated in the close proximity of her husband along with other vanara females, and weeping pitiably in that way, she decided to self-immolate, and thus she flounced down onto ground where Vali is slouching."
Kishkindha Kanda,21,1,"Hanuma, the leader of monkeys, then neared and slowly consoled Tara who has fallen to ground like a star from sky."
Kishkindha Kanda,21,2,"""Living beings on doing the deeds of merit or demerit, or knowingly or unknowingly, will derive the resultant fruits of those deeds according to one's own destiny even after demise, and they shall bear them unrepentantly, may they be provident or improvident..."
Kishkindha Kanda,21,3,"""Of which lamentable one you lament while you yourself are in a lamentable state? Of which pitiable one you take pity while you yourself are in a pitiable condition? Who is pitiable by whom in these bubbles like bodies?"
Kishkindha Kanda,21,4,"""You are the one with a living son, and you have to look after this young one Angada, and you have to think of the forthcoming activities for his well-being and for his performance of duty towards his father."
Kishkindha Kanda,21,5,"""You are aware that the coming and going of beings, in their subtle forms of earth, water, fire, air and space into this mortal life and back is uncertain, thereby the prudent ones have to perform auspicious worldly deeds here in this world, say, the funeral of Vali."
Kishkindha Kanda,21,6,"""In whom hundreds and thousands of monkeys are harboured and astir, for they have reposed their confidence in him alone, that Vali has arrived at his end."
Kishkindha Kanda,21,7,"""By which reason this Vali conducted himself judiciously, observing friendliness, courteousness and forgivingness, by that reason alone Vali is going to a domain in heavens which he righteously conquered for himself, and it is unapt of your sorrowing for him."
Kishkindha Kanda,21,8,"""All the tigerly-monkeys, oh, impeccable Tara, including this son of yours Angada, and all the lords of monkeys and bears have their guardian angel in you."
Kishkindha Kanda,21,9,"""Oh, lady, inspirit these two, Sugreeva and Angada, that are searing in grief, and if you acquiesce then this Angada will rule over the earth."
Kishkindha Kanda,21,10,"""Whatever duty anticipated from a male descendent towards his father, and whatever activity that is to be done presently in respect of the dying king, let them be done, and that would be a timely decision."
Kishkindha Kanda,21,11,"""Cremation of the king of monkeys and anointment of Angada are the present time affairs, and seeing your son invested on the throne you can obtain peace."" Thus spoke Hanuma to Tara."
Kishkindha Kanda,21,12,"On hearing Hanuma's words she who is tormented by the plight of her husband, that Tara replied Hanuma who is standing nearby."
Kishkindha Kanda,21,13,"""Let there be a hundred selfsame Angada-s on one side, and this brave one the other, for me embracing him who is put to death is the best ..."
Kishkindha Kanda,21,14,"""Who am I either for conducting the monkeys kingdom or to anoint Angada when Angada's paternal-uncle Sugreeva is close at hand?"
Kishkindha Kanda,21,15,"""Hanuma, this thinking of yours that Angada is to be crowned is really untenable, oh, best monkey, father is the real defender of a son, but not the mother."
Kishkindha Kanda,21,16,"""Indeed there is nothing highly befitting to me, either in this world or in the other, than the auspices of the king of monkeys, and now to me the only befitting thing is to join in this brave one on this death bed, which he is adoring when put to death while he is facing away."
Kishkindha Kanda,22,1,"With his life-force slowing down Vali respired slowly glancing everywhere, and he firstly saw his brother Sugreeva afore him."
Kishkindha Kanda,22,2,"Vali nodding at Sugreeva, who achieved triumph and became the lord of fly-jumpers, amicably spoke this to him in an unambiguous tone."
Kishkindha Kanda,22,3,"""Sugreeva, reckon me not by my iniquities, but reckon as one who is all the while forcibly hauled into this futurity owing to my impropriety and obduracy."
Kishkindha Kanda,22,4,"""I do not think that we two are fated to share blissfulness simultaneously, oh, boy, therefore the amity seemly to brothers has cropped up otherwise."
Kishkindha Kanda,22,5,"""You realize that I am going to the abode of Time-god now itself, and hence propose yourself as king of this forest-dweller's kingdom, now itself."
Kishkindha Kanda,22,6,"""Such as I am, I am indeed forgoing my life, kingdom, and this immense prosperity and even the unenviable glory which adduces that 'Vali is unkillable,' right away."
Kishkindha Kanda,22,7,"""Oh, valiant Sugreeva, it will be apt of you to make happen the word I am going to say even in such a situation in which now I am, and oh, king, even if that word of mine is infeasible."
Kishkindha Kanda,22,8,"""Have a look at this Angada, who is privileged for all happiness, brought up in all comforts, though a boy he is mannerly, and who with his tear-filled face fallen onto ground."
Kishkindha Kanda,22,9,"""More dear than my own lives is my son, and when he is deprived of me you have to foster him as if he is your own son, with no resources becoming sparse in every way."
Kishkindha Kanda,22,10,"""Oh, king of fly-jumpers, as with me you too are his father, patron, an overall protector from all sides, and also thus an assurer in fear."
Kishkindha Kanda,22,11,"""This admirable son of Tara is a coequal of yours in triumphs, and in eliminating those demons he will be in your advance guard."
Kishkindha Kanda,22,12,"""This mighty and sinewy son of Tara is youthful, and on overtaking in war this Angada will undertake actions seemly for a son of mine."
Kishkindha Kanda,22,13,"""In deciding meanings in all their subtleties and also in presages of diverse nature this daughter of Sushena, Tara, is an insightful one in every way."
Kishkindha Kanda,22,14,"""Whatever is said by her as proper that is doable indubitably, indeed nothing contrary happens to her opinions, in the least."
Kishkindha Kanda,22,15,"""You have to accomplish Raghava's mission undoubtedly, and if it is unaccomplished there will be infraction on your part because you befriended him before an altar of fire, and you may even be punished for dishonouring him and your given word to him."
Kishkindha Kanda,22,16,"""The bounteous goddess of triumph ensconced in this golden pendant will completely leave it off on my death, avoiding the flaw of touching a corpse, isn't it... hence oh, Sugreeva, you wear it."" Thus Vali spoke to Sugreeva."
Kishkindha Kanda,22,17,"Thus, that way when Vali spoke to Sugreeva with brotherly kind-heartedness, Sugreeva again waned away forgoing his spiritedness, like the lord of stars, namely the Moon, when eaten away by the planet, namely Rahu, during lunar eclipse."
Kishkindha Kanda,22,18,"Quietened by Vali's words and conducting himself befittingly and attentively in the given situation, Sugreeva has then taken that golden chain only when Vali authorised him."
Kishkindha Kanda,22,19,"On giving away that golden pendant, and on seeing his son who is available nearby, readying himself towards his end that is setting in, Vali affectionately spoke to Angada."
Kishkindha Kanda,22,20,"""From now on, observing time and place you have to tolerate pain or pleasure, endure mirth or misery on your going under the control of Sugreeva."
Kishkindha Kanda,22,21,"""Oh dextrous Angada, as to how I have entertained you in whichever way you conducted yourself with me, Sugreeva may not approve of such a puerile behaviour of yours, if you resort to it."
Kishkindha Kanda,22,22,"""Do not reach at his unfriendly ones, nor come near his enemies, oh, enemy-destroyer Angada, you shall be in the control of Sugreeva attending to the purposes of your lord with self-control."
Kishkindha Kanda,22,23,"""Do not conduct yourself with excessive friendliness or unfriendliness, as this pair of opposites itself has a flaw, therefore you cultivate an intermediary outlook."" Vali thus spoke to Angada."
Kishkindha Kanda,22,24,"He who is highly tortured by the arrow of Rama spoke to Angada in that way, and afterwards his eyeballs rolled-up, mouth hung open baring his horrid teeth, and his life too took to flight from his body."
Kishkindha Kanda,22,25,"Then, all those best monkeys avaialble there have started to weep when their monkey chief is dead, and for that matter they have loudly squawked at his death in this way."
Kishkindha Kanda,22,26,"""When the lord of monkeys departed to heaven Kishkindha is indeed rendered derelict, dreary are the gardens, deserted are the mountains and forests as well, and when the tiger among fly-jumpers is dead all the vanara-s are rendered up into a lacklustre life. [4-22-26, 27a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,22,27,"""And by the impetus of whose great rapidity flowers available in forests and woodlands used to shower on him in torrents and enwreathe him from behind, that Vali is no more, and now who has got such an impetus? [4-22-27b, 28a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,22,28,"""By which great-souled Vali a ferocious duel was given to the celestial, namely the great armed Golabha, which did not cease either in the daytime or night till Vali felled Golabha, that Vali is no more. [4-22-28b, 29]"
Kishkindha Kanda,22,30,"""Thereafter, in the sixteenth year Vali unquestionably felled Golabha, and on killing that evil-minded Golabha with his zigzag teeth Vali accorded fearlessness to all of us, how such a Vali is felled now?"" Thus the monkeys raised hue and cry."
Kishkindha Kanda,22,31,"But when that fly-jumper's brave lord Vali is killed, those fly-jumpers have gone into a freneticness in that matter of Vali's killing, as with the cows becoming frenetic when their husbanding bull is killed while moving in a great forest that is riddled with a lion."
Kishkindha Kanda,22,32,"But then Tara, whelmed under a ocean called affliction closely observed her dead husband's face, embraced him and collapsed onto ground as with any creeper plant when the giant tree on which it is hinging is hacked down."
Kishkindha Kanda,23,1,Then that renowned Tara closely whiffed that face of monkey's king Vali and spoke these words to her dead husband.
Kishkindha Kanda,23,2,"""Heedless of my word, oh, brave one, you are reposing miserably on a very rough and uneven ground spread with stones."
Kishkindha Kanda,23,3,"""This earth must definitely be your beloved one, oh, best of monkeys, why because, you still embrace her while you recline on her, without replying me."
Kishkindha Kanda,23,4,"""You have gone into the control of Sugreeva and Sugreeva alone triumphed, oh, brave one, oh, enthusiast in adventures, oho, is it fated to happen this way."
Kishkindha Kanda,23,5,"""These chiefs of bears and monkeys are adoring you in every respect as their most worshipful one, and on hearing their despairing wailing, and the lamentation of Angada, and even these utterance of mine in keen, why do not you comeback to senses. [3-23-5, 6a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,23,6,"""Do you wish to repose on the very daybed on which you have laid your enemies to rest when you have once felled them in fights, or what? [3-23-6b, 7a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,23,7,"""Oh, successor of a clan with pristine calibre, oh, accorder of dignity, oh, devotee of fighting, oh, my dear, have you gone on leaving me without a protector and lonely? [3-23-7b, 8a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,23,8,"""Really considerate fathers shall never propose brides to adventurers, they say. Yes! See me the wife of an adventurer, in a trice rendered as a war-widow left in the lurch. [3-23-8b, 9a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,23,9,"""My honour is degenerated and my eternal happiness is disintegrated, and I am deluged in an abyssal boundless ocean called anguish. [3-23-9b, 10a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,23,10,"""And dense with metallic substance is this heart of mine in its solidity, since it is not splintering into hundredfold even on seeing my husband killed, it is definite. [3-23-10b, 11a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,23,11,"""By your nature you are my beloved, besides, you are a good-hearted one, more so, you are my husband, moreover, you are a valiant triumphing over your enemies in assaults, such as you are you have attained the fifth state, the death. [3-23-11b, 12a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,23,12,"""Perhaps a woman might have mothered many children, and perhaps affluent with riches and crops, still people will call her a widow, if she is without husband. [3-23-12b, 13a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,23,13,"""How do you repose now on a sheet of blood flowing from your own body, oh, brave one, as if you are reclining on your own bed spread with a bed sheet of red blood colour? [3-23-13b, 14a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,23,14,"""I have no strength to closely embrace you with both my arms, oh, best fly-jumper, when the blood and dust covering your body comes in between. [3-23-14b, 15a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,23,15,"""Single arrow released by Rama has doubly benefited Sugreeva in this highly deplorable enmity between you and Sugreeva, as his ambition to become the king is fulfilled and his fear from your persecution, too, is evanished. [3-23-15b, 16a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,23,16,"""In vain, I have been watching you without a wink, on whom fatality has descended, as this arrow stuck in your chest is hindering me to embrace you..."" Thus wailed Tara. [3-23-16b, 17a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,23,17,"""Then the monkey chief Nila extricated that arrow which is stuck in the chest of Vali, as with the extraction of a firmly wedged sparkling snake from the cavity of a mound. [3-23-17b, 18a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,23,18,"The sparkle of Rama's arrow while it is being extracted from Vali's chest is much the same as the sparkles of more brilliant sunrays that are extracted by the end of daytime, when the sun is sinking beyond the summit of dusky western mountain, and as contrasted with the hue of dusk. [3-23-18b, 19a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,23,19,"The blood streams flown out of the gashes of Vali fell everywhere like the streams of water flowing from a mountain saturated with coppery mineral-ores. [3-23-19b, 20a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,23,20,"On wiping off war dust with which her husband is muffled up, with tears gushing from her eyes she drenched that valiant one who is summarily hit by the missile of Rama. [3-23-20b, 21a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,23,21,"On giving attention to all of the blood wet limbs of her slain husband that lady Tara spoke to her son Angada whose eyes are coppery-red. [3-23-21b, 22a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,23,22,"""See the highly harrowing end time plight of your father, oh, son, he reached his end owing to the enmity harnessed by sinful deeds. [3-23-22b, 23a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,23,23,"""To him, whose physical splendour vied with the dazzle of rising sun, to that father, king, and the accorder of honour you pay you last obeisance as he journeyed to the abode of Time-god."" Thus Tara said to Angada. [3-23-23b, 24a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,23,24,"When he is said so, Angada swiftly rose and touched the feet of his father with both of his rotund-shouldered sinewy arms saying, ""father, I am Angada..."" [3-23-24b, 25a]"

Kishkindha Kanda,23,26,"""I am living through seeing the lifeless state of yours with the help of my son, no more than a helpless cow that sits near her bull with its calf, when that bull is slain by a lion, just now. [3-23-26b, c]"
Kishkindha Kanda,23,27,"""How can you singly take the ultimate bath of a Vedic ritual after your conducting a ritual like combat, in the waters called bloodstreams caused by Rama's arrow, that too, when I, your wife, am available like a co-officiator of a Vedic ritual?"
Kishkindha Kanda,23,28,"""Now where is that treasured golden pendant of yours which the king of gods gave to you when he is satisfied with your conduct in wars, I don't see it?"
Kishkindha Kanda,23,29,"""Majesty is not deserting you even if your lives have departed, oh, accorder of dignity, as with the sunshine that departs the sun while he circumnavigates Mt. Meru, which mount is supposed to overshadow everything by its vastness."
Kishkindha Kanda,23,30,"""Neither you heeded my word of expediency, nor I was indeed capable to forestall you, and I am doomed along with my son when you are exterminated in fight, whereby the Grace that forsook you, is deserting me too, in its entirety."
Kishkindha Kanda,24,1,"A word about this chapter. The bardic tradition is in the habit of including everything, while the critical editions exclude anything arbitrary. This chapter is excluded in the critical editions, but traditional versions retained it, and all publications publish this. The scholars have also said that all the forty-four verses in here have no stamp of Valmiki, the verbiage and verbosity are heightened, even the meter is overfilled, and even the word positioning does not yield proper meaning. Even so, all are retained in all publications. However, it may be mentioned that if some Valmiki Jr. written and included this chapter, it should have been ages before, but not in the known ages, because Dharmaakuutam, Govindaraja and others have commentaries on chapter. In all the commentaries an exhaustive commentary is there on two verses uttered by Tara, which is included here also."
Kishkindha Kanda,24,1,"On seeing Tara who quickly deluged in a speedy and vast ocean of intolerable anguish, then that Vali's mighty brother Sugreeva regretted for the killing of his matchless brother."
Kishkindha Kanda,24,2,"While that kind hearted Sugreeva observed Tara for a moment he is despaired at heart, tears filled his face, and lamenting very much he slowly paced to the near of Rama, surrounded by his attendants."
Kishkindha Kanda,24,3,"On approaching him who is majestic, who is still handling his bow and snake-like arrow, a distinguished person with all of his limbs adorned with great attributes that an emperor should have by birth, to such a Raghava who is standing nearby, Sugreeva spoke this way."
Kishkindha Kanda,24,4,"""As promised, oh, best king, you have accomplished this deed with its eventual fruition of getting back the kingdom and my wife, but now, oh, prince, my heart is backsliding from extravagances of kingdom and kingship, as my life itself is rendered despicable, for I got my brother killed."
Kishkindha Kanda,24,5,"""When the king is killed, this empress is wailing bitterly, much wailing is there in city scorched in sadness, and Angada too is in a doubtful state of sustaining his lives in the fond of his father, as such oh, Rama, my heart is not taking delight in kingdom."
Kishkindha Kanda,24,6,"""In the first instance I have agreed for the elimination of my brother owing to my anger, intolerance and as I was subjected to too much ignominy, but now, oh, best one from Ikshvaku-s, when the chief of monkeys Vali is put to death, I am painfully remorseful."
Kishkindha Kanda,24,7,"""I think it would be better for me to live on that best mountain Rishyamuka for ever in an as is where is condition, somehow spending life befitting to a monkey, and achieving even heaven on killing my brother is of no good."
Kishkindha Kanda,24,8,"""The words which he used to speak to me saying, 'I do not wish to kill you, begone...' are befitting to that great-souled and rational vanara, and my words in asking you to him to kill him, and my deeds in getting him killed are befitting to me, as an irrational vanara."
Kishkindha Kanda,24,9,"""Indeed, oh, brave Rama, whether killing one's own brother will be self-torturous? Or, taking pleasure in kingdom on killing that brother will be more? Or, the distress ensuing that killing will be the most? Without truly discriminating these cruces, even if one has one's own own avarice in prospect, who is he that is going to take pleasure in killing his own highly honoured brother? Excepting me!"
Kishkindha Kanda,24,10,"""Killing me is not in the intent of Vali violating his probity, but my intent has become evilly life taking, violating my own probity."
Kishkindha Kanda,24,11,"""I was whining for a time when Vali thrashed me with a tree branch, as if with a schoolmaster's cane, but later on comforting me he said this to me, 'do not do this again, this daring me to fight you back.'"
Kishkindha Kanda,24,12,"""Fraternity, dignity and also probity are conserved by him, while I exhibited furiousness, enviousness and also naughtiness of a monkey."
Kishkindha Kanda,24,13,"""As Indra acquired sin on killing Vishvarupa, the son of Tvastha, I too derived a sin by killing my brother, which sin is absolutely unimaginable for quantification, totally undesirable at any given time, wholly discardable by sagacious souls, and a disgustingly horrible spectre of brotherly hate."
Kishkindha Kanda,24,14,"""Earth, waters, trees and women took the burden of Indra's sins, but who in name will bear the burden of this sin of mine, that too the sin of a monkey, who wishes to share?"
Kishkindha Kanda,24,15,"""On undertaking this sort of deed that includes unjust and involves ruination of one's own race, I am unsuited for this sort of accolade from the subjects of this kingdom, and when I am ineligible to be the price regent of this kingdom, wherefore to become its regent?"
Kishkindha Kanda,24,16,"""In this world, I am a committer of a felony which is debased, highly damnable and pernicious to the world itself, whereupon this irresistible misery is rushing in on me, as with the rush of speeding rainy-waters towards a declivity."

Kishkindha Kanda,24,18,"""How difficult is this insufferable sacrilege of mine, oh, best king, owing to which my good breeding is shed from my heart, as with the gold, which if alloyed will be intolerant of that filth, but oh, Raghava, even the gold sheds itself from scum when melted, and though I melt in grief this scum of sacrilege is unshed."
Kishkindha Kanda,24,19,"""I think this body of great-might monkey commanders is withstanding its lives in a halfway, oh, Raghava, just because of me and this Angada who is searing in anguish, for it is half-dead with the death of Vali."

Kishkindha Kanda,24,20,"It is somehow easy to get a son who is an easygoing, easy to deal with like Angada in this world, but, oh, valiant Rama, where is the world wherein I can get Vali-like brother and wherein can be in his vicinity?"
Kishkindha Kanda,24,21,"""This best of brave ones, Angada, will not live reft of his father, but his mother Tara has to live to foster her son Angada, but if Angada dies with his heartbroken for his farther, then without her son her misery will become miserable, and then she too may not live... this is my resolve."

Kishkindha Kanda,24,23,"""Oh, prince, even if I am dead your mission will be achieved in its entirety, and oh, Rama, having perpetrated infraction I have become an eliminator of the propriety of our race, hence I have become an unworthy one to live, and hence permit me to commit myself to fire..."" Thus Sugreeva said to Rama."
Kishkindha Kanda,24,24,"On hearing the anguished words of the younger brother of Vali, namely Sugreeva, the eyes of Rama, the best valiant one from Raghu's dynasty and the eliminator of valiant enemies, are moistened and he became perturbed for a moment."
Kishkindha Kanda,24,25,"At that moment, Rama whose perseverance is like that of the earth and who is the protector of earth has seen Tara, who is wailing and repeatedly looking around as she is deluged in desperation, and then with all his concernedness Rama paced towards her."
Kishkindha Kanda,24,26,"The prominent monkey ministers then started to raise her up, whose eyes are pleasant and intellect unfailing, and who had the lion among monkeys as her husband, but now collapsed on ground hugging her departed husband."
Kishkindha Kanda,24,27,"She who is hugging her husband wriggled highly when she is disengaged from him, and at a particular stage she saw Rama with his bow and arrow in his hands and who is resplendent like sun, by his own resplendence."
Kishkindha Kanda,24,28,"On seeing at him whose eyes are graceful, one endowed with all kingly attributes, who looked best among men, and who is unseen so far, that fawn-eyed Tara realized him alone as that Rama."
Kishkindha Kanda,24,29,"She on whom misfortune has chanced and who is anguished, that noble lady Tara went very quickly with highly squirming movements to the near of the highly exalted soul Rama, who matches Indra in his valour and an unreachable one for his enemies."
Kishkindha Kanda,24,30,"The body language of Tara which is so far disconcerted by the grief felt for Rama's perfect hitting, felling and achieving his object in war, namely Vali, is now disoriented to anger on seeing the very same Rama, as she is a self-respectful lady. But on arriving at the near of that very pure being Rama, that ireful body language of hers again reoriented itself to a sort of serenity, and then she spoke this to him."
Kishkindha Kanda,24,31,"""You are an indeterminable one, an inaccessible one, one with his self conquered, the supreme among righteous souls, your glory is unmitigated, and you are the one with clear discrimination, and in endurance earth-like, and your eyes are blood streaked like those of an emperor."
Kishkindha Kanda,24,34,"""You with your proportionate physic are a mighty one handling bows and arrows, but your bodily magnificence is more than that of magnificent humanly body."
Kishkindha Kanda,24,35,"""You with your proportionate physic are a mighty one handling bows and arrows, but your bodily magnificence is more than that of magnificent humanly body. [4-24-32"
Kishkindha Kanda,24,33,"""Oh, brave one, kill me too with the same arrow with which you have killed my dear husband, and on getting killed at your hand I wish to reach his near, as Vali takes no delight without me."
Kishkindha Kanda,24,34,"""Though Vali with eyes like unblemished lotus petals reaches heaven he looks around for me, and not finding me there, he does not have a romance with celestial apsara-s though they will be in amazing costumes and wear red-coloured towering tiaras."
Kishkindha Kanda,24,35,"""Even though Vali is in heaven he will derive despair and despondency without me, like you, who are despondent and despaired on the pleasant stretches of mountainsides of that best mountain Rishyamuka, as you are without Seetha."
Kishkindha Kanda,24,36,"""How a virile person derives discomfort without his woman, that much you know, isn't it! Because you are aware of it, you kill me; let not Vali get any discomfort when he does not find me."
Kishkindha Kanda,24,37,"""Oh, prince, as a high souled one even if you think that, ""sin of killing a female will not befall on me?"" But deem me as his soul, as scriptures say that the wife is the soul of husband, and hence kill me, then there will not be any blemish of woman killing."
Kishkindha Kanda,24,38,"""In the course of implementing scriptural rituals, and even as contained in various Vedic sayings, wife is not a separate entity than her husband, and no better endowment than endowing a wife to an eligible bridegroom by bride's father is countenanced by the wise men in the world, isn't it."
Kishkindha Kanda,24,39,"""Even you, oh, valiant one, on examining good and bad bestow me to my dear husband, and by that way, oh, brave one, by such an endowment of a wife to her husband, by way of killing and sending her to her husband, you too will not get any touch of sin."
Kishkindha Kanda,24,40,"""Anguished and unprotected, such as I am, oh, king, I am being distracted from my departed husband by these Vanara misters, and it is unapt of you to not to kill me, as I am incapable to live without him, whose sprightly gait is like that of an elephant, a best one among fly-jumping Vanara-s, a courageous one, and who wears a precious and exquisite golden pendant..."" Thus Tara pleaded with Rama for a mercy-death."
Kishkindha Kanda,24,41,"Thus that way when Tara spoke to that lord and great-souled Rama, Rama consoling Tara well, spoke this word of expediency, ""oh, wife of valiant one, let not your mind go raving, the Creator decreed all the world to be in this way, isn't so!"
Kishkindha Kanda,24,42,"""And the same Creator has ordained mirth and misery , and even their association, so say sagely people. And even the triad of worlds is indeed under his control, and that triad too, cannot transgress the foreordained predestination."
Kishkindha Kanda,24,43,"""You will get paramount appeasement as before, and your son will become the crown prince, God has ordained destiny only in that way. Wives of the valiant ones will not mourn emotionally."" Thus Rama consoled Tara."
Kishkindha Kanda,24,44,"Thus consoled by that persuasive, noble-souled and enemy-burner Rama, that brave one's wife whose aspect is fair and whose attire is proper, she paused her plaint, but with a puling expression."
Kishkindha Kanda,25,1,"While a similar disquiet of Sugreeva is prevailing over Rama and Lakshmana, Rama palliatively said this to Sugreeva, and even to Tara together with Angada."
Kishkindha Kanda,25,2,"""Deceased will not derive bliss by sorrowful mourning, hence it will be appropriate to arrange for that work which is subsequent in this matter."
Kishkindha Kanda,25,3,"""Worldly observances are to be observed, thus your activity of tear-shedding this far is justifiable, but after the lapse of time of any individual, it is impossible to activate that individual by any other remote activity like weeping."
Kishkindha Kanda,25,3,"""Worldly observances are to be observed, thus your activity of tear-shedding this far is justifiable, it is impossible to undertake any other ritual work if time is lapsed just by weeping."
Kishkindha Kanda,25,4,"""Fate is the cause of all the worlds, Fate is the instrument for action, Fate is the deciding factor for motivation of all beings in these worlds."
Kishkindha Kanda,25,5,"""None is an instrument in motivating someone else to do something or otherwise, none is also a controlling entity of others, and even the world functions in its own nature, and that Time is cardinal for that world."
Kishkindha Kanda,25,6,"""Time will not transcend Time, neither Time transgresses itself, and on attaining the nature endowed by Time nothing can overstep its own Fate."
Kishkindha Kanda,25,7,"""Time has no kinship, thus it has no partiality, there is nothing instrumental to override Time, hence nothing can override it, and there are no causative factors to Time that connect through friends or relatives, hence all are equal in its viewpoint."
Kishkindha Kanda,25,8,"""But even the mutations brought forth by Time are observable by a perceiver with a clear vision, and the virtue, wealth, pleasures are to be perceived as cumulated during the course of Time."
Kishkindha Kanda,25,9,"""That king of fly-jumpers Vali departed from here on attaining his own nature of subtle-soul, and he obtained pious fruits connected with his one time actions befitting to a king like, friendliness, courteousness, and forgivingness required of a king."
Kishkindha Kanda,25,10,"""That great-souled Vali did not care to safeguard his own lives in combat, and by virtue of his own rightness of a true combatant unworried of his life, he acquired heaven."
Kishkindha Kanda,25,11,"""Which course the commander of monkeys undertook is the choicest course of fatality, and hence, enough is this sorrowing, and let works incumbent on the present time be undertaken reverently..."" So said Rama to Sugreeva."
Kishkindha Kanda,25,12,"At the close of Rama's sentence Lakshmana, the eliminator of braving foes, spoke this courteous sentence to the disconcerted Sugreeva."
Kishkindha Kanda,25,13,"""Sugreeva, you attend to the funeral rites, to be performed subsequently along with those two, Tara and Angada, and arrange for the cremation of Vali."
Kishkindha Kanda,25,14,"""Order at once for substantial dry firewood, likewise for finest sandalwood, for the purpose of the exequies of Vali."
Kishkindha Kanda,25,15,"""Bolster up that miserable Angada who is heartbroken, you too should not become frivolous in thinking as this city Kishkindha is now dependant on you."
Kishkindha Kanda,25,16,"""Let Angada bring wreaths, different cloths, ghee, oils, as well perfumes and other items that are consequently useful in funeral."
Kishkindha Kanda,25,17,"""And Lt. Tara, you go quickly and come readily fetching a palanquin of the dead, for despatch is a merit, which is truly worthwhile, especially at these times."
Kishkindha Kanda,25,18,"""Let suitable, proficient and sturdy Vaanara-s be at the ready as the bearers of the litter of the dead to carry away Vali."" Thus said Lakshmana to Sugreeva."
Kishkindha Kanda,25,19,"Speaking thus to Sugreeva that enhancer of his mother Sumitra's delight and the eliminator of braving foes, Lakshmana stepped off and stayed behind his brother Rama."
Kishkindha Kanda,25,20,On hearing the words of Lakshmana Lt. Tara's mood became hectic and he fleetly entered Kishkindha with his mood firmed up to get the litter of the dead.
Kishkindha Kanda,25,21,"Lt. Tara came back in a trice fetching that litter of the dead, getting it carried by gritty and suitable Vanara-s."
Kishkindha Kanda,25,23,"That palanquin is having a majestic throne and in similarity it is like a divine chariot which is adorned and beautified with figurines of birds and trees in high relief. From all over it is well set in with strikingly carved figures of foot soldiers, and it is like an aircraft of the gifted souls, namely siddha-s, with grills and ventilators. Well seamed-in are its parts and also spacious it is, and well crafted by the crafty craftsmen it has wooden play-hills carved in its walls, and finishing touches with a fine artistry of polishing are given to that palanquin. It is elaborated with best ornaments and strings of pearls, gems, beads and the like, and even with amazing flowery-tassels. Its cabin's roof is covered with an ornamental woodcraft of red-sandalwood. It is well covered over with lots of flowers, and in its shade it is like a tender sun, while garlands of red-lotuses are further brightening it. And Lt. Tara brought such a litter of the dead. [4-25-22, 23, 24, 25, 26]"
Kishkindha Kanda,25,27,"On seeing such a sort of palanquin Rama said to Lakshmana, ""Let Vali be taken away quickly and funeral ceremony be undertaken."""
Kishkindha Kanda,25,28,Thereafter Sugreeva along with Angada and others lifted up and then lodged Vali in the litter of the dead squalling woefully.
Kishkindha Kanda,25,26,"Thus setting that deceased Vali who is diversely decorated and adorned with garlands and cloths onto the palanquin, then Sugreeva, the king of best fly-jumpers, has ordered, ""let the funeral ceremony of this noble brother of mine be undertaken, befitting to his magnificence... [4-25-29, 30]"
Kishkindha Kanda,25,31,"""Let the vanara-s proceed in van strewing various gems plentifully, and the palanquin afterward..."
Kishkindha Kanda,25,32,"""In which way the grandiose of monarchical opulence will be conspicuous on earth when kings decease, in a similar way the Vanara-s have to immortalise lord Vali now,"" Sugreeva ordered monkeys in that way."
Kishkindha Kanda,25,29,"On performing services to the dead in the same way as ordered by Sugreeva, then all of those vanara-s like Lt. Tara and others, have promptly started out hemming round Angada, keening over their dead relative Vali. [4-25-33, 34a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,25,30,"Then all the female adherents of Vali came together and wept saying, 'oh, brave one, oh, brave one...' and they repeatedly wept thus for their departed dear. [4-25-34b, 35a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,25,31,"Lady Tara and all other female Vanara-s, whose husband is dead, followed the funeral procession wailing in a pathetic tone. [4-25-35b, 36a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,25,32,"With the din of wailing of those Vanara females in the interiors of the forest, that forest along with its hillocks appeared to be wailing noisily. [4-25-36b, 37a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,25,33,"Many Vanara-s have arranged a funeral pile on an unpopulated sandy isle, around which brooks from the cascades of hills are encircling. [4-25-37b, 38a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,25,34,"All of those best vanara-s then lifted down that palanquin from their shoulders and stood aside weltered in melancholy. [4-25-38b, 39a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,25,35,"Lady Tara on seeing at her husband Vali recumbent on the bier of the litter of the dead, she then brought his head onto her lap, and wailed painfully. [4-25-39b, 40a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,25,36,"""O, great king of monkeys... o, my consort... my dear... o, meritorious one, o, mighty one, o, my dear... see me... why do not you see this grief-stricken creature, that is me... [4-25-40b, 41]"
Kishkindha Kanda,25,42,"""Though your lives have gone your face is appearing to be highly enchanting as if it has a similar dazzle of the sun on dusking mountain, as it had when you were alive."
Kishkindha Kanda,25,43,"""Time-god in the mien of this Rama is hauling you away, oh, vanara, on rendering all of us as widows by flinging a single arrow in the fight."
Kishkindha Kanda,25,44,"""These are those female vanara-s of yours, oh, best king, unable to come by leaping and jumping as they are wont to, they have come treading a much lengthy way of yours, why do not you mind them? They with their faces like moonshine are your cherished wives, isn't it!"
Kishkindha Kanda,25,40,"""What for you are not seeing the lord of fly-jumpers Sugreeva, and these Lt. Tara and others are all your ministers, oh, king, and even the people dwelling in Kishkindha city have gathered around you and sinking down, why do not you mind them? [4-25-45b, 46]"
Kishkindha Kanda,25,47,"""Bid adieu to these ministers as usual, oh, enemy subjugator, then we all can sportfully wander in the woods in voluptuousness."" Thus Tara mourned for Vali."
Kishkindha Kanda,25,48,"While Tara is enwrapped in the grief for her husband and wailing that way, then other female Vanara-s, who are equally haggard by grief have lifted her up and took her away from the body of Vali."
Kishkindha Kanda,25,49,"Angada wailing along with Sugreeva, started to mount his father's body onto pyre in an involuntary way, as his senses are deluged under grief."
Kishkindha Kanda,25,50,"On giving fire to the pyre procedurally, then Angada with dismayed senses performed circumambulations in an anticlockwise direction to his father, who is voyaging on a remote avenue."
Kishkindha Kanda,25,51,On cremating Vali procedurally those best fly-jumpers arrived at the propitious river with auspicious waters to offer water oblations to the departed soul.
Kishkindha Kanda,25,52,"Those vanara-s on coming together along with Sugreeva and Lady Tara, and then locating Angada in their front, they have offered water oblations to the soul of Vali."
Kishkindha Kanda,25,53,"He whose sadness evened up with that of Sugreeva, and who became one with Sugreeva in haplessness, that great mighty Rama effectuated the funeral rites of Vali."
Kishkindha Kanda,25,54,"On cremating Vali of lofty aplomb and manifest-renown and whom the arrow of that Rama, the best of Ikshvaku dynasty has eliminated, Sugreeva then approached that Rama, who is with Lakshmana at his side, and whose flair equals a flaming fire."
Kishkindha Kanda,26,1,"The eminent ministers of tree-branch animals then surrounded Sugreeva, who is very much seared in grief and who is still wearing damp cloths, as he just a while ago offered watery oblations to his deceased brother, stood accessible to him."
Kishkindha Kanda,26,2,"On going towards the dexterous Rama, whose exploits are effortless, all of those monkeys tarried with their palms adjoined as with the sages tarrying in the presence of Brahma, the Forefather."
Kishkindha Kanda,26,3,"Hanuma, the son of Air-god, whose sheen is like that of the golden mountain Meru, and whose visage is like that of the tender sun in its glint, then spoke this sentence reverently adjoining his palms."
Kishkindha Kanda,26,4,"""Oh, lord Rama, this magnificent kingdom of deferential monkeys who are armed with the teeth, and whose might is a privileged one - since our might is not dependent on any weapons or other tactical warfare, except our own bodily strength - and oh, Kakutstha, that which belongs to his father and forefathers, and that which is otherwise impossible for him to regain, Sugreeva regained such a kingdom with your grace. [4-26-4, 5a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,26,5,"""And if you empower, this Sugreeva will enter the propitious city Kishkindha along with a group good-hearted friends, and he will get anointed procedurally with various essences and herbal-extracts as its king, and thus he can revamp all the administration. [4-26-5b, 6]"
Kishkindha Kanda,26,6,"""He would like to honour you in a remarkable way with garlands and precious gems, hence it will be apt of you to enter this delightful mountain cave, namely Kishkindha, and you may kindly consolidate the congenial affinity between the governor and the governed for the very high exhilaration of Vanara-s."" Hanuma appealed Rama in this way. [4-26-7, 8a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,26,7,"When Hanuma said so, Rama the destroyer of valiant foes, an intellectual and an enunciator replied Hanuma in this way. [4-26-8b, 9a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,26,8,"""As a conformist to the directives of my father, oh, gentle Hanuma, I am not supposed to enter either a village or a city. [4-26-9b, 10a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,26,9,"""As and when the best one among Vanara-s valorous Sugreeva enters the highly flourishing and statuesquely Kishkindha, he shall be enthroned in the kingdom, immediately and procedurally. [4-26-10b, 11a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,26,10,"Replying Hanuma thus, that knower of the etiquette Rama, also spoke to Sugreeva, who is rich in politesse and an imposing one by his might and valour. [4-26-11b, 12a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,26,11,"""You may even crown this brave Angada as crown prince, he is the eldest son of your elder brother, his bravery is kindred to that of his father, and thus this enthusiastic Angada will be a well-chosen designee for the crown-princeship. [4-26-12b, 13]"
Kishkindha Kanda,26,14,"""The four month period specified for rainy season has commenced, oh gentle Sugreeva, and this is shravaNa, the first month of rainy season that brings many showers."
Kishkindha Kanda,26,15,"""This is not a time for any striving, hence you enter the propitious city Kishkindha, oh, gentle Sugreeva, and I for my part will stay on this mountain along with Lakshmana."
Kishkindha Kanda,26,16,"""This mountain cave is heart-pleasing by being spacious with worthwhile breeze, oh, gentle one, water is copious and red and blue lotuses are aplenty about this place."
Kishkindha Kanda,26,15,"""On the advent of kaartika month, October, say post-rainy season, you shall do your best in the cause of Ravana's elimination, and this is our covenant, and hence oh, gentle Sugreeva, for now enter your mansion, be enthroned in kingdom as well, and exhilarate your friends."" [4-26-17, 18a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,26,16,"Thus when Rama countenanced that best vanara Sugreeva entered the charming city Kishkindha which is so far ruled by Vali. [4-26-18b, 19a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,26,17,"When the sovereign of vanara-s Sugreeva has entered the city, very gladly thousands of vanara-s have also entered and fenced off that lord of fly-jumpers from all over. [4-26-19b, 20a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,26,18,"All the inmates and ministers in Kishkindha then revered the lord of monkey throngs Sugreeva with their head-bent, and they have also prostrated before him with an assiduously polite attitude. [4-26-20b, 21a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,26,19,"Raising the rank-and-file members from their prostration, and on exchanging a word or two with them, that valiant and highly mighty Sugreeva entered the beautiful palace-chambers of his brother. [4-26-21b, 22a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,26,20,"When that prodigiously venturesome arch-vanara Sugreeva has entered the palace his cohorts anointed him as gods would anoint the Thousand-eyed Indra. [4-26-22b, 23a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,26,21,"A white parasol highly ornate in gold, long-furred royal-fans with golden handles that are the enhancers of celebrity are brought for Sugreeva's anointment. Likewise, on taking all kinds of jewels, seeds, herbs, sprouts of trees that are still exuding milky latex, also flowers, and white royal-robes and white body-cream, lotuses bloomed on dry-land, best sandal paste, also various and numerous perfumes, Holy-yellow-rice, gold, seeds that are small and fragrant called priyangu, honey, ghee, curds, skin of tiger, tassels of fragrant flowers, and invaluable sandal shoes, unguents before oil bath, orpiment preparations one in yellow called gorochana, and the other in red called Manshila, there arrived sixteen best and cheerful damsels. [4-26-23b, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28]"
Kishkindha Kanda,26,29,"They the Vanara-s have then started to anoint that best Vanara Sugreeva according to the tradition, having appeased the eminent Brahmans with jewels, garments and delicacies."
Kishkindha Kanda,26,30,Authoritative scholars in Vedic-hymns then spreading the ritual grass around the Fire-altar which is with enkindled Ritual-fire oblated fire oblations into it duly sanctifying them with hymns.
Kishkindha Kanda,26,24,"On a splendid, choicest and finely upholstered throne with golden legs that is kept atop a rostrum that is shining forth with various flower tassels, Sugreeva is procedurally inducted to sit facing east to the chanting of Vedic hymns. Then, Vanara-s like Gaja, Gavaaksha, Gavaya, Sharabha, Gandhamaadana, Mainda, Dvividha, also thus Hanuma, Jambavanta have started pouring pure water on Sugreeva, which the best vanara-s have collected from the rivers flowing to east, as well as to west, from each of the sacred-declivity of rivers, from every ocean, and stored in golden flasks. Thus those have anointed Sugreeva with those pellucid and well-perfumed waters poured from golden vessels through the auspicious horns of bulls as revealed in scriptures and as great sages have defined, which anointment is like eight of Vasu-gods anointing the Thousand-eyed Indra. [4-26-31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36]"
Kishkindha Kanda,26,37,"Hundreds and thousands of the great-souled and prominent vanara-s that are there, all of them have cheerily raised high hullabaloos while Sugreeva is anointed."
Kishkindha Kanda,26,38,The best one among monkeys Sugreeva graciously embraced Angada and anointed his as crown prince in order to effectuate Rama's word.
Kishkindha Kanda,26,39,"On the anointment of Angada those fly-jumpers that have sympathy for him have acclaimed Sugreeva saying, 'well done, well done.'"
Kishkindha Kanda,26,40,"While that kind of pompous anointment is taking place all are gladdened and that way they repeatedly extolled the great-souled Rama, and even Lakshmana too."
Kishkindha Kanda,26,41,That magnificent city Kishkindha situated in the cave of mountain which is already splendorous with flags of triumph and banners is further splendorous with blithe and burly monkeys overspreading it.
Kishkindha Kanda,26,42,"The valiant Sugreeva who is by now the king of monkeys army, then apprised the great-souled Rama about his grand anointment, and thus he not only regained his wife Ruma but also secured the kingdom, like the chief of divinities Indra."
Kishkindha Kanda,27,1,"The readers familiar with critical edition may find only twenty-three verses in that edition, whereas this traditional version contains forty-eight of them. Twenty-five verses that account the names of trees, river-flows, beauty of nature etc., extolling nature are here as an ingredient of epical literature that aim to remind us about the need for a good environment, rather than to worry about global warming, ozone depletion, deforestation etc."
Kishkindha Kanda,27,1,Rama along with his brother Lakshmana reached Mt. Prasavana while the enthroned Sugreeva entered the cave-city Kishkindha.
Kishkindha Kanda,27,3,"Mt. Prasavana is pervaded with noisily growling tigers and beasts, mightily roaring lions, compacted with diverse shrubs and creeper-plants, overspread with many a kind of tree, thus it is adored by bears, monkeys, baboons, and even by wildcats, and that mountain which is always sanctifying and tranquil is like a heap of clouds in its shine. [4-27-2, 3]"
Kishkindha Kanda,27,4,Rama along with Lakshmana has taken up an ample spaced cave as residence on the cliff of that mountain.
Kishkindha Kanda,27,5,"Rama, the faultless one and the elder brother of Lakshmana, who is the delight of Raghu's dynasty, and who made an accord with Sugreeva regarding cessation of activity during rainy season, spoke these significant and timely words to his humble brother Lakshmana who is the enhancer of prosperity.

Kishkindha Kanda,27,6,"""This delightful mountain cave is spacious and breezy, hence, oh, enemy destroyer Soumitri, let us stay in this during rainy nights."
Kishkindha Kanda,27,7,"""This admirable peak of mountain is embellished with white, black and coppery rock faces, oh, prince, thus this is fully overspread with diverse ores. Bristling with rivers and frogs, and brimmed with clumps of various trees along with beautiful and amazing creeper-plants it is elaborated. It is highly reverberated with diverse birds and filled with the screeches of best peacocks. And bloomed Maalati and Jasmine bushes, also trees like Sindhuvara, Shirrishika, further the trees like Kadamba, Arjuna, and Sarja in bloom, are brightening it and it is delightful.

Kishkindha Kanda,27,14,"""With the trees born on the riverbank and available here and there in various shapes, like Vaaniira, Timida, Vakula, Ketaka, and with Hintaala, Tinisha, Niipa, Vetasa, Kritamaala trees, that river is brightened up, and thus that river appears as a dame finely bedecked with raiment and ornaments.

Kishkindha Kanda,27,15,"""This river is fairly resonated with the calls of diverse birds in hundreds of flights, beautified with ruddy gees that are doting one upon the other, and admired by the swans and cranes upon her highly appealing sand-isles, thus she appears to be a damsel decorated with jewels with a toothy grin.

Kishkindha Kanda,27,27,"""The melodies of singing and the tunes of musical instruments played and sung in Kishkindha are heard from here, oh, the best-triumphant Lakshmana, and even the blares of vanara-s together with their snobbish drumming is heard, hence it is not far away."
Kishkindha Kanda,27,28,"""It is definite that the best monkey Sugreeva must be surrounded by his friends, thus he must be exuberant, as he won an utmost prosperity in winning back his wife and winning the kingdom."" Rama thus spoke to Lakshmana."
Kishkindha Kanda,27,29,"Raghava having said thus resided on that Mt. Prasavana along with Lakshmana, whereat many sightly caves and arbours are there."
Kishkindha Kanda,27,30,"Though that mountain is indeed very comfortable, though it possess many objects of nature like flowers, fruits and waters, indeed, there is no slightest bliss to Rama while he resided there."
Kishkindha Kanda,27,31,"He felt despondent in reminiscing about his wife who is loftier that his lives, but who is kidnapped, especially on seeing the moon just risen on the eastern mountain."
Kishkindha Kanda,27,32,"That anguish which is surging high in him has rendered him with a bosom marred with tears, thereby sleep has no effect on him even if he has gone to bed in nights."
Kishkindha Kanda,27,33,"While pacifying Rama who is pensive and who is always subjected to grief, his brother Lakshmana who is similarly sad for his brother's sadness spoke these words."
Kishkindha Kanda,27,34,"""Oh, brave one, enough is this anguishing of yours, and it will be inapt of you to dishearten. All objectives will backslide for them who will be ceaselessly anguishing. That you know clearly."
Kishkindha Kanda,27,29,"""Oh, Raghava, in the world you are a result-oriented person, and a devotee of gods for achieving those desired results, you are the theist, moralist, and also the mobilizer."
Kishkindha Kanda,27,35,"""You are the only master in all the worlds to undertake certain tasks, and for achieving results of those humanly actions of yours you worship god, leaving the fruits of your action in god... you will do your duty as ordained... you are a theist, for you alone are tat 'that' 'Supreme Person...' thus you cannot self-contradict yourself to behave only in a humanly attitude... and then you are bound to be a moralist for you have all the preceding attributes... you alone are the mobilizer, for none other can accomplish certain tasks for which you are mobilised by all the divinities and you have also come this far..."
Kishkindha Kanda,27,36,"""If you are much too lackadaisical, indeed, you will not be capable to eliminate the enemy in war, specially a demon, especially a trickster, let alone all of your daring enterprises."
Kishkindha Kanda,27,37,"""On completely rooting out that agony then you stabilise your endeavour, and then you will be able to eliminate that demon Ravana along with his followers."
Kishkindha Kanda,27,38,"""Oh, Kakutstha, you are capable to inverse the order of earth along with all of its oceans, forests, and mountains, then what to speak of that Ravana, all the more."
Kishkindha Kanda,27,39,"""Look forward to the autumnal season, as this season that has come is of heavy rains, and thereafter, you will eradicate that Ravana along with his city-state and his followers."
Kishkindha Kanda,27,40,"""I am just awakening the fast sleeping vitality of yours, no more than rekindling fire concealed under embers with the timely offerings of flammable fire-oblations."" Thus said Lakshmana to Rama."
Kishkindha Kanda,27,41,"Honouring that expedient and propitious advise of Lakshmana, Raghava spoke this sentence to that good-hearted and good-natured Lakshmana."
Kishkindha Kanda,27,42,"""What is to be said by an affectionate, amiable and cordial person, also whose courage is truth itself, that you have said it, Lakshmana."
Kishkindha Kanda,27,43,"""Yes! Distress is retrogressive to all the functions. I am casting-off this distress completely. As an undefeatable one in my triumphs I am invigorating my ebullience."
Kishkindha Kanda,27,44,"""Awaiting for the kind-heartedness of Sugreeva, and for the kindness of the rivers in their abatement, I look forward for the autumn remaining true to your words."
Kishkindha Kanda,27,45,"""A valiant one who is succoured will be indebted with some requital on his part, but besides being unfaithful, if one who does not make requital for all the favours done in his interest, he will be wounding the hearts of soft-hearted people."" Rama said so to Lakshmana, keeping Sugreeva in view."
Kishkindha Kanda,27,46,"Visualising what Rama said about their waiting for pre-winter season to be candid, and praisefully making palm-fold at that determination of Rama, and even to clarify his own opportune viewpoint, Lakshmana spoke to Rama who by his own aspect is a delightful one for a ken."
Kishkindha Kanda,27,47,"""Oh, lord of people, Sugreeva will be effectuating everything you have desired and said, not later but soon, hence awaiting autumn you may please bear up these heavy rainfalls, besides bearing with the idea of disciplining the enemy."
Kishkindha Kanda,27,48,"""Let autumn be awaited while containing your anger, and along with me you may stay on this mountain which is adored by lions, and spend these four rainy months here like a monsoon lion, although you are capable to eliminate the enemy at any moment like a lion."

Kishkindha Kanda,28,6,"""Slothful breezes as her sighs, sunset tingeing her as sandal paste, the sky with blanched clouds on her face appears like the one sighing for love."
Kishkindha Kanda,28,7,"""Overly agonised with the searing-summer, but thoroughly wetted with new waters, this earth looks like Seetha, both implacably outpouring tears."
Kishkindha Kanda,28,8,"""Freed from the wombs of clouds, cool as the leaves of minty-camphor, perfumed with the fragrance of Mogra plants, such as these breezes are it is possible to have a draught of them with the bowl of palms."

Kishkindha Kanda,28,12,"""That lightning hingeing on the blue cloud is squirmy, to me it appears like woeful Vaidehi squirming in the grasp of Ravana."
Kishkindha Kanda,28,13,"""For those who are with their beloveds these precincts are advantageous, as their directions, as to which east and which is west, are unclear; and to loverless ones like me they are disadvantageous, because the same precincts have their planets and even their moon lost, and they look as though begrimed with dark-clouds."
Kishkindha Kanda,28,14,"""Feeling happy with the arrival of rain wild jasmine plants standing somewhere on the terraces of mountain are flowered, and they are thickly covered with droplets of vapour, as if they are the tears of happiness hovering round the flower like faces of ladyloves at the arrival of their lovers, and such plants are becoming inciters of passion in me, who am let down by my sorrow for my ladylove."
Kishkindha Kanda,28,15,"""In these days the dust is quietened, breeze is chilly, vile pervasions of summer are also quietened, conquests of kings indeed came to a halt, and the people in outstation are returning to their own countries."
Kishkindha Kanda,28,16,"""Presently swans have started journey to Lake Manasa eager to live there, but the Cakravaka birds, ruddy gees, that are together with their beloveds are not departing, and vehicles are not taking to road as the rainwater has battered the roadways oftentimes."
Kishkindha Kanda,28,17,"""Widely bestrewn with clouds the sky is bright somewhere, and not so bright somewhere else, thus it is gleaming well with an aspect of vast but tideless ocean that is by far dammed up with cloudlike mountains."
Kishkindha Kanda,28,18,"""Coalesced with Sarja and Wild-jasmine flowers, and also with the coppery ores of the mountain, the new waters are swiftly transiting towards ocean, while screams of peacocks haunting them."

Kishkindha Kanda,28,26,"""Interiors of forests have become adaptive for the peacocks to dance very well, Kadamba trees have become adaptive to their branches and bouquets, bulls with matching sensualities became adaptive to cows, and adaptive is this earth with its enrapturing crops and orchards, and all are adaptive to the season's gaiety."
Kishkindha Kanda,28,27,"""Rivers are surging, clouds are showering, rutty elephants are shrilling, forest interiors are shining, loverless are speculating, and peacocks are rocking, monkeys are resolving to stay at one place, for this is the rainy season."
Kishkindha Kanda,28,28,"""On whiffing the fragrance of new Ketaka flowers the lordly elephants are highly joyous and became excited, but they are baffled at the sounds made by the fall of water in the streamlets of forest, and those best ruttish elephants are blaring along with screaming peacocks."

Kishkindha Kanda,28,32,"""That energetic and lordly elephant which readily started going towards the forest minding the track of that mountain, heard the thundering of the cloud, and doubting it a the war-whoop of another elephant took a right about turn wishing for a head-on collision with it."
Kishkindha Kanda,28,33,"""Somewhere the interiors of forests are finely singing, in affect, as they have swarms of singing honeybees; elsewhere, they are richly dancing, practically, as the purple-necked peacocks are bestirring; somewhere else, they are highly excited, virtually, as lordly elephants are highly excited, thus the interiors of forests are beaming forth as retreats to many bees, birds and animals."
Kishkindha Kanda,28,34,"""Plentiful in Kadamba, Sarja, Arjuna, Kandala trees and with the heaps of their reddish flowers fallen on ground, and well-excited peacocks screaming and dancing like the tipplers of that liquor like nectar, thus the interiors of forest are aplenty with nectar of those fallen flowers flowing like water, thus they are impressively similar to the lands of liquor, say watering-holes."

Kishkindha Kanda,28,38,"""Thunders of clouds called up the frogs, and casting off their long-time captivity in sleep, frogs of various casts, carves, colours and crocks are crocking scourged heavily by the streams of new waters."
Kishkindha Kanda,28,39,"""Prideful rivers are swiftly surging near and near of their lover-like ocean overflowing their own battered riverbanks, and in doing so they are swinging and seesawing flights of ruddy gees flying on their bosom, where the curvatures of bird-flight look like the new, full-fledged, seducible, nubile breasts of the river, and in doing so the river is also lugging other items of romance, namely flowers and fruits, steeped in their new waters."

Kishkindha Kanda,28,43,"""In forests lordly elephants are ruttish, ideal bulls that are delighted, peerless lions are triumphant to a better degree, lofty mountains are heart-pleasant, lords of people are withdrawing from their campaigns, and the lord of gods, Indra, is playing well with water giving clouds."
Kishkindha Kanda,28,44,"""The clouds having torrential water are soaring the sky, and spurning the booms of oceans with their rumbles they are inundating rivers, lakes, pools, tanks and even the earth."

Kishkindha Kanda,28,46,"""Lords of people will be anointed by people with water carried in pots on their shoulders, and then those kings show their propitious aspect of a humanly king with applied divinity, whereas the lords of mountains are being anointed with the water sent directly by Indra and hitherto wafted straight by Air-god in the pots called black-clouds, thus these lordly mountains are standing alone as if showing their grandeur and divinity on earth."
Kishkindha Kanda,28,47,"""Sky is closely enshrouded with clouds, neither sun nor stars are getting around for a glimpse, earth is fully satiated with the torrents of new water, enswathed in obscurity the precincts are unilluminated..."

Kishkindha Kanda,30,12,"""The Love-god with a plethora of provocative autumnal features will be prolongedly agonising her, because she is separated from me, and because her ladyship is a frailty - won't he?"" Thus Rama worried for Seetha."
Kishkindha Kanda,30,13,"So on and so forth that best one among men and the son of a king keened over, like a Rain-cuckoo which will be keen on Indra, the king of divinities, for rainy-water."
Kishkindha Kanda,30,14,Meandering on the pleasant mountain-terraces in search of fruits brilliant Lakshmana returned and has seen his elder brother Rama.
Kishkindha Kanda,30,15,"Noble-hearted Saumitri, on observing lone Rama in a lonely place, who is beset with unbearable sadness and whose posture is vacuous, became very miserable for the sad condition of his brother, and spoke to Rama fretfully."
Kishkindha Kanda,30,16,"""Oh, noble one, what is the use in getting into fetters of passion, what for soul's bold-temper is being trounced, this remorseful sadness is arrogating self-assurance, and what purpose can be achieved now in retracing steps from the goal."
Kishkindha Kanda,30,17,"""Oh, dear sir, engage yourself in your mission with an undeterred spirit and with a good disposition of mind, and bring time under control with steadfastness and ideation, and the capabilities of your helpmates, say Sugreeva and others be gathered, and the basis for your achievements, say daily rituals towards gods, be performed by you as your means."
Kishkindha Kanda,30,18,"""Oh, the lord of human kindred, with you as her husband Janaki is not an easily attainable one for others, oh, highly honourable one, if it is said that none will be burnt if he nears the tongues of flaming fire, oh, brave one, it is not so, for Janaki is a flaming fire, and anyone nearing her in ill-will will be burnt to ashes like a grass-hopper."" Thus Lakshmana said to Rama."
Kishkindha Kanda,30,18,"Lakshmana with his seemliness spoke those undeniable and expedient words that emerged from his very nature, which are tasteful, morally abiding, and further abounding with friendliness, righteousness, and meaningfulness, and on listening such words Rama spoke to Lakshmana."
Kishkindha Kanda,30,19,"Rama spoke to seemly and undeniable Lakshmana with words that emerged from his very nature, which are tasteful, morally abiding, and further abounding with friendliness, righteousness, and meaningfulness."
Kishkindha Kanda,30,20,"""Doubtless accomplishment of the task is to be held in view, even oh, boy, the factors that contribute to its accomplishment, like enthusiasm, helpmates etc., are to be followed through, and not only these aspects but we also have to observe the fruition of task when that task is becoming unwieldy, unattainable and formidable, along with the lapse of time and lapsing of help."" Thus Rama said to Lakshmana."
Kishkindha Kanda,30,21,"On thinking about the fruit of his mammoth task, namely that lotus-petal-eyed Maithili, thereafter Rama spoke to Lakshmana with a dried-up face."
Kishkindha Kanda,30,22,"""On satisfying mother earth with rainwater and on effectuating the crops on earth, the Thousand-eyed Indra is complacent as his task is effectuated, whereas my task is yet to take off."

Kishkindha Kanda,30,30,"""The breeze is wafting the fragrance of flowers of seven-leaved banana plants, and the swarms of honeybees that are singing in accompaniment to the rustle of breeze are tagging along that breeze for its fragrance, and because that breeze is breezing unceasingly, that alone is fetching the pride of rut for the already rutted elephants, and thus this autumnal season is highly glistening."

Kishkindha Kanda,30,34,"""Umpteen are those Priyaka trees with their pleasingly fragrant flowers, the apices of the boughs of those trees are sagging down by their much weighty flowers-bunches, and eye-delighting is the golden-yellow hue of those flowers, and with them the interiors of these forests look as though illuminated, lit with golden lamps."
Kishkindha Kanda,30,35,"""On scenting the fragrance of the seven-leaved banana plants, the ruttish lather of those best elephants that have a fond for forests and lotus-lakes has started to flow on their temples, thus they are indulgent in rut and their strides are slackening while they are moving along with their beloved female elephants."
Kishkindha Kanda,30,36,"""The sky is clear as with the tinge of just whetted weapon, lessened are the flows of river-waters, breeze is chilly while wafting the chillness of red-lotuses, and all the directions released from the darkness are looking bright."
Kishkindha Kanda,30,37,"""Overcome by the sun's heat dried out is the sludge, at last the earth is dense with the up-heaved dust, and for the lords of people who have mutual animosity this is the time to foregather their forces to strive against one another."

Kishkindha Kanda,30,40,"""The excellent plumaged-tails that form their individual ornaments of peacocks are now cast out, and the plumeless peacocks on nearing the banks of rivers they look as if intimidated by the Saarasa birds, thus they had to turn back despondently and dispiritedly."

Kishkindha Kanda,30,78,"""But on promising to get back after rainy season that king of vanara-s is insensible to the slipping away of those four months time of rainy season, for he is wallowing in his pleasures."
Kishkindha Kanda,30,79,"""Frolicking with all in the council of ministers Sugreeva is absorbed in drinking alone, and he is not sympathising with us who are agonised by grief."
Kishkindha Kanda,30,80,"""Oh, great-mighty Lakshmana, you may proceed to Kishkindha and let Sugreeva know through you as to how my fury takes shape, and oh, brave one, he may be told this word also."

Kishkindha Kanda,30,84,""" 'Oh, king of monkeys, on apperceiving the perpetual virtuousness in what you have promised to me, render it as a reality. Otherwise, now driven by my arrows to death, and on going to Yama, the Time-god's Inferno, you will see Vali "" Thus Rama appraised Lakshmana about his thinking of Sugreeva."
Kishkindha Kanda,30,85,"On clearly examining his elder brother Rama, who has become ruthlessly uncompassionate and pitiably prating, the mood of that intensively resplendent Lakshmana, who is an augmenter of Manu's dynasty, has become hostile towards the monkey-king Sugreeva."
Kishkindha Kanda,31,1,"When Rama of undeterred stamina has become pitiable while yearning for Seetha, overcome with grief while the search for Seetha is becoming futile, overwrought with anger while Sugreeva is reneging on his promise, to such an elder prince-brother from a godlike king, his younger prince-brother Lakshmana spoke in this way."
Kishkindha Kanda,31,2,"""As a forester Sugreeva will not abide by the conduct of gentlefolk, he is not appreciative of the fruits of incidental events like gaining kingdom and regaining wife occurring out of your deed of eliminating Vali, thus he will not enjoy the prosperity of the kingdom anymore. Obviously his prudence is behindhand, isn't it!"
Kishkindha Kanda,31,3,"""Without any notion of requiting the beneficence you have accorded he is insanely involved in primitive pleasures, such as he is, let him see his elder brother Vali when slain. Hence, kingdoms are unaffordable to dishonest."
Kishkindha Kanda,31,4,"""Unbearable is this anger that is tiding quickly, now I shall kill that unfaithful Sugreeva and the best braving monkeys shall search for that princess Seetha, remaining under the command of Vali's son, Angada."" Thus said Lakshmana to Rama."
Kishkindha Kanda,31,5,"Rama, the slayer of braving enemies, spoke this well thought sentence that includes persuasiveness to Lakshmana who is with an irrepressible wartime anger, who has apprised his intention to slay Sugreeva, and who on taking his bow is now leaping at Kishkindha."
Kishkindha Kanda,31,6,"""Certainly none of your kind shall commit this sort of sin in this world, and if such a situation occurs, he who by his noble gesture kills his own anger is a valorous one, and he really becomes the best one among men."" Thus Rama is saying to Lakshmana."
Kishkindha Kanda,31,7,"""Lakshmana, as person with righteous conduct you are not supposed to understand this matter in this way, or undertake in this way, but you are supposed to adhere to those aspects of friendliness with Sugreeva and the affinity earlier existed in dealing with him."
Kishkindha Kanda,31,8,"""It will be apt of you to speak to that reneger Sugreeva with placating words rather than with caustic remarks, as his sin is no more than flouting the timeframe."" Thus Rama said to Lakshmana."
Kishkindha Kanda,31,9,"That brave one and the slayer of braving enemies Lakshmana thus schooled expediently by his elder brother about the means of gainfulness, that best one among men proceeded to enter the city of Kishkindha."
Kishkindha Kanda,31,10,"That right-minded and well-informed Lakshmana who is bent on doing only that which is agreeable and beneficial to his elder brother, then swallowing his exasperation and wielding a bow which is shining forth like the bow of Indra, and which is standing out like a peaking mountain proceeded towards the palace of the monkey, namely Sugreeva, and with such a bow he appeared to be the peaking Mt. Mandhara and like the Era-Ender. [4-31-10, 11]"
Kishkindha Kanda,31,11,"Lakshmana the non-defying adherer of Rama, a coequal of Brihaspati-Jupiter, in intelligence, then mulled over the exact words of Rama to be spoken to Sugreeva, possible reply of Sugreeva on them, and his own sensible counter-reply to them, enwrapped as he is in a furious fire fired up by the desire of Rama for Seetha, proceeded to Sugreeva's palace like an embittered whirlwind aided and abetted by a furious fire. [4-31-12, 13]"
Kishkindha Kanda,31,15,"While knocking down Saala, Palm, Ashvakarna trees with his might, razing mountain-crests and even other trees with his strength, splintering boulders underfoot, Lakshmana made haste through an enmeshed path leaving off one-foot-pathway as with an elephant striding fleetly, and proceeded swiftly impelled by the mission."
Kishkindha Kanda,31,16,"Entrenched among mountains, impregnated with vanara-army is the magnificent citadel of the king of monkeys, and the tigerly-Ikshvaku, Lakshmana, has seen such an impassable city, namely Kishkindha."
Kishkindha Kanda,31,17,"While his lips are quivering owing to rancour towards Sugreeva, Lakshmana saw formidable Vaanara-s at the outposts of Kishkindha."
Kishkindha Kanda,31,18,"On seeing the most notable one among men, Lakshmana all of the elephantine vanara-s available in the gorges of mountain have grabbed hundreds of mountain-crests and gigantic trees, and they are at the ready."
Kishkindha Kanda,31,19,"But on seeing all of them handling assaultive peaks and trees, Lakshmana's fury has become twofold as with a fire to which much fuel is added."
Kishkindha Kanda,31,20,"On seeing overexcited Lakshmana who is like the Time-god and the Epoch-Ender, troops and troops of those fly-jumpers quickly fled away in all directions with scare coiling their bodies."
Kishkindha Kanda,31,21,"Then on entering the palace of Sugreeva, some best ones among monkeys have appraised about the arrival of Lakshmana, and even about his fury."
Kishkindha Kanda,31,22,"At that time, he who is in a lustful mood, who is in the company of Lady Tara and who is enmired in privacy, that foremost monkey Sugreeva is unheedful of the words of those bold monkeys who brought the message."
Kishkindha Kanda,31,23,"Then, as directed by ministers of Kishkindha in order to figure out the mood of Lakshmana, some of the elephantine monkeys who are frightening just by their appearance, who in sheen are similar to mountains and dark-clouds have gone out of the city."
Kishkindha Kanda,31,24,"All of those brave vanara-s are armed with their own teeth and nails, all are with tigerish pride, all are hideous in look and horrendous by their faces."
Kishkindha Kanda,31,25,"Some of those vanara-s are with the might of ten elephants, some ten times more, and some with vigour matching that of a thousand elephants."
Kishkindha Kanda,31,26,"Infuriated Lakshmana has then seen Kishkindha, an unassailable city, as those great-mighty monkeys flaunting trees are spreading throughout it."
Kishkindha Kanda,31,27,"All of those monkeys then exiting from the inside of the compound-wall of the castle and coming underneath of the iron-latches of the castle's gateway, they became visible and stood up to Lakshmana with their ebullient might."
Kishkindha Kanda,31,28,"On envisaging Sugreeva's blunder and of his elder-brother's expediency, that sensible one and fury restrained Lakshmana, again went into the restraint of fury on seeing the monkeys."
Kishkindha Kanda,31,29,"With his long, fiery, and endless exhales and eyes bloodshot in fury, that tigerly-man Lakshmana is like a fuming fire."
Kishkindha Kanda,31,30,"Lakshmana has become identical to a five-faced serpent as his curvi-bow looked like the curvi-hood of a serpent, arrowheads looked like the poking tongues of the serpent, and as his own fervency is proliferating as that serpent's venom."
Kishkindha Kanda,31,31,"Angada succumbing to high despair caused by the scare neared Lakshmana who is aglow like the Fire of Perdition and like aadi seSa, the Thousand-hooded King of Serpents, who is perforce infuriated."
Kishkindha Kanda,31,32,"With his eyes reddened in rancour that highly adorable Lakshmana sent a word through Angada, saying ""oh, boy, let Sugreeva be informed about my arrival,"" and said this way."
Kishkindha Kanda,31,30,"""Oh, enemy-destroyer Angada, oh, boy, you may say these words to Sugreeva, 'oh, enemy-destroyer Sugreeva, distressed by the distress of his brother this Lakshmana has arrived in your presence and waiting at the door, oh, Sugreeva, the vanara, if you are interested it will be apt of you to listen to his advise, either by coming here or inviting him inside...' saying so oh, boy Angada, you comeback quickly."" Thus Lakshmana spoke to Angada. [4-31-33, 34]"
Kishkindha Kanda,31,35,"On hearing the words of Lakshmana Angada is muffled up in grief, and on arriving in the presence of his father Sugreeva he informed ""Soumitri has come."""
Kishkindha Kanda,31,36,"Bewildered in his perception at the very sharp words of Lakshmana, mighty Angada then has gone to the palace assuming a very sad face, and there he firstly saluted the feet of his father Sugreeva and then at the feet of Ruma, wife of Sugreeva."
Kishkindha Kanda,31,37,"Angada whose vitality is intense clinched himself to the feet of his father Sugreeva, and later clung to the feet of his mother Tara, and he even clasped the feet of his paternal-aunt Ruma, and latching on to the feet of his parents then he stated to appeal to them about the message of Lakshmana."
Kishkindha Kanda,31,38,"Sugreeva, the vanara, who is bound up in drowsiness and dizziness could not comprehend clearly what Angada is talking about, as he is benumbed with intoxication, and even numbed down with the torpor of lustfulness."
Kishkindha Kanda,31,39,"The hearts of mobbing monkeys are flustered with fear when they pored over infuriated Lakshmana, thus they jibber-jabbered so as to appease him."
Kishkindha Kanda,31,40,"And those monkeys on observing Lakshmana instantly raised a hubbub at his nearby that is similar to a storm of a torrent, thunder of a thunderbolt, and the roar of a lion."
Kishkindha Kanda,31,41,"With that uproarious noise of monkeys Sugreeva came to his senses, but because of stupor his coppery eyes are helter-skelter and his garlands and ornaments are topsy-turvy."
Kishkindha Kanda,31,38,"On hearing the words of Angada two ministers who are agreeable in their advice and appreciable in their aspect have come along with him, and those two ministers of the king of vanara-s, namely Plaksha and Prabhava, have appraised Sugreeva that Lakshmana has arrived to discuss variously about the prosperity and probity. [4-31-42, 43]"
Kishkindha Kanda,31,44,"Those two ministers sitting around and nearby Sugreeva, who is seated like the king of wind-gods, namely Indra, on appeasing him with meaningful and expressive words they spoke to him in this way."
Kishkindha Kanda,31,45,"""Rama and Lakshmana are the brothers who abide by truth, highly-providential, and though they are worthy enough to rule kingdom for themselves they have bestowed the kingdom to you, such as they are, they have become your true friends."" Thus started the ministers to say to Sugreeva."
Kishkindha Kanda,31,46,"""One among those two, Lakshmana, is biding at the door wielding his bow, by whom the monkeys are panicked and venting out alarms shuddering utterly."
Kishkindha Kanda,31,47,"""This Lakshmana, the brother of Raghava, has arrived here at the decree of Rama on the chariot called his 'endeavour', charioted by the charioteer called 'the word of Rama.'"
Kishkindha Kanda,31,48,"""Oh, merited one, even Lakshmana has ushered this Angada hastily, oh, king, the precious son of Tara, to your presence."
Kishkindha Kanda,31,49,"""Oh, king of monkeys, such as he is, that brave Lakshmana is sticking fast at the door with an awning of rancour on his eyes and as if to burn down the monkeys just with his eyes."
Kishkindha Kanda,31,50,"""You may approach him quickly along with your son and relatives, oh, great-king, prostrate yourself before him holding him in reverence, and thus let his bitterness be indeed pacified now."
Kishkindha Kanda,31,51,"""Whatever that virtue-souled Rama says that you have to implement wholeheartedly, oh, king, you abide by the forthrightness of your promise, stick up for the pact you made."" Thus the ministers advised Sugreeva."
Kishkindha Kanda,32,1,"On hearing the words of Angada along with those of his ministers, namely Hanuma, Plaksha, and Prabhava et al, also on knowing that Lakshmana is angered, that sensible Sugreeva stirred from seat."
Kishkindha Kanda,32,2,"On discriminating the pros and cons Sugreeva spoke this sentence to the strategist-ministers, for he himself is an expert in strategies and a diligent one in carrying out those strategies."
Kishkindha Kanda,32,3,"""I have not in the least spoken any ill of them, nor committed any misdeed in their respect, thus I am thinking why should Raghava's brother Lakshmana take offence at me?"
Kishkindha Kanda,32,4,"""Unsympathetic rivals of mine, who will always be snoopy for scope, might have ear-filled Raghava's brother about the fabricated faults of mine."
Kishkindha Kanda,32,5,"""In this situation, all of you on your part and according to your perspectives have to find out firstly and meticulously about the attitude of Lakshmana, along with a steady but diligent determination thereof."
Kishkindha Kanda,32,6,"""Definitely there is no fear for me from Lakshmana, not even from Raghava, but an unfounded ire of a friend alone is giving rise to disquiet."
Kishkindha Kanda,32,7,"""It is always practicable to befriend any, but in turn it is impracticable to manage that friendship, even a trifle splits off that friendliness for sentiments are transient."
Kishkindha Kanda,32,8,"""On that score I am flustering because of the noble-souled Rama, and I cannot possibly requite the favour that has been done to me."" So said Sugreeva to his ministers."
Kishkindha Kanda,32,9,"While Sugreeva is saying that way, the eminent-monkey Hanuma spoke with a dint of his own expediency, from among the Vanara ministers."
Kishkindha Kanda,32,10,"""In any case, it is not astonishing to say, oh, king of monkey troops, that you with a deep regard have not forgotten the advantageous help rendered to you, since it is natural for you."
Kishkindha Kanda,32,11,"""On his part Raghava tossed off his fear distantly and eliminated Vali, whose valour equals that of Indra, only to fulfil your cherish."
Kishkindha Kanda,32,12,"""Anywise, by virtue of his friendliness with you Raghava must be annoyed, hence he must have expedited his brother Lakshmana, whose disposition in effect to is enhance prosperity."
Kishkindha Kanda,32,13,"""You have become ecstatic, oh, the best of the best timekeepers, hence you are unaware of the slippage of time, but the sedate and dark-green autumn on its part is underway unfolding dark-green leaves canopying seven-leaved banana plants."
Kishkindha Kanda,32,14,"""Clear is the sky with its planets and stars as clouds have vanished on it, even all the ten directions are clear, and the rivers and lakes too are equable."
Kishkindha Kanda,32,15,"""Because the time for campaigns has chanced, oh, the ablest monkey, and because you were very slumberous you have not got the drift of it, as such Lakshmana must have come here, and it is obvious."
Kishkindha Kanda,32,16,"""Raghava's bitter words are endurable by you as he is primarily an anguished person, further he is the one whose is wife is abducted, and furthermore he is magnanimous in giving kingdom to you, besides, he is reproachful through another person, namely Lakshmana."
Kishkindha Kanda,32,17,"""Indeed, I do not foresee any other appropriate means for you, as a blunder is committed by you, other than seeking Lakshmana's pardon duly adjoining your palms."
Kishkindha Kanda,32,18,"""A king is to be advised beneficially and unhesitatingly by the minister designates, that is why I am speaking what I hold fast discarding fear."
Kishkindha Kanda,32,19,"""If Raghava is highly infuriated he is capable to keep the world under his control along with gods, demons, gandharva-s just on hitching up his bow, isn't it!"
Kishkindha Kanda,32,20,"""It becomes unseemly to infuriate him who is to be placated time and again, especially when remembering his earlier beneficence to you and when you are beholden to him."
Kishkindha Kanda,32,21,"""Prostrate yourself before him along with your son, friends and relatives to pay deference, oh, king, and abide by your own accord you made with him remaining under his auspices, like a wife abiding in the care of her husband."
Kishkindha Kanda,32,22,"""It will be unseemly to fend off the ruling of Rama, or of his brother Lakshmana even in your imagination, oh, king of monkeys, as your heart is aware of the humanly tenacity of that Rama, whose resplendence vies with that of Indra, and who is associated with selfsame Lakshmana, isn't it."" Thus Hanuma spoke to Sugreeva."
Kishkindha Kanda,33,1,"This chapter vies with the 33rd chapter of Aranya Kanda in the attitudes of a king and his kingship. Here Sugreeva is indulged in bodily pleasures with his own females and in Aranya Kanda, as accused by Shurpanakha, Ravana is hankering after other's women. Here Sugreeva dizzy with drinks and in Aranya Ravana is dizzy with his supremacy. These two chapters, as detailed by ancient commentators, equally deal with raaja niiti shastra 'political science.' Here the only rescue to Sugreeva is Tara, who saves the face of Sugreeva before Lakshmana, whereas Ravana has none to come to his aid when chided by Shurpanakha. Out of total 66 verses that are here in this traditional edition, verses from 25 to 62 are unavailable in critical edition, perhaps estimating them to be lateral interpolations, and there this chapter is quickly concluded. These verses belong to the exposition of 'kingly vices...' on which Tara rationally defends."
Kishkindha Kanda,33,1,"Then on invitation to inside, Lakshmana, the slayer of braving enemies, entered that delightful cavelike Kishkindha at Rama's orders."
Kishkindha Kanda,33,2,On seeing Lakshmana the huge bodied and highly mighty monkeys available at the gateway stood back with their palms adjoined in supplication.
Kishkindha Kanda,33,3,"But on seeing at the fumingly infuriated son of Dasharatha, all the monkeys have become scared and they did not even gather around him."
Kishkindha Kanda,33,4,"Glorious Lakshmana has seen the splendid Kishkindha which is a colossal cave crafted with jewels, replete with flowered orchards and richly rife with gemlike-objects d'art."
Kishkindha Kanda,33,5,"Kishkindha is compacted with mansions and multi-storied buildings that are embellished with various precious stones, and it is enlivened with blossomed trees that bear fruit of every relish and of every season, and Lakshmana has seen such a Kishkindha."
Kishkindha Kanda,33,6,"That city is brightened with vanara-s who with their prepossessing appearances are attired in marvellous garlands and garments, and who can change their guise just by their wish, as they are the children of gods and gandharva-s, and Lakshmana has seen such a city."
Kishkindha Kanda,33,7,"She is perfumed with the fragrances that are pleasing the sense of smell like sandal-scent, true-aloe-scent, and the scents of lotuses, and her wide avenues are highly exhilarated with the bouquet of flower-liquors and grape-wines, and Lakshmana has seen such a sweet-scanted city Kishkindha."
Kishkindha Kanda,33,8,"In that city Lakshmana of Raghava dynasty has seen buildings that are not single-storied but multi-storied, semblable with Mt. Vindhya and Mt. Meru, and he even saw mountain-rapids with pure water."
Kishkindha Kanda,33,10,"On the kings-way Lakshmana has seen the exquisite mansion of Angada, likewise the lavish mansions of distinction pertaining to the other vanara chiefs, namely Dvivida, Gavaya, Gavaaksha, Gaja, and Sharabha, Vidyunmaali, Sampaati, Suuryaaksha, Hanuma, and that of the noble-souled Nala, and even those of Virabaahu, Subaahu, Kumuda, Sushena, Lt. Taara, Jambavanta, Dadhivaktra, Niila, Supaatala, and that of Sunetra. [4-33-9, 10, 11, 12]"
Kishkindha Kanda,33,13,"Those mansions that glitter like silver-clouds, fragrant with scents and festooned with flower-tassels, replete with wealth and food grains, are beaming with gemlike female-vanara-s, and Lakshmana saw them on his way."
Kishkindha Kanda,33,12,"The grand palace of the king of monkeys, Sugreeva, which vies with the palace of Indra is inaccessibly immured in a whitely mountain. The spires of that palace are similar to the peaks of Mt. Kailash and it is shining forth with fully blossomed trees yielding fruits that can fulfil every relish of everyone. Some more providential and heart-pleasing trees available there are the endowment of Indra, which in shine are equal to blackish rainy-clouds, yielding divine flowers and fruits, and casting cool shades. Excellent garlands are strung round the palace and robust monkeys wielding weapons are screening its gateways, while its main archway cast in refined golden is splendorous. And the very bold Lakshmana unimpededly entered such a fascinating palace of Sugreeva, as with the sun entering a colossal cloud. [4-33-14, 15, 16, 17, 18]"
Kishkindha Kanda,33,13,"Passing through a set of seven courtyards in which carriers like palanquins, sedans, and even settees are spread over, that duty-bound Lakshmana has seen the highly protected and prodigious palace-chambers of Sugreeva, which is stuffed here and there with numerous golden and silver love-beds and divans on which highly valuable upholstery is provided. [4-33-19, 20]"
Kishkindha Kanda,33,14,"On his very entry Lakshmana heard the ongoing melodious tunes commixed with lyrics and strains of string-instruments, and all are unvarying in cadence, wording and lettering."
Kishkindha Kanda,33,21,"On his very entry Lakshmana heard the ongoing melodious tunes of lyrics with pulsing wording and lettering, conjoined with strains from string-instruments, like Veena etc., and all have a pulsating cadency."
Kishkindha Kanda,33,22,And the great-mighty Lakshmana has seen many females in Sugreeva's palace with diverse features and prideful of their beauty and youth.
Kishkindha Kanda,33,17,"On observing the females of a worthy bloodline in the palace of Sugreeva, who are wearing garlands of worthily flowers, engrossed in making worthwhile flower-tassels and even adorned with worthiest jewellery, he also made a mark of the chambermaids. None of them is overawed, overstrained, and everyone is over-embellished in dressiness. [4-33-23, 24]"
Kishkindha Kanda,33,25,Thereafter on hearing the chimes of silver-anklets and tintinnabulations of golden cinctures of female vanara-s that refulgent Saumitri is embarrassed to proceed further.
Kishkindha Kanda,33,26,"On hearing the tinkles of the jewellery of female vanara-s valiant Lakshmana is highly provoked with an instantaneous bitterness, and he twitched bowstring as though to fill all the points of compass with twanging."
Kishkindha Kanda,33,27,"His decent conduct hauling him down dextrous Lakshmana stood aside contingent on isolation, and alongside his heartfelt anguish of Rama."
Kishkindha Kanda,33,28,With that twang of the bowstring the king of fly-jumpers Sugreeva is startled and jerked up from his exquisite seat as he ensured that Lakshmana has arrived.
Kishkindha Kanda,33,29,"""As Angada indicated to me earlier, Saumitri, the votary of his brother, has come down on... it is very clear..."" Thus Sugreeva exclaimed."
Kishkindha Kanda,33,30,"As has been apprised by Angada earlier, and even now by the twang of bowstring, that vanara Sugreeva made up his mind about Lakshmana's arrival, and he has become whey-faced."
Kishkindha Kanda,33,31,The chief of monkeys Sugreeva then staidly spoke this advantageous word to the exquisite lady Tara while his heart is bewildered with dismay.
Kishkindha Kanda,33,32,"""This brother of Raghava is mellow-hearted by his nature, oh, suavely eye-browed Tara, but he turned up as if with some disdain, really what must be the reason for a grudge!"
Kishkindha Kanda,33,33,"""What do you see as the basis of this young man's spite, oh impeccable Tara, this best one among men will not invoke despite, indeed, to a fault."
Kishkindha Kanda,33,34,"""If you consider that we have done something objectionable to him, in the least, let that be quickly determined by your nimble-wittedness and let that be made known immediately."
Kishkindha Kanda,33,35,"""Otherwise, oh, lady, you alone are apt to see him in person, and it will be apt of you to appease him with words blent with mitigation."
Kishkindha Kanda,33,36,"""Just on seeing you he that highly pure-souled Lakshmana will stop venting his spleen, by the way, great-souls will not be rampageous with women, isn't it!"
Kishkindha Kanda,33,37,"""If you seek his presence with propitiatory words his heart and senses will be pacified, and then I will be able to see that lotus-petal-eyed Lakshmana, the destroyer of his enemies."" Sugreeva thus spoke to Tara."
Kishkindha Kanda,33,38,"Exquisitely featured Tara went to the proximity of Lakshmana with a waddling gait, tipsily flustering eyes, riviï¿½re-strings of golden cincture dangling, and with a sticklike gracile body humbly bent."
Kishkindha Kanda,33,39,"On observing the wife of the king of monkeys, the great-souled son of the king of humans stood aside unemotionally, and because of the presence of females he backed down on his anger with his face cast down."
Kishkindha Kanda,33,40,"She who is unblushing by virtue of her inebriety ad even by the gracious look of the prince Lakshmana, such a Tara spoke a highly noteworthy sentence that is dauntless in friendliness and entirely mitigatory in its vein."
Kishkindha Kanda,33,41,"""Oh, prince, what is the cause of your anger? Who is not abiding by your oral order? And who is he that draweth nigh of a wildfire that is befalling on a forest of dried-up trees, without a shadow of doubt?"" Tara enquired thus with Lakshmana."
Kishkindha Kanda,33,42,"On hearing her words which are with a prelude of propitiation, and which by far evince friendship for all practical purposes, Lakshmana trustfully spoke these words."
Kishkindha Kanda,33,43,"""Oh, Tara, the associate of husband's prosperity! Why your husband is bound up in profligacy alone, remiss in garnering rectitude and riches, and his dereliction is unbeknownst to you, is it!"
Kishkindha Kanda,33,44,"""Without thinking either about the interests of the kingdom or about us that are cringing to anguish, oh, Tara, your husband along with his council of ministers is indulged in lechery."
Kishkindha Kanda,33,45,"""On stipulating a four month criterion for an embargo the king of fly-jumpers is not able to realise the completion of that period as he is frantically insensible."
Kishkindha Kanda,33,46,"""For the purpose of achieving rightly rectitude and rightful riches this way of bacchanalia is inappreciable, isn't it! Just going on drinking will bring prosperity, aspirations and even probity to ruin."
Kishkindha Kanda,33,47,"""If one is not going to requite the favour done in his respect an awful detriment occurs in his own rectitude, isn't it. Thereby, that reneger will loose a highly noble friend and thereby a great shortcoming occurs to him in achieving his purposes. Thus a threefold ill befalls on that reneger."
Kishkindha Kanda,33,48,"""Indeed a friend avowed to truthfulness and virtuousness is greater than one's own means and aspirations, but you husband forsaking that pair of his means and aspirations that have been fulfilled by such a righteous friend, he is not even standing by the probity."
Kishkindha Kanda,33,49,"""Therefore, when our present task is standstill in this way due to the bouts of your husband, oh, the knower of the brunt of tasks, what is it we can undertake hereafter...you yourself may aptly give an example..."" Thus, Lakshmana spoke curtly to Tara."
Kishkindha Kanda,33,43,"On hearing his words containing means, merit and reconciliation, and of mellowly tendency of Lakshmana, Tara realized that the purpose of Rama is lapsed, but having confidence in ultimate success she again said to him."
Kishkindha Kanda,33,50,"On hearing his words containing means, merit and reconciliation, and of mellowly tendency of Lakshmana, and even on realizing the lapse committed by Sugreeva in the purpose of Rama, yet reposing her confidence in Sugreeva's capability to achieve results, she again said to Lakshmana."
Kishkindha Kanda,33,51,"""Oh, prince, this not the time for angering, also your own people shall not be subjected to anger, and it will be apt of you to tolerate Sugreeva's fault because he is desirous of achieving results for you."
Kishkindha Kanda,33,52,"How in name can a meritoriously high-minded being will show his anger on a relatively mightless inferior being, say Sugreeva, whose mightiest brother's mightiness and essence, say that of Vali, are deducted by none other but by your brother associated with you, and oh, lad, who goes into the control of fury, say of your kind, while he is restrained by his perfection, and a source of abstemiousness."
Kishkindha Kanda,33,53,"""I am aware of the fury of Rama, the friend of champion of the monkeys, namely Sugreeva, I am also aware of the time lapse in the task, I am even aware of the folly we have committed, and what need be done in this matter, I am well aware."
Kishkindha Kanda,33,54,"""As to how the intensity of bodily pleasure-seeking will be highly intolerable, I am aware even of that, and I am equally aware of those female vanara-s with whom Sugreeva is now incessantly bound up with lust."
Kishkindha Kanda,33,55,"""Gauging by your mindset which is presently bridled by fury, you appear to be disinclined towards spells of sensualities, thus these aspects are past your comprehension. All right! If a man were to be voluptuary he will be inadvertent of place and time, isn't it! Then, how about ethicalities, or rights and wrongs?"
Kishkindha Kanda,33,56,"""He who shunned decency because of the vehemence of randiness, oh, the eradicator of braving enemies, and he who is delighting in lust is consorted with me, ergo condone your brother-like Sugreeva, the protector of Vaanara dynasty."
Kishkindha Kanda,33,57,"""Esteemed sages who take delight in their holy merit and pious asceticism, they themselves will be closely following the course of their desire fulfilment when entangled in lust, then how about this one, namely Sugreeva, being an impulsive monkey, besides being a king, how he cannot wallow in enjoyments."
Kishkindha Kanda,33,58,"She that vanara female Tara whose eyes are fluttery under the influence having said this way, she again picked up where she left off and sentimentally spoke this sentence to Lakshmana whose brunt is inestimable, in the interest of her husband's wellbeing."
Kishkindha Kanda,33,59,"""On the part of his endeavour in your task, oh, best one among men, he has ordered long before for its operation aiming to achieve your objective, despite of the fact that he is servile to overindulgence."
Kishkindha Kanda,33,60,"""By all means, marvellously intrepid Vanara-s that are the residents of various mountains and that can change gusie just by their wish have come in hundreds, in thousands, in millions."
Kishkindha Kanda,33,61,"""Hence oh, dextrous one, get inside the palace-chambers for you have been standing here at the door coyly unwilling to behold womenfolk inside, and enough is this upholding of tradition by you. Oh, come on, peering at the wives of friends with a friendly intent is not at all impolite for good-willers."" Thus Tara affectionately invited Lakshmana inside the palace-chambers."
Kishkindha Kanda,33,62,"Welcomed by Tara and hastened by haste of his duty, that dextrous enemy-destroyer Lakshmana entered the select-chambers."
Kishkindha Kanda,33,57,"Lakshmana has then seen him who is seated like the Sun in firmament on a choicest golden seat which is elaborated with worthiest upholstery, whose body is remarkable besides being spruced up with excellent ornaments, who is wearing exquisite garlands and robes, who is glorious with a marvellous appearance and even appeared as an unconquerable as with Indra, and who is presently enwreathed with vanara-females who are also bedecked with precious ornamentation and garlands, and on seeing him Lakshmana with franticly bloodshot eyes appeared as the Terminator. [4-33-63, 64, 65]"
Kishkindha Kanda,33,66,"Sugreeva whose complexion is like that of rich gold is seated on an exquisite seat tightly hugging his wife Ruma, and that brave one has seen Lakshmana whose quintessence is never-flinching, thus, that suspiciously wide-eyed Sugreeva made sheep eyes at the furiously broad-eyed Lakshmana."
Kishkindha Kanda,34,1,"On seeing the illustrious Lakshmana who entered unimpededly and infuriately, Sugreeva became one with agitated senses."
Kishkindha Kanda,34,2,"On seeing Lakshmana, the son of Dasharatha, who is exasperated and exhaling heavily, and who searing in the anguish of his brother is flaring up like a firestorm, Sugreeva hopped up from his golden seat and tottered like the highly decorated flagstaff of Indra, which will be wobbly before it is thrown to ground after the ritual. [4-34-2, 3]"
Kishkindha Kanda,34,4,"While Sugreeva is jumping up stumblingly, stumbled with him are Ruma and the other females in tow, who are so far clinging to him, like the clusters of stars that spring up on the emergence of full moon in sky."
Kishkindha Kanda,34,5,"That fortunate Sugreeva whose eyes are bloodshot with drinking flurried towards Lakshmana adjoining palms in supplication, and became standstill at his nearby, like a lofty kalpa vriksha wish-fulfilling tree."
Kishkindha Kanda,34,6,Infuriate Lakshmana spoke to Sugreeva who like the star clustered moon is standing with his wife Ruma at his side amid other vanara females.
Kishkindha Kanda,34,7,"""One who is dynamic, abounding with best troopers, sympathetic, senses conquered, a faithful one and an advocate of truth, he alone thrives as a king in the world."
Kishkindha Kanda,34,8,"""He who is enthroned as a king but anchored himself to dishonesty and makes fake assurances to helpful friends, who can be more ruthless than him?"
Kishkindha Kanda,34,9,"""A person gets attached to the sin of killing of a hundred of his manes, deified souls of his own ancestors, if he promises to gift one horse but fails to do so, and in promising to gift one cow but failing in it he gets the sin of killing a thousand manes, and if he promises to a person to do the needful help and fails in rendering that help, then he gets the sin of suicide along with the sin of killing his own kith and kin."
Kishkindha Kanda,34,10,"""He who gets his means fulfilled earlier through his friends but does not requite them, oh, king of monkeys, such a treacherous one is eliminable for all beings."
Kishkindha Kanda,34,11,"""On seeing such perfidious soul, oh, fly-jumper, Brahma irefully declared this verse which is reverenced by all the worlds, you too may know it."
Kishkindha Kanda,34,12,""" 'The savants have ordained atonement for slayers of cows, for drinkers of liquors, thus for thieves and infringers of solemnity, but no atonement is available to a treacherous person."
Kishkindha Kanda,34,13,"""Oh, Vanara, firstly you have got your purpose fulfilled and by that reason you are not reciprocating help to Rama, thereby you are an uncultured and unfriendly one, and illusive is your word of honour."
Kishkindha Kanda,34,14,"""Oh, Vanara, you achieved your means through Rama, and Rama is wishing for his endeavour through you, and I wonder whether the search for Seetha is not your duty?"
Kishkindha Kanda,34,15,"""An illusive promisor basking in churlish pleasures, such as you are, Rama has not realised that you are a serpent with the croaking of a frog."
Kishkindha Kanda,34,16,"""By the highly prudent and compassionate Rama, you the sinner got the kingdom of monkeys, and it is a gain of an evil-soul from a noble-soul."
Kishkindha Kanda,34,17,"""If you do not recognise what the noble-souled Raghava has done to you, you will be instantly killed with incisive arrows enabling you to see Vali."
Kishkindha Kanda,34,18,"""Oh, Sugreeva, abide by your commitment. The path by which slain Vali has gone that path is not tapered off, as such do not tread Vali's path."
Kishkindha Kanda,34,19,"""Definitely you are not envisaging the Thunderbolt similar arrows from the bow of the best one from Ikshvaku dynasty, Rama, thereby you are enjoying luxuries joyously without giving a thought to Rama's mission even at your heart."
Kishkindha Kanda,35,1,"Tara with her visage that shines like the Lord of Stars, namely the Moon, then spoke to the son of queen Sumitra, namely Lakshmana, who while he is speaking is as though blazing with his own resplendence."
Kishkindha Kanda,35,2,"""Let not this king of monkeys be addressed in this way, oh, Lakshmana, and he is not warranted to listen such tongue-lashing, especially from your tongue."
Kishkindha Kanda,35,3,"""Sugreeva is not an unthankful one, oh, brave Lakshmana, a treacherous one - no; a flagitious one - no; an utterer of untruth - no; a duplicitous one, no, this king of monkeys is not even that."
Kishkindha Kanda,35,4,"""Although he is a monkey this Sugreeva has not dismissed from his mind even the favour Rama has done in his respect, oh, valiant Lakshmana, which in combat is impractical for others."
Kishkindha Kanda,35,5,"""By the beneficence of Rama, oh, the enemy-scorcher Lakshmana, now Sugreeva is privileged with reputation, everlasting kingship of monkeys, more so with Ruma and me as well."
Kishkindha Kanda,35,6,"""Hitherto he has tolerated high anguish and on the attainment of this high comfort of kingship he has not oriented himself to the time-oriented actions as with saint Vishvamitra."
Kishkindha Kanda,35,7,"""Oh, Lakshmana, that great-sage Vishvamitra clinging together with Ghritaachi, an angelic apsara, for a period of ten years, forsooth that virtue-souled sage regarded that period as one day."
Kishkindha Kanda,35,8,"""When he who is a best one among the time-knowers, that great-resplendent Sage Vishvamitra himself is not privy to the occasioned time for a good many years, why talking about a commoner again."
Kishkindha Kanda,35,9,"""He who is overwrought and now undergoing natural bodily appetites, oh, Lakshmana, and who is overtired as he is absolutely discontent in the concupiscence, such as Sugreeva is, it will be apt of Rama to bear with him for a while."
Kishkindha Kanda,35,10,"""Without knowing realities, oh, young man Lakshmana, it will be extraneous of you to hastily enter into the control of your rancour like a commoner."
Kishkindha Kanda,35,11,"""Men of your kind having conscientiousness, oh, best one among men, do not hurriedly rush in and get clutched by their own rancour, unconscionably."
Kishkindha Kanda,35,12,"""I beg for your grace, oh, virtue-knower, in the interest of Sugreeva with all my equability, and you may dispel this clangour upshot in high dudgeon of yours."
Kishkindha Kanda,35,13,"""In the honour of Rama, Sugreeva will disown his wife Ruma, even me, even Angada, why us, he will disown whole kingdom with its riches, food grains, livestock and whatnot, as I can infer."
Kishkindha Kanda,35,14,"""On eliminating that worst demon Ravana, Sugreeva can bring Seetha together with Raghava, as with the coalescing of star Rohini with the Moon."
Kishkindha Kanda,35,15,"""It is said that the demons in Lanka are a trillion, plus thirty-six thousands of units of military, where one unit consists of a ten-thousand warriors, and hundreds and thousands of other demons are there, thus they say."
Kishkindha Kanda,35,16,"""Without eliminating those unassailable and guise changing demons, it is impracticable to eliminate him who has abducted Maithili, namely Ravana."
Kishkindha Kanda,35,17,"""Oh, Lakshmana, it is impossible to kill those demons, or that Ravana, the evil-doer and abductor of Seetha, without any assistance, more so to Sugreeva..."
Kishkindha Kanda,35,18,"""This way Vali was saying and that king of monkeys is well-informed in these aspects, isn't it! But how Ravana mustered up these many troops is unclear to me, and I am saying what I heard from Vali."
Kishkindha Kanda,35,19,"""Intending that assistance to you in war, best monkeys are hastened in all directions, to muster up very many best of the best monkeys."
Kishkindha Kanda,35,20,"""Determined to achieve the objective of Raghava this king of monkeys Sugreeva has not bestirred himself while awaiting the return of those venturesome and very great mighty monkey-warriors who are sent out."
Kishkindha Kanda,35,21,"""According to the well-organised groundwork earlier made by Sugreeva, oh, Saumitri, all of those great-mighty monkeys have to arrive here today itself."
Kishkindha Kanda,35,22,"""Only today millions and millions of bears and hundredfold millions of baboons, and innumerable monkeys who by their own flare are like firebrands will arrive in your fore, oh, Lakshmana, thereby, oh, the enemy-repressor, therefore rebut your rage."
Kishkindha Kanda,35,23,"""On staring at this angry face of yours, and on gazing at the angrily bloodshot eyes of yours, unsecured is the peace to the females of monkeys chief, and with the fear caused at first by Vali's elimination we are all indeed premonished about such a happening in respect of Sugreeva too."
Kishkindha Kanda,36,1,"In that way when Tara has submissively argued with words containing probity, Saumitri gave assent to her perspective as he is soft by his nature."
Kishkindha Kanda,36,2,"And when Lakshmana conceded to that argument of Tara, Sugreeva, the king of monkey-troops, got rid of his highly intense scare of Lakshmana, like the riddance of a dampened cloth."
Kishkindha Kanda,36,3,"Sugreeva, the king of vanara-s, then ripped apart the superb garland which is so far enwreathing his neck, and which has several strands according several gratifications, and he also became sober as though the insobriety is ripped from his mind."
Kishkindha Kanda,36,4,"Sugreeva who is the most powerful one among all vanara-s, then placatingly spoke this humble sentence to Lakshmana, whose prowess is most formidable."
Kishkindha Kanda,36,5,"""My prosperity, prominence and this perpetual kingdom of monkeys are once mislaid, but oh, Soumitri, I regained all this just by the beneficence of Rama."
Kishkindha Kanda,36,6,"""Who is capable of requiting Rama, oh, prince Lakshmana, even by a fraction of that kind of inestimable help taken from him, as that lord is renowned by actions particular to himself, like daring and eliminating Vali."
Kishkindha Kanda,36,6,"""Who is capable of repudiating such a lordly Rama, even by a fraction of one's own bravery, unless he is prepared to tread that kind of path on which Vali has gone."
Kishkindha Kanda,36,7,"""Virtue-souled Raghava reacquires Seetha, and even exterminates Ravana by himself with his own resplendence, while I and my assistance remain only in name."
Kishkindha Kanda,36,8,"""Basically, why some measures of succour need be extended to him who has ripped seven gigantic-trees, a mountain, and even the earth, all just with one arrow!"
Kishkindha Kanda,36,9,"""He who outstretches his bow with a clangour by which the earth with its mountains quakes, oh, Lakshmana, to him these aides are really of what aid, indeed!"
Kishkindha Kanda,36,10,"""Lakshmana, I just can tread behind that king of people, Rama, on his charging to eliminate enemy Ravana along with all of his vanguards, that's all."
Kishkindha Kanda,36,11,"""If I have overstepped either in faith or friendliness, in the least, that may be pardoned for I am an attendant of yours. By the way, none is unoffending."
Kishkindha Kanda,36,12,"Lakshmana is pleased with that great-souled Sugreeva who is speaking thus, and said this he said to him, indeed, in friendliness."
Kishkindha Kanda,36,13,"""In anyway, my brother indeed has a defender with him, oh, king of vanara-s Sugreeva, especially you, who are a defender of your own word and a deferential one towards Rama."
Kishkindha Kanda,36,14,"""With this kind of preponderance and plainness you possess, Sugreeva, you are the only merited one to enjoy this unexcelled kingdom of monkeys."
Kishkindha Kanda,36,15,"""Before long, Sugreeva, dauntless Rama will be eliminating enemies in a war with you as his supporter, there is no doubt about it."
Kishkindha Kanda,36,16,"""You are the knower of virtuousness and gratefulness and you do not retreat from battlegrounds, or, on your own word, thus what you have said is conclusive as well as coherent."
Kishkindha Kanda,36,17,"""Even though one has capability to know his own lapse and speak it up, oh, ablest among Vanara-s, who is he that behoves outspokenly, excepting my elder brother and you."
Kishkindha Kanda,36,18,"""You are a coequal to Rama by your valour and vigour and oh, best one among monkeys, gods have given you after a long time."
Kishkindha Kanda,36,19,"""However, you quickly start from here along with me, oh, brave one, and embolden your friend who is anguishing in the despoilment of his wife."
Kishkindha Kanda,36,20,"""Oh, friend, on hearing that which querulously spoken by Rama, who is downhearted in his anguish, I too reflexively spoke bitter-words to you, and thus whatever I spoke that may be pardoned."
Kishkindha Kanda,37,1,"When the great-souled Lakshmana spoke to Sugreeva in this way, Sugreeva spoke this word to Hanuma who is available at his side."
Kishkindha Kanda,37,2,"""Convoke the Vaanara-s available on the summits of these five mountains, namely Mt. Mahendra, Mt. Himalaya, Mt. Vindhya, and Mt. Kailash and those that are on the whitish peak of Mt. Mandara. As well as those that are on the mountains at seashore, udaya adri, namely 'sunrise-mountain,' which mountains will always be dazzling with the tinge of youthful sun. And them that are on the mountains which shine in the ochry hue of evening clouds, asta adri, namely 'sunset-mountain' and which mountains are situated at the Palace of Sun. And the catastrophic monkey chiefs that are abiding in the palm groves of Mt. Padma. Also thus, the fly-jumpers who are similar to black-mascara and black-clouds in their shine, and who match elephants in their vigour, and who live on Mt. Anjana, they too are to be convened. Those fly-jumpers whose complexion will be golden and dwell in the caves of Great-Mountain, besides those who are on the mountainsides of Mt. Meru, and those biding on the Black-Red mountain, along with those topmost speeded fly-jumpers living on Mt. Great-Ochre swilling palm-toddy, these are to be summoned. Further, the vanara-s who will be in the tinge of rising sun and who dwell in the highly delightful, richly fragrant and lofty woodlands that are surrounded with the delightful hermitages of sages are to be summoned. Along with them, the vanara-s who are in the interiors of forests, they are also to be called for. Why citing a few? Those and those monkeys that are on the earth, all of them are to be assembled. Oh, Hanuma, you quickly summon all of the topmost speeded vanara-s by employing concessions, conciliations and the like procedures. [4-37-2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]"
Kishkindha Kanda,37,10,"""In the first instance highly speedy vanara-s are hastened at my commanded, however, you hasten some more monkey chiefs for the purpose of hastening them."
Kishkindha Kanda,37,11,"""Those that are entangled with creature comforts, and those that are stringy dawdlers, you quickly lead all of those monkey chiefs in here."
Kishkindha Kanda,37,12,"""And such of those vanara-s that do not arrive within ten days by my command, those miscreants are eliminable as the abusers of king's decree."
Kishkindha Kanda,37,13,"""Let all the lionly monkeys available on earth that abide by my control start coming to this place in hundreds, thousands, even in millions, by my command."
Kishkindha Kanda,37,4,"""The champions of monkeys with ghastly aspects and similar in shine with the mountains and clouds shall start coming here by my command, fly-jumping as though to overcast the sky."
Kishkindha Kanda,37,15,"""Let those vanara-s who know the routes to the dwelling places of other monkeys expeditiously proceed on quick-routes, and gather all of the monkeys available on earth at my command."" Sugreeva ordered Hanuma that way."
Kishkindha Kanda,37,16,"On hearing the order of Sugreeva, the king of vanara-s, Hanuma, the son of Air-god has started to dispatch valorous monkeys in all directions."
Kishkindha Kanda,37,17,"In a split-second, the vanara-s that are sent by the king of vanara-s have skyrocketed to the airways of birds and stars on their way, and indeed reached the vault of heaven, which was once trodden by Vishnu."
Kishkindha Kanda,37,18,"After skyrocketing those monkeys have reached the monkeys that are living at seashores and islands, in the caves and crags of mountains, and at lakeshores and their surrounds, and motivated all of the monkeys available there towards the cause of Rama."
Kishkindha Kanda,37,19,"On hearing that command of the king of kings of Vanara-s, Sugreeva, who is semblable with the Death-god and Time-god, all of the monkeys have arrived with the terror of Sugreeva haunting them."
Kishkindha Kanda,37,20,"Then thirty million fly-jumpers whose swiftness is inconceivable, and whose shine is like that of black-mascara have sallied forth from mountain Anjana to there where Raghava is camping, i.e., Mt. Prasravana."
Kishkindha Kanda,37,21,"Hundred million monkeys who take delight on the best mountain where the sun goes into dusk, namely the westerly mountains, asta adri, and whose hue is similar to the refined gold, for dusk has a golden hue, have jumped in."
Kishkindha Kanda,37,22,"Vanara-s who are in the hue of lion's mane have turned up in thousand crores, say hundred billion, from the pinnacles of Mt. Kailash."
Kishkindha Kanda,37,23,"Those that are sheltered on Himalayas subsisting on fruits and tubers have arrived in a thousand of thousand crores, say a trillion."
Kishkindha Kanda,37,24,"Millions and millions of Vanara-s whose looks and deeds are gruesome, and who equal the planet Mars in their crimson-flush, as they dwell on the hotbeds of Mt. Vindhya, have swiftly alighted from Mt. Vindhya."
Kishkindha Kanda,37,25,"The count of those vanara-s who are basically domiciled at the coasts of milky ocean, the residents of Tamala woodlands, and those who feed on coconuts dwelling in coconut groves, and who have presently come from those places is uncountable."
Kishkindha Kanda,37,26,"That highly forceful military force of vanara-s has arrived from forests, caverns and riversides with their leaping and bounding on the sky blocking up the sun as if they have gulped him down."
Kishkindha Kanda,37,27,"The Vanara-s who went from Kishkindha to hasten up all the other monkeys of all quarters, those champions have reached Himalayan Mountains and saw exceptional trees on them."
Kishkindha Kanda,37,28,"On that best and auspicious mountain, once a glorious Vedic-ritual intending God Shiva took place, which pleased the hearts of all gods."
Kishkindha Kanda,37,29,"There the vanara-s have seen luscious tubers and fruits similar to nectar, which have originated from the oblational food material spattered in the Vedic-ritual for Shiva."
Kishkindha Kanda,37,30,"If one eats for one time, a little of those divine and heart-pleasing fruits and tubers that have taken their origin from that oblational food material, he remains satiated for a month."
Kishkindha Kanda,37,31,"The best monkeys that are fruit-eaters have collected those divine fruits, tubers, and even the divine medicinal herbs."
Kishkindha Kanda,37,32,"On going to the cardinal ground of Vedic-ritual which was performed once, those vanara-s fetched highly fragrant flowers in order to please Sugreeva."
Kishkindha Kanda,37,33,"On motivating all of the monkeys on earth, all those best monkeys who proceeded to forgather other monkeys, quickly returned to Kishkindha ahead of the forgathered troops of monkeys."
Kishkindha Kanda,37,34,"Those quick paced monkeys quickly reached Kishkindha just at that moment when Lakshmana is still with Sugreeva, and those monkeys arrived at that place where Sugreeva is available along with Lakshmana."
Kishkindha Kanda,37,35,"Taking the medicinal herbs, fruits, and tubers along with them, all of those Vaanaras obliged Sugreeva to accept fruits, tubers and herbs as royal gifts, and they also spoke this word to Sugreeva."
Kishkindha Kanda,37,36,"""We have rounded up all the mountains, rivers, and forests even, and all of the Vanara-s available on earth are fetched to your fore according to your command."" Thus the monkeys said to Sugreeva."
Kishkindha Kanda,37,37,On listening these words then the king of fly-jumpers Sugreeva is gladdened and accepted the gifts brought from Himalayas from all of them.
Kishkindha Kanda,38,1,"On receiving all those gifts brought in by the Vanara-s from Himalayas, Sugreeva dispersed them all with approbation."
Kishkindha Kanda,38,2,"On dispersing thousands of monkeys who have effectuated their errand of summoning all monkeys on the earth, Sugreeva deemed that his own aspirations and as well as those of that great-mighty Rama are achieved."
Kishkindha Kanda,38,3,"Gladdening Sugreeva who is indomitably mighty and the indomitable one among all vanara-s, Lakshmana spoke these courteous words to him, ""oh, gentle one, if it please you, make an exit from Kishkindha."" [4-38-3, 4a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,38,4,"On hearing the courteous words of Lakshmana Sugreeva is extremely pleased and he indeed spoke this sentence to him, ""So be it. Let us go. I remain biddable in your command."" [4-38-4b, 5]"
Kishkindha Kanda,38,6,"Sugreeva speaking thus to Lakshmana, whose person itself is auspicious, then bade adieu to Lady Tara and the other female vanara-s."
Kishkindha Kanda,38,7,"Sugreeva shouted sharply saying, ""come here,"" at the best monkey-adjutants and on hearing his call all of those monkeys that are spared to see the ladies of palace chambers have come there swiftly with their palms adjoined in supplication."
Kishkindha Kanda,38,7,"Then the king Sugreeva whose refulgence is kindred to that of sun has said to those vanara-s that have arrived there, ""oh, vanara-s, immediately position my palanquin before me."" [4-38-8b, 9a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,38,8,"On hearing his words those monkeys who are the adept ones in their agility right away brought an exquisite palanquin and readily started to position it at his nearby. [4-38-9b, 10a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,38,9,"And on seeing palanquin positioned at his nearby the king of monkeys Sugreeva said to Saumitri, ""you mount it, Lakshmana, be quick."" [4-38-10b, 11a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,38,10,"Saying so Sugreeva got into that golden carriage which in shine is like the sun and which has many monkey-carriers along with Lakshmana. [4-38-11b, 12a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,38,11,"Sugreeva who achieved the kingdom of unexcelled magnificence has started out that magnificently to the high extolment of panegyrists, while a white royal-parasol spread overhead the palanquin, white fur-fans fanning him from all over, and while conch-shells are blowing loud and drums are drumming high. [4-38-12b, 13, 14a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,38,12,"Sugreeva travelled thus surrounded with many hundreds of vanara-s, who look confrontational and who wielded weapons, to the place where Rama is staying. [4-38-14b, 15a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,38,13,"On reaching the province where Rama is staying in all his adoration to that place, the great-resplendent Sugreeva descended the palanquin along with Lakshmana. [4-38-15b, 16a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,38,14,"When Sugreeva reached Rama he stood still with adjoined-palms, and when he remained still with palm-fold all the other monkeys stood still with palm-fold. [4-38-16b, 17a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,38,15,"Rama became exultant of Sugreeva on seeing the massive army of Vanara-s which is just like a vast lake plethoric with buds of lotuses. [4-38-17b, 18a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,38,16,"Raghava raised and tightly hugged the king of monkeys Sugreeva, who has prostrated himself with his head touching the feet of Rama, with care and credit. [4-38-18b, 19a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,38,17,"After hugging Sugreeva that virtue-souled Rama then said to him, ""be seated."" Then on seeing Sugreeva who took seat on ground Rama spoke to him. [4-38-19b, 20a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,38,18,"""He alone is the king, oh, valiant Sugreeva, who always divides time for devoting himself to probity, prosperity and pleasure-seeking. [4-38-20b, 21a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,38,19,"""If one devotes himself to pleasure-seeking alone, casting off the probity and like that the prosperity also, he is like the one who slept on a treetop who awakens only after falling down. [4-38-21b, 22a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,38,20,"""And the king who is bound up in eliminating unfriendly ones and bound up with forgathering friends, he will be enjoined with righteousness, and he even becomes the real enjoyer of the fruit of threefold virtues, namely dharma, artha, kaama - probity, prosperity and pleasures. [4-38-22b, 23a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,38,21,"""Oh, enemy-eliminator, time for endeavour has come, oh, king of monkeys, let this be discussed along with your monkey-ministers."" Thus Rama spoke to Sugreeva. [4-38-23b, 24a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,38,22,"When Rama addressed him in this way, Sugreeva said these words to Rama, ""oh, dextrous Rama, by your beneficence I have repossessed prosperity, popularity and this everlasting kingdom of monkeys which are actually mislaid. [4-38-24b, 25]"
Kishkindha Kanda,38,26,"""Oh, god, by your and your brother's benevolence alone I regained what I lost, oh, victorious one among victors, and he who does not requite the favour that has been done for him will become the vitiator of probity among men."
Kishkindha Kanda,38,27,"""These are the hundreds of vanara chiefs, oh, enemy-subjugator, who have just returned on forgathering all of the forceful vanara-s on earth."
Kishkindha Kanda,38,25,"""Oh, Raghava, the legatee of Raghu, those vanara-s with dreadful appearance, and who are the experts in permeating the impenetrable forests, woodlands and impassable mountains are coming. And the bears, monkeys and brave baboons who are the children of gods and gandharva-s, and who change their guise just by their wish are halfway through on their path duly fenced round with one's own forces. [4-38-28, 29]"
Kishkindha Kanda,38,26,"""Oh, king, some of the fly-jumpers that are arriving are with a hundred-legion, some with a hundred-thousand legion, and even some with millions of legions, while the some are on the way with specific legions like aayuta-s, shanku-s. And oh, valiant one Rama, some with legions of arbuda-s, and some with hundreds of arbuda-s, some with madhya-s, and some with antaH-s are coming. Some more are coming with samudra-s and some with paraardha-s legions of monkeys. Oh, enemy-flamer Rama, the legions of monkeys along with their monkey commanders who are viable to Mahendra in valour, and who compare with massive clouds and mountains, and who domiciled on Mt. Meru and Mt. Vindhya will be coming in your service. [4-38-30, 31, 32]"
Kishkindha Kanda,38,33,"""Those vanara-s who are combative in wars, and those who can fetch Maithili on eliminating Ravana in war, will be approaching you soon."" Thus Sugreeva informed Rama."
Kishkindha Kanda,38,34,"Then on seeing the perfect effort made by the prominent one among all monkeys, Sugreeva, who is operating under his control, the eyes of valorous prince Rama are widened in jubilance, like the well-bloomed blue-lotuses."
Kishkindha Kanda,39,1,"Rama, the best proponent of probity, happily embraced Sugreeva with both of his arms and replied him who is speaking in this way suppliantly adjoining palms at Rama."
Kishkindha Kanda,39,2,"""There is no wonder, oh, enemy-flamer, if Indra gives rain, or if that thousand-rayed sun makes the sky undark, or if the moon makes night shiny with his moonshine, so also oh, gentle one, if a true-friend of your kind gladdens his indigent-friend, there is no wonder. [3-39-2, 3]"
Kishkindha Kanda,39,4,"""In this way, oh, nice Sugreeva, that helpful nature which is decorously prevailing in you, ushering you for organising the worthwhile, will not be a wonder but natural. I am aware that you have always been the exponent of affability."
Kishkindha Kanda,39,5,"""With you as the helmsman, oh, friend, I will be triumphing over all the enemies, and you alone are worthy to proffer a helping hand to me as a good-hearted friend of mine."
Kishkindha Kanda,39,6,"""That knavish demon Ravana deceitfully carried off Vaidehi for his own extinction, as demon Anuhlaada carried off Sachi Devi, the daughter of Puloma."
Kishkindha Kanda,39,7,"""As soon as possible I wish to eliminate that Ravana with sharp arrows, as has been done by the enemy slyer Indra when he eliminated the insolent father of Sachi Devi, namely Puloma."" Thus Rama is about to tell other things to Sugreeva, but..."
Kishkindha Kanda,39,8,In the meanwhile dust started to overcast the sky covering the intensely scorching radiation of the sun.
Kishkindha Kanda,39,9,"Stained with that darkness the directions are confounded, and the entire earth together with its mountains, woods, and forests has wobbled."
Kishkindha Kanda,39,9,"In a split-second the entire ground is then enshrouded with incalculable fly-jumpers whose size is mountainous, fangs excruciating, and might abnormal, and each monkey commander is surrounded with hundreds of millions of legions of monkeys, who by their wish can change of their guise, and these monkeys of amazing strength have come crashing war-whoops as clouds letting out thunders while they are on their way from their habitation like riversides, seashores, mountains, and some other monkeys have come from forests as they are forest dwellers, and in the vast of masses their complexion alone remained as an identity to their habitation, like the stripe of tender-sun of some monkeys is marking them from the place of rising sun, moon-white body colour of some more telling that they are from the place of nightly moon, and the colour of skin looking like lotus-fibrils of many more indicates that they are from fertile watery lands, and the snow-white complexion of yet some more indicates that the dwelling place of those monkeys is Mt. Meru. [3-39-10, 11, 12, 13]"
Kishkindha Kanda,39,14,"In the meantime the arrival of a distinguished and valorous vanara named Shatabali, hemmed in with ten thousand crores of vanara-s, came into the view of Rama and others."
Kishkindha Kanda,39,15,"Sushena, the father of Lady Tara, a valorous one with the sheen of golden mountain then appeared with very many thousands of crores of vanara-s."
Kishkindha Kanda,39,16,"Like that the most efficient vanara-chief Taara, the father of Ruma and Sugreeva's father-in-law, turned up with another thousand crores of vanara-s following him."
Kishkindha Kanda,39,17,"Honourable Kesari, the father of Hanuma, with his bodily gleam like that of the fibrils of lotuses and visage glittering in the gleam of nascent sun, and who is an intellectual, graceful and prominent vanara among all the vanara-s, then came into view associated with thousands and thousands of armies of vanara-s."
Kishkindha Kanda,39,19,"Gavaaksha, the formidably adventurous sovereign of baboons is then seen encircled by a thousand crore vanara-s."
Kishkindha Kanda,39,20,"Dhuumra, the enemy destroyer, marched to the fore of Rama and others surrounded with two thousand crores of bears which have frightful fastness."
Kishkindha Kanda,39,21,The highly valorous commander named Panasa has then arrived attended by a three crore legion of horrendous vanara-s who are beaming forth like gigantic mountains.
Kishkindha Kanda,39,22,Commander Niila has then come into view with his colossal and blackish mascara mound-like body encircled by ten crores of vanara-s that are selfsame to their leader.
Kishkindha Kanda,39,23,Then the great-mighty commander named Gavaya whose bodily sheen is like that of a golden mountain has come forth surrounded by five crores of vanara-s.
Kishkindha Kanda,39,24,"Dariimukha, the mighty commander then came along with a thousand crore vanara-s and he stayed nearby Sugreeva drawing nigh of him."
Kishkindha Kanda,39,25,"Both Mainda and Dvivida, the great-mighty sons Ashvini-twin gods have then appeared, each with a thousand crore vanara-s."
Kishkindha Kanda,39,26,"The mighty, braving and highly resplendent Gaja came forth to the near of Sugreeva encompassed by three crores of vanara-s."
Kishkindha Kanda,39,27,A great resplendent one who is renowned by his name Jambavanta has then come with a brigade of ten crore bears spreading around him and stood firm under the control of Sugreeva.
Kishkindha Kanda,39,28,A blaze-like mighty vanara named Rumana came swiftly surrounded with a hundred crore legion of vanara-s who are highly venturesome.
Kishkindha Kanda,39,29,Gandhamaadana has then arrived while ten thousand crores and hundred thousand crores of monkeys are following him at his behind.
Kishkindha Kanda,39,30,"Angada, the crown prince of Kishkindha, who matches his father Vali in valour has then turned up with a thousand padma legions and a hundred shanku legions of vanara-s."
Kishkindha Kanda,39,31,"Tara, the vanara-commander, whose sparkle is as that of stars and whose valour is remarkable then appeared at a distance with five crore monkeys."
Kishkindha Kanda,39,32,"Indrajaanu, the brave monkey commander who is the chief of eleven crores of monkeys has appeared then encompassed by selfsame vanara troopers."
Kishkindha Kanda,39,33,Rambha whose bodily glow is like that of tender-sun has then come forth fenced in a thousand plus a hundred of aayuta-s of vanara legions.
Kishkindha Kanda,39,34,A braving and powerful legion commander of vanara-s named Durmukha has then appeared encompassed with two crores of vanara-s.
Kishkindha Kanda,39,35,Then Hanuma appeared with a thousand crore vanara-s encompassing him who in shape are like the summits of Mt. Kailash and whose bravery is formidable.
Kishkindha Kanda,39,36,"Highly vigorous Nala has also arrived while he is surrounded with a hundred crore one thousand and one hundred monkeys, the dwellers on trees."
Kishkindha Kanda,39,37,"Dadhimukha, the salutary vanara-chief then arrived at the near of that great-souled Sugreeva encircled by a ten crore vanara-s who are all blaring highly."
Kishkindha Kanda,39,33,"Sharabha, Kumuda, Vahni, also even Ramha, these and many other vanara-s have come who by their wish are the guise-changers. And many of those other commanders who have presented themselves along with their troops, overspreading the earth inclusive of its mountains and forests, their count is unknown. [3-39-38, 39]"
Kishkindha Kanda,39,40,"All those fly-jumpers arrived by swinging, flying and thundering, and all of the monkeys on earth have arrived thus, presented themselves and settled down around Sugreeva as if a number of clouds are cramming the sun."
Kishkindha Kanda,39,41,"While arriving those monkeys made many a hue and cry of war, and those outstanding monkeys who are armed with a pair of their own arms have informed the vanara king Sugreeva about their arrival by tilting up their heads as in roll-call or in headcount."
Kishkindha Kanda,39,42,"As befitting to them the other vanara leaders have come together to meet Sugreeva, and on their meeting with Sugreeva then they stayed behind with their palms adjoined."
Kishkindha Kanda,39,43,"Then Sugreeva, the knower of rectitude, promptly informed about all of those paramount monkeys to Rama as to who is who, and staying with folded palms he addressed the forgathered monkey chiefs."
Kishkindha Kanda,39,44,"""Oh, chiefs of vanara-s, on procedurally camping your forces everywhere on mountains, at riversides, and in forests according their comfort, the knower of absolute force, Rama, expects to inspect them to infer the forcefulness of your forces."

Kishkindha Kanda,40,2,"""The mighty vanara chiefs who are guise-changers by their wish and who in sheen are like Mahendra, and who dwell in my province have arrived and they are properly encamped too."
Kishkindha Kanda,40,3,"""Those ghastly vanara-chiefs who are a match to the monsters and ogres have arrived with these diversely triumphant, terribly victorious and mighty vanara-soldiers."
Kishkindha Kanda,40,4,"""Oh, Rama, these vanara-s are acclaimed for undertaking impossible deeds, and they will accomplish whatever task they have undertaken. They are powerful ones who have overcome weariness. They are renowned for their confrontation and noteworthy in their manoeuvres. These who are the dwellers on diverse mountains can travel either on earth or on water. Such as they are these vanara-s have come in millionfold as your servants. [4-40-4, 5]"
Kishkindha Kanda,40,6,"""All of them will conduct themselves in orderliness and all abide by the welfare of their king, and oh, Rama, the enemy-repressor, they will be able to discharge whatever task entrusted to them at your discretion."
Kishkindha Kanda,40,7,"""Such of those ghastly vanara-chiefs who are a match to the monsters and ogres have arrived with these diversely triumphant, terribly victorious and mighty vanara-soldiers."
Kishkindha Kanda,40,8,"""Oh, the manly-tiger Rama, whichever you think fit and seasonable that may be said. It will be apt of you to give orders to this vanara force since this has joined up under your command."
Kishkindha Kanda,40,9,"""In fact, this task of yours is known to me in its nature. Even then, it will be apt of you to give them orders as befitting."" Thus Sugreeva spoke to Rama."
Kishkindha Kanda,40,10,"While Sugreeva is speaking thus, Rama the son of Dasharatha heartily hugged him with both of his arms and said this word to him."
Kishkindha Kanda,40,11,"""Oh, gracious Sugreeva, whether Vaidehi is alive or not - it shall be known. Likewise, oh, well-informed one that place in which Ravana dwells - it is to be determined, at the outset."
Kishkindha Kanda,40,12,"""Only on knowing about Vaidehi, also about the dwelling place of Ravana, I will order for the timely action at that time, that too, after deliberating with you."
Kishkindha Kanda,40,13,"""Oh, chief of vanara-s, I am not the master of this task, nor Lakshmana is, but you, oh king of fly-jumpers, are the catalyst and master of this task of searching Seetha."
Kishkindha Kanda,40,14,"""Oh, lord of vanara-s, you alone have to give orders for the right determination of my task, and what my task is, oh, valiant one, you are fully aware of it, isn't it. And it is inoffensive of you to issue orders in this regard."
Kishkindha Kanda,40,15,"""You are a kind-hearted one. To me you are the second-best one, first being Lakshmana. More so, you are a valorous vanara, an intellectual, a knower of the scope of the time and you joined forces with us in our welfare, a partner and a patron of ours, and the best one among all those who are aware of our intentions."" Thus Rama said to Sugreeva."
Kishkindha Kanda,40,15,"When Rama said so, Sugreeva spoke in the presence of Rama and the observant Lakshmana, to a mightiest chief of fly-jumpers, named Vinata, who is a commander of vanara army, who is like a mountain in his sheen and who thunders like a cloud. [4-40-16, 17a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,40,16,"""Oh, Vinata, the best vanara, you are an expert in determining the tasks in consonance with time, place and probity. Hence, you along with vanara-s, whose glow shall be like the moon and sun for they shall be from the progeny of Sun and Moon, and even accompanied with a hundred thousand, say one lakh, other powerful vanara-s, shall go over Eastern direction of the earth inclusive of its mountains, woodlands and forests.

Kishkindha Kanda,40,17,"""There in the East, the forests, mountains and impassable places shall be searched for the princess from Videha kingdom, namely Seetha, and even for the residency of Ravana. [4-40-19b, 20a]"

Kishkindha Kanda,45,9,In this way when despatched by their king Sugreeva all the vanara lieutenants expeditiously started towards one's own direction.

Kishkindha Kanda,46,1,"When the chiefs of monkey-troops are on their way Rama spoke to Sugreeva, ""Indeed, how do you know very-well about the globe of earth in its entirety?"""

Rishyamuka, he did not enter into its precincts at that time fearing Sage Matanga and his curse, oh, king Rama, thus this globe of earth is apparently and closely sighted by me in its entirety, and then I came into the cave of Rishyamuka and did not stir out."" So said Sugreeva to Rama. [4-46-23b, 24]"
Kishkindha Kanda,47,1,As commanded by the king of monkeys Sugreeva all of the elephantine monkeys essayed everywhere with post-hast for a glimpse of Vaidehi.
Kishkindha Kanda,47,2,"Those monkeys have thoroughly searched at lakes, in the pens of creepers on riverbanks, in vacant lands and in crowded cities and at impassable places with rivers and mountains."
Kishkindha Kanda,47,3,"All the monkey commanders explicitly commanded by Sugreeva, very carefully searched all the provinces inclusive of mountains, woodlands, and thick forests of those provinces."
Kishkindha Kanda,47,4,"All the Vanara-s firmed up in finding Seetha have searched nooks and corners of earth by day, and at nighttimes they used to come together onto earth at scheduled places."
Kishkindha Kanda,47,5,"In all those days those Vanara-s used to come to trees which have fruits of all seasons, to make those trees as their beds at bedtime."
Kishkindha Kanda,47,6,"Counting the day of their starting as day one, those elephantine monkeys returned to Mt. Prasavana within one month, hopeless of Seetha, and met Sugreeva, the king of monkeys, who is with Rama awaiting the return of monkeys."
Kishkindha Kanda,47,7,"Cmdr. Vinata, the great-mighty vanara, came back after searching eastern quarter as Sugreeva had advised, but without finding Seetha there."
Kishkindha Kanda,47,8,"Even the valiant and matchless monkey Shatabali explored whole of the northern direction along with his army, but he too came back as Seetha is undiscovered there."
Kishkindha Kanda,47,9,"Sushena, the father-in-law of Sugreeva, searching whole of western quarter along with vanara-s, but not finding Seetha there, he came back when one month is completed, and approached Sugreeva."
Kishkindha Kanda,47,10,All of the expeditionists have reached and venerated Sugreeva who is sitting along with Rama on the peak of Mt. Prasavana and spoke this to him.
Kishkindha Kanda,47,11,"""All of the mountains, all of the serried forests, all of the riversides up to the edge of oceans, likewise, all of the inhabitations have been searched."
Kishkindha Kanda,47,12,"""Those caves that were explicitly extolled by you, they are all thoroughly searched, and immense shrubby hutches that are thickly entwined with climber plants have also been rummaged."
Kishkindha Kanda,47,13,"""Search is conducted in the compacted, lopsided, and impenetrable provinces, and colossal beings are hunted out and killed presuming that Ravana might have assumed those odd shapes, and the impassable provinces are searched high and low, time and again."
Kishkindha Kanda,47,14,"""Hanuma is high-born and exceptionally mighty, oh, Sugreeva, the king of vanara-s, he will ascertain about Maithili, because the son of Air-god, Hanuma, resorted to the direction in which Seetha is taken away."" Thus, monkey chiefs reported to their king Sugreeva."
Kishkindha Kanda,48,1,"Hanuma, the monkey, quickly started along with Angada, Lt. Tara, and others to that province which Sugreeva has indicated, namely the south."
Kishkindha Kanda,48,2,"Arriving at a remote place with all of those powerful monkeys, then Hanuma searched the caves and forests of Vindhya Mountains, and on their mountaintops, at impassable places, at rivers and lakes, and in stands of trees with beamy trees, also on diverse mountains, forests and trees. [4-48-2, 3]"
Kishkindha Kanda,48,4,"Though all of those brave vanara-s have searched in all directions they have not noticed the princess of Mithila and the daughter of Janaka, namely Seetha."
Kishkindha Kanda,48,5,"Feeding upon unalike fruits and tubers, sojourning here and there, those invulnerable vanara-s conducted their search."
Kishkindha Kanda,48,6,"But that province is an inscrutable one, deeply caved, deeply forested, much less of water and still less of people, a void and an impenetrable one with a ghastly look."
Kishkindha Kanda,48,7,"They are highly tormented when they vainly searched there, and even in another province that is also of the same kind, waterless and people-less, and an unreachable one, abstrusely caved and forested."
Kishkindha Kanda,48,8,Then all of those monkey commanders gave up that province and entered another impermeable province as they are fearless from any quarter.
Kishkindha Kanda,48,9,"Whereat the trees are infertile for fruiting, destitute of leaves and flowers, and whereat the brooks are deprived of waters, and whereat it is highly impossible to get even tubers, there they entered."
Kishkindha Kanda,48,10,"Where there are no buffalos, no elephants, no animals, nor even birds or tigers, or no other forest moving beings are there, for they do not have their feed there, they entered such a province."
Kishkindha Kanda,48,10,"Where there are no useful trees, nor herbal plants, nor climbing plants on trees, nor creeping plants on earth, and lotus-lakes which will be normally pleasing for sight have no soft leaves, nor bloomed lotuses on their creepers, and even honeybees are discarding them as they are not richly fragranced, in such a province those vanara-s have entered. [4-48-11,12a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,48,11,"A highly fortunate, veracious, ascetically wealthy sage known as Kandu is there in that province, and that great sage is a highly short-tempered, and an impossible one to subjugate by virtue of his own self-discipline. [4-48-12b, 13a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,48,12,"In that forest that sage lost his son, a ten-year-old boy, as that boy's life ended there by which that great sage is infuriated. [4-48-13b, 14a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,48,13,"Thereby that virtue-souled sage cursed that great forest in it entirety to become an uninhabitable and impermeable forest abandoned by birds and animals. [4-48-14b, 15a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,48,14,"But those monkeys conscientiously searched such a forest up to its fringes, including its mountains, caves, fountains, and rivers. [4-48-15b, 16a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,48,15,"But not finding the daughter of Janaka or even her kidnapper Ravana there, those monkeys who are the perfecters of that which is acceptable to Sugreeva, have entered another fearsome forest. [4-48-16b, 17a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,48,16,"On entering another fearsome forest which is overly encompassed with climbers and shrubberies they saw a demon of fiendish deeds who is fearless of gods. [4-48-17b, 18a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,48,17,"All of those vanara-s are amazed to see that fiendish demon standing similar to a mountainous boulder, and apprehending an imminent danger on observing that mountain similar demon, those vanara-s have tightly girthed their wrestler's girdle-cloth. [4-48-18b, 19a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,48,18,"Even that mighty demon shouting at all vanara-s, 'you are all dead... stay,' rushed towards them shoving up his clenched fist. [4-48-19b, 20a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,48,19,"Angada, the son of Vali, then presumed him who is onrushing as Ravana and saying, 'he is Ravana...' he quickly thwacked that demon indeed with his palm. [4-48-20b, 21a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,48,20,"When Vali's son whacked him that demon spewed forth blood from his throat and fell onto ground alike an inverted mountain. [4-48-21b, 22a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,48,21,"When that demon breathed his last all of those monkeys with triumphal shimmer have wellnigh searched everywhere, and even in that cave of that mountain where that demon appeared, presuming that cave belonged to Ravana. [4-48-22b, 23a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,48,22,"Then all those forest dwelling monkeys searched everywhere else, and like that they entered another horrible cave which is nearby. [4-48-23b, 24a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,48,24,"On searching that cave they came out saddened as their search is futile, and coming together they sat down at the base of a lonely tree downheartedly as their efforts are unsuccessful in searching Seetha."
Kishkindha Kanda,49,1,Then on comforting all of those vanara-s the highly diligent one but overly tired Angada slowly spoke this word to them.
Kishkindha Kanda,49,2,"""We in oneness have searched there and thereabouts in the impassable forests, mountains, and rivers, and unfathomable cavities and in mountain caves up to their end, but we have not seen Janaki, so also that ill-natured demon, the abductor of Seetha, is not seen. [4-49-2, 3]"
Kishkindha Kanda,49,4,"""We started a long time back and a great deal of time is lapsed, and Sugreeva is a severe disciplinarian, therefore let the search continued everywhere collectively."
Kishkindha Kanda,49,5,"""Surrender not to sluggishness, submit not to sorrowfulness, slouch not to sleep, as these lethargies are presently have come up against you. Let all of you search in such a way how best we can find the daughter of Janaka, Seetha."
Kishkindha Kanda,49,6,"""Insistency, ingenuity and indomitability of heart are said to be the causes for achieving results, therefore I am speaking all this."
Kishkindha Kanda,49,7,"""Even now the forest dwellers can search this impenetrable forest, thus get rid of your rue and let all of this forest be searched in its entirety."
Kishkindha Kanda,49,8,"""Fruit of pursuit will definitely be evident for those who undertake an endeavour earnestly, on the other hand, it will be unforgivable to shut our eyes deriving a high dejection."
Kishkindha Kanda,49,9,"""King Sugreeva is irascible and he is a ruthful persecutor too, oh, vanara-s, we shall always be frightened of him, and of self-reliant Rama as well."
Kishkindha Kanda,49,10,"""All this is being said in the interest of your well-being, and if it is obliging to you it may be done in this way as I have said, if not, any other way out is there which will be conducive for all of us, oh, vanara-s, it may be said."" Thus Angada spoke to the troops of monkeys."
Kishkindha Kanda,49,11,"On hearing Angada's words, Gandhamaadana who is enervated with thirst and fatigue spoke this sentence with inexplicit words."
Kishkindha Kanda,49,12,"""What Angada has said that is indeed appropriate, isn't it! It is advantageous and pragmatic also. Let us carry out as said by him."
Kishkindha Kanda,49,13,"""Again let us search out mountains, caves, crags, also like that the uninhabited forests and mountain rapids, too."
Kishkindha Kanda,49,14,"""Let us all collectively search all of the places with forests, mountains and gorges as indicated by that self-assertive Sugreeva."" Thus Gandhamaadana spoke to all monkeys."
Kishkindha Kanda,49,15,Those great-mighty vanara-s again perking themselves up searched the southern compass that is overspread with Vindhya forests.
Kishkindha Kanda,49,15,"Those vanara-s who are the best among monkeys who are desirous of getting a glance of Seetha have clambered up a magnificent Silver Mountain which in statuesque is like an autumnal silvery cloud, and which has many zeniths and caverns, and searched there in the delightful woods of Lodhra trees, and even in the groves of seven-leaved banana plants. [4-49-16, 17]"
Kishkindha Kanda,49,18,"Though they searched everywhere on ascending the mountaintop they have not found Seetha, the dear queen of Rama, and though they are immensely venturesome they are fatigued."
Kishkindha Kanda,49,19,On searching what all they could see all over on that many caved mountain those monkeys descended yet keeping an eye on all over that mountain.
Kishkindha Kanda,49,20,"Then on climbing down the mountain they reached ground and became tired and inane, and staying there for moment they took shelter at the base of a tree."
Kishkindha Kanda,49,21,"They took respite for a moment and when their laboriousness intermitted a little, again they ventured to search the southern direction in its entirety."
Kishkindha Kanda,49,22,"Again making Mt. Vindhya as the starting point of search, those best fly-jumpers, namely Hanuma and the other chieftains of vanara-s, have searched all over the southern direction for Seetha."
Kishkindha Kanda,50,1,"Associated with Angada, Lt. Tara and others, the monkey Hanuma searched the caves and thick forests of Vindhya Range."
Kishkindha Kanda,50,2,"Hanuma has searched in the caves of that kingly Mt. Vindhya, which are jammed in with lions and tigers, and even at the towering rapids. [4-50-2, 3a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,50,3,They reached the southwest peak of that mountain during their search and the time set by Sugreeva swiftly lapsed while they are overstaying thereat that Mt. Vindhya alone.
Kishkindha Kanda,50,4,"Though that extensive province is indeed an unsearchable one with its impenetrable caves and forests, yet Hanuma, the son of Air-god, searched everywhere on that mountain. [4-50-3b, 4]"
Kishkindha Kanda,50,5,"Without pressing one another closely, yet not distancing from one another largely, Gaja, Gavaaksha, Gavaya, Sharabha, Gandhamaadana, also thus Mainda, Dvivida, and Hanuma, and even Jaambavanta, crown prince Angada, also the forest-mover Lt. Tara have searched that province in southern direction that is encompassed with interlocked mountains, and during their search there they have observed a wide-opened and impassable cavity known as Riksha cavity which is well guarded by a demon called Maya. [4-50-5, 6, 7, 8a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,50,6,"Thirst and hunger invading them they are fatigued and craving for water, and such as they are they beheld that capacious cavity which is enwrapped in climbers and trees. [4-50-8, 9a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,50,7,"There they have seen the swans and the waterfowls like Kraunca, Saarasa, and even Cakravaka waterfowls exiting from the cavity with their bodies drenched in water and reddened with the dapples of lotuses' pollen. [4-50-9b, 10a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,50,8,"When those best vanara-s have neared that fragrant and impermeable cavity they are disheartened with amazement. [4-50-10b, 11a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,50,9,"Though a suspicion in general is evoked in them, as they presumed that cavity to be Naraka, The Hell of Yama, or Paataala, the Netherworld of Emperor Bali, those highly resplendent and great mighty fly-jumpers have neared it, rejoicing for the availability of water in there. [4-50-11b, 12a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,50,10,"That hideous cavity is dispersed with diverse beings, similar to the residence of the emperor of demons, namely Emperor Bali, in Paataala, the Netherworld, and it is unsightly and impermeable from anywhere. [4-50-12b, 13a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,50,11,"The son of Air-god Hanuma whose glossiness is like that of a mountaintop and who is a mastermind in scrutinising every inscrutable forest, then spoke to all of the formidable Vanara-s. [4-50-13b, 14a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,50,12,"""We all have searched the southern quarter including those places that are enmeshed with meshes of mountains, and we are overly fatigued, but Maithili is unnoticed. [4-50-14b, 15a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,50,13,"""Swans along with waterfowls like Saarasa, Kruanca, and water drenched Cakravaka birds are coming out of this cavity from all over, and even the trees available at its doorway are verdant. Certainly there must be a wellspring, or otherwise a pond with water."" Thus Hanuma spoke to all monkeys. [4-50-15b, 16, 17a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,50,14,"When Hanuma spoke to them thus as a kind of assurance, all those monkeys entered the cavity and found it as a sunless or moonless cavity, enfolded in hair-raising darkness. [4-50-17b, 18a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,50,15,"Those tigerly monkeys have also seen lions and various other animals and birds exiting therefrom, and entered that cavity which is enshrouded in obscurity. [4-50-18b, 19a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,50,16,"Their eyesight, or their vigour, or their valorousness is rendered ineffectual, and their permeation is just like the directionless air as their eyesight is thwarted in gloominess."
Kishkindha Kanda,50,17,"Despite of the gloominess of that cavity, unobstructed is their eyesight, or their vigour or their valorousness, and their permeation is like that of the gust of air as their eyesight is actuated even in darkness. [4-50-19, 20a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,50,18,"But on their going further into that cavity speedily, those elephantine monkeys beheld a best place that is luminous, as well as lovely. [4-50-20b, 21a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,50,19,"In that awful cave that is compacted with various trees, then they advanced further an interstice of yojana distance, hand in hand lest one may miss the other. [4-50-21b, 22a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,50,20,"Though they are craving for water, highly perplexed, and lost track of their destination or any waterway, and yet hopeful of their mission they unwearyingly hopped in that cavity for a good while. [4-50-22b, 23a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,50,21,"Those fly-jumpers are presently enervated and overly tired, and sad faced, and when those brave ones are despaired of their life, just then they perceived a luminescence. [4-50-23b, 24a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,50,22,"Those amenable monkeys on arriving at that province then beheld a shadowless woodland with golden trees which in irradiance is like the irradiated Ritual-fire. They beheld Saala, Taala [Palmyra,] Tamaala trees and some flowered trees like Punnaaga, Vanjula, Dhava, Campaka, Naaga, also Karnikaara trees. The bunches of their flowers are golden and amazing, leaflets are reddish, and like that the climbers enwreathing at their tops are like their towering diadems and since those trees have golden fruits, they look as though decorated with golden jewellery. Those golden-bodied tress are shining forth like tender sun and their pedestals are completely studded with lapis gems. The birds encircling those trees are in the hue of lapis lazuli gems. The lotus lakes are encompassed with golden lotuses with broad petals, which in shine are similar to tender sun. [4-50-24b, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,50,23,"Then they beheld there the lotus-lakes containing serene waters and stocky lotuses and burly fishes that are golden. [4-50-29b, 30a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,50,24,"There the monkeys beheld choicest mansions everywhere made out of gold and silver, some with golden and some with silver domes, while some with golden and some with silver multi-stories, but all are studded with lapis gems with golden windows covered with laceworks of pearls. [4-50-30b-32a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,50,25,"They have also seen everywhere flowered and fruited trees that are similar in shine to red corals and rubies, and golden honeybees, as well as honeys. [4-50-32b, 33a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,50,26,"They beheld everywhere diverse and capacious beds and seats that are amazingly crafted with gemstones and gold, and also stacks of utensils made of gold, silver and bell metal. [4-50-33b, 34]"
Kishkindha Kanda,50,35,"They saw the stockpiles of heavenly aloe vera substances and sandalwood sticks and depurated eatables, tubers and fruits."
Kishkindha Kanda,50,28,"They have also seen top-grade soft drinks, luscious honeys, heaps of finest quality clothing, exotic blankets and sheaves of deerskins. [4-50-36, 37a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,50,29,"Vanara-s have also observed mounds of undefiled gold stockpiled here and there glowing with the glow of ritual fire. [4-50-37b, 38a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,50,30,"When searching here and there in that cavity those valiant vanara-s of high resplendence have perceived some lady rather not far from them. [4-50-38b, 39a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,50,31,"They saw a sainted lady there who is attired in jute-cloths and who is on a controlled diet and who is like a luminiferous entity by her own luminescence of asceticism. [4-50-38b, 39a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,50,32,"In wonderment the monkeys stood still all over, and in the matter of her identity Hanuma asked her, ""Who are you? Whose cavity is this, either? [4-50-40b, 40c]"
Kishkindha Kanda,50,41,"Then Hanuma whose shine is similar to that of a mountain making palm-fold and reverencing that aged lady asked, ""Who are you? Whose is this cavity, or the mansion or these jewels? Please speak."""
Kishkindha Kanda,51,1,"Thus, Hanuma on saying therein [that subject,] again spoke to that most reverential and sainted lady who is dressed in black deerskin and conducting herself in probity."
Kishkindha Kanda,51,2,"""Overtired with hunger and thirst we are overawed anywise, and we suddenly entered this cavity, which is overspread with darkness..."" [Thus Hanuma is speaking to her.]"
Kishkindha Kanda,51,3,"""We entered this extensive hollow of earth thirstily, but on seeing this kind of these diverse and marvellous mansions we are verily amazed [presuming that this is a dominion of some demon,] and we are agitated [in not knowing dos and don'ts,] and agonised [at our incarceration...] whose trees are all these golden ones, splendent like young sun... [4-51-3, 4]"
Kishkindha Kanda,51,4,"""The edibles, tubers, and fruits are all depurated... golden are the aircrafts... mansions silvern... ventilators golden and encased in jewelly laces... [4-51-5, 6a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,51,5,"""Flowered and fruited and also aromatically scented are these auspicious and completely golden trees... by whose splendour [they are rendered thus?] [4-51-6b, 7a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,51,6,"""Also how the lotuses born in limpid water are golden, and how the fishes along with tortoises are ostensibly golden? [4-51-7b, 8a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,51,7,"""Or, is all this owing to the innate prodigy of yours or to whose ascesis' prowess all this is owed... as all of us are oblivious of it, so it will be apt of you to narrate all of it..."" [Thus Hanuma requested that sainted lady.] [4-51-8b, 9a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,51,8,"Thus when Hanuma addressed her, that sainted lady, and a blissful one in the well being of all the beings, she replied Hanuma. [4-51-9b, 10a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,51,9,"""A marvellous fantasist by name Maya was there, a bullish demon of wizardry and by him with his phenomenal expertise all this golden woodland is constructed..."" [Thus, that sainted lady started her narration.] [4-51-10b]"
Kishkindha Kanda,51,11,"""Once he was the Universal Craftsman to the lords of demons by whom this divinely golden and superb mansion was constructed..."
Kishkindha Kanda,51,11,"""But he on practising ascesis for thousands of years in this horrendous forest, obtained a boon from Brahma, the Forefather, [which entails acquirement of] entire wealth of Sage Shukra..."
Kishkindha Kanda,51,12,"""But he on practising ascesis for thousands of years in this horrendous forest, obtained a boon from Brahma, the Forefather, [which entails acquirement of] entire wealth of those people, who immoderately and avariciously beseech all the available gods, to accord all wealth to them only...[4-51-12b, 13a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,51,13,"""That dynamic one methodised everything and then resided comfortably in this great forest for some time, privileged with all his wishes... [4-51-13b, 14a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,51,14,"""Indra, the Administrator of Worlds and destroyer of enemy citadels, on taking His Thunderbolt eliminated Maya, when that eminent demon was engaged with an apsara, a paradisiacal nymph, called Hema... [4-51-14b, 15a]"

Kishkindha Kanda,52,1,"When those monkey commanders are relaxed after refreshments, then that sainted lady, who concentrates single-mindedly and who is a pursuer of probity, spoke this word to all of them."
Kishkindha Kanda,52,2,"""Oh, vanara-s, if your enervation is eased off by devouring fruits, and if I may listen to that episode of yours, I wish to listen to it."" Thus Swayamprabha addressed the monkeys."
Kishkindha Kanda,52,3,"Hanuma, the son of Air-god, sincerely started to narrate their episode in its pithiness on hearing her words."
Kishkindha Kanda,52,4,"""The king of all the world and one similar to Mahendra and Rain-god, such an illustrious Rama of Dasharatha entered Dandaka forest with his bother Lakshmana, even along with his wife Vaidehi, but Ravana coercively abducted his wife from Janasthaana. [4-52-4, 5]"
Kishkindha Kanda,52,6,"""A valiant one and the king of important vanara-s known as Sugreeva is a vanara and the friend of that kingly Rama, and that vanara king expedited us."
Kishkindha Kanda,52,6,"""He mobilised us along with these important vanara-s and Angada as helmsman to this southerly prospect, which is the walkabout of Sage Agastya and watched over by Yama, the Death-god, saying, 'you all shall collectively search for Seetha of Videha kingdom together with the demon Ravana, a guise-changer by his wish.'

Kishkindha Kanda,52,9,"""On searching out the southerly direction in its entirety we are all hungered and we all gathered around at a tree-stem."
Kishkindha Kanda,52,10,"""All of us were whey-faced, all of us were preoccupied with propositions, thus deluged in the depthless deep of our despair we could not overreach the other shore of our oceanic despair."
Kishkindha Kanda,52,11,"""Then straggling our eyes we perceived this wide cavity wrapped up with vines and woods and enwrapped in darkling."
Kishkindha Kanda,52,12,"""Swans, water-hawks, saarasa-waterfowls were coming out of this cavity drenched in water and sprinkling drops of water with the flaps of their wings."

Kishkindha Kanda,52,14,"""As our task was hastening us then we all readied ourselves to fall in the cavity by tightly clasping each other's hand, and then we fell in this cavity."
Kishkindha Kanda,52,13,"""Thus we readily entered this Black Cavity, and this much is our activity in here as we all have come here by our escapade for water, and we neared you when we were ravenous and retrogressing. [4-52-15, 16a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,52,16,"""And we who are overly harassed by hunger have devoured the fruits and tubers you have offered with the grace of your hospitality."
Kishkindha Kanda,52,15,"""You have rescued all of us who were on the verge of hunger-deaths, and what is to be done by vanara-s for you in requital that you may please tell."" Thus Hanuma spoke to that sainted lady. [4-52-17b, 18a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,52,16,"When she is spoken thus by those vanara-s then that omniscient Swayamprabha replied this to all of the vanara commanders. [4-52-18b, 19a]"

Kishkindha Kanda,52,22,"When Hanuma said thus that sainted lady said sentence, ""I believe outgoing is impracticable for the incomers in aliveness from this cavity. [4-52-25b, 26a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,52,23,"""By the sublime efficacy of ascesis acquired through my practices of numerous self-restraints I wish to sail all of the vanara-s through the incarceration, called this cavity. [4-52-26b, 27a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,52,24,"""All of you best vanara-s shall close up your eyelids, for it is indeed impossible to attempt an exit with unclose eyes."" Thus that sainted lady said to monkeys. [4-52-27b, 28a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,52,25,"Then all of those desirers of departure are gladdened and immediately shut their eyelids, and further they lidded them with their delicately fingered hands. [4-52-28b, 29a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,52,26,She then sailed those noble souled vanara-s who covered their faces with their hands through that cavity barely within a minute. [4-52-29b. 30a]
Kishkindha Kanda,52,27,"That virtuous and sainted lady on comforting all of the monkeys, who are taken out of that precarious cavity, spoke this to them at the exterior of cavity. [4-52-30b, 31a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,52,28,"""This one which is surrounded by diverse trees and vines is the magnificent Vindhya Mountain, this mountain is Prasravana, and this vast expanse of water is the southerly ocean. Now I wish to return to my mansion... oh, best vanara-s, let safety betide you."" saying thus Swayamprabha the Sainted Lady, re-entered the ostentatious cavity, called Riksha Bila. [4-52-31b, 32]"
Kishkindha Kanda,53,1,"Then they saw an inexorable ocean, the realm of Rain-god, tumultuous with out-roaring and implacable waves, and shoreless otherwhere."
Kishkindha Kanda,53,2,"Which month is set as timeframe for the monkeys by king Sugreeva that month passed off while the monkeys are searching mountains, impassable areas and within the cavity concocted by the wizardry of demon Maya."
Kishkindha Kanda,53,3,Sitting on a foothill of Mt. Vindhya which is with fully flowered trees those virtue-souled monkeys are then driven in desperation.
Kishkindha Kanda,53,4,"Then on seeing the treetops of spring season, weighty with flowers and enshrouded with hundreds of vines, they became incredulous with the fright of failing Sugreeva's timeframe."
Kishkindha Kanda,53,5,"On discussing among themselves they found that spring season has arrived, and they also found the purpose of timely messaging about Seetha to Sugreeva is lost, thus they plumped down onto the surface of earth."
Kishkindha Kanda,53,6,"The crown prince and a great foreseer Angada, the monkey, whose nape of neck is leonine and bullish, arms lengthy and sturdy, then as usual paying respects to elderly monkeys greeted all of the forest dwellers and spoke this sentence in a modest voice. [4-53-6, 7]"
Kishkindha Kanda,53,8,"""Oh, monkeys, we all have started at the command of the king of monkeys, and the month fixed by him is zeroed out while we were in Black Cavity. Are you aware of it?"" Thus Angada started to speak his mind."
Kishkindha Kanda,53,9,"""We were sent out scheduling time calculating from the month of aashviiyuja nearly October. Even that time fixed for us has also lapsed. Thereby, what is to be done next?"
Kishkindha Kanda,53,10,"""You all the pioneers in the pathway of principles, you have notched up the credibility of your king, you are all well-disposed in the well-being of your king, and you are the contrivers of any exploit."
Kishkindha Kanda,53,11,"""All of you are unparalleled in all tasks, all your asperity is renowned in all directions, and all of you have come impelled by that ochreish eyed Sugreeva keeping me as your helmsman."
Kishkindha Kanda,53,12,"""As of now our mission is incomplete hence we are scheduled to die, and there is no doubt about it. Who can be complacent by keeping the directive of monkey's king incomplete?"
Kishkindha Kanda,53,13,"""But in this matter of course, as the time set by Sugreeva is lapsed, it is appropriate for all of us forest dwelling monkeys to voluntarily undertake fasting unto death."
Kishkindha Kanda,53,14,"""Instinctively Sugreeva is a tormentor and now he is institutionalised in lordship, thus he will not condone any of us as we will be as good as transgressors if we were to return."
Kishkindha Kanda,53,14,"""Sugreeva commits sin alone in our respect by killing all of us as we failed in the facts about Seetha, therefore it is pertinent to enter upon fasting unto, leaving off our sons, wives, riches and houses and homes, too. [4-53-15, 16a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,53,15,"""That king Sugreeva definitely and freakishly tortures all of us on our going back futilely, hence suicide at this place is justifiable for all us. [4-53-16b, c]"
Kishkindha Kanda,53,16,"""I am not anointed to crown-princedom by Sugreeva, but I am anointed by the unbigoted Rama, the king of people. [4-53-17b, 18a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,53,17,"""That king Sugreeva who is already bound up in animosity with my father, and thus with me too, now on observing me transgressing his directive will decisively wish to liquidate me by a tyrannous victimisation. [4-53-18a, 19a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,53,18,"""Of what use is the witnessing of my kith and kin at me when I am tortured in the prime of my life, hence here on this sacred seashore alone I will outwait my death fasting unto it."" Thus Angada said to all the monkeys. [4-53-19b, c]"
Kishkindha Kanda,53,20,"On hearing all that uttered by that youngish Angada, the crown prince, all of those prominent Vanara-s sympathetically spoke these words."
Kishkindha Kanda,53,20,"""Instinctively Sugreeva is a hot-tempered vanara and Raghava is interested in his beloved wife. The timeframe is lapsed and Vaidehi is unspotted. If we go back to Kishkindha now, on seeing us returning without completing our assignment, and with a thinking to satisfy Rama Sugreeva wishes to liquidate us without any doubt. [4-53-21, 22]"
Kishkindha Kanda,53,23,"""It will be inexcusable for the culprits to pass at the sideways of lords, then where is the question of their coming into king's audience, and we should be barefaced to return because we are all the chieftains of Sugreeva who are coordinated and sent here."
Kishkindha Kanda,53,24,"""If we do not return to that champion Sugreeva on searching somewhere here for Seetha, or on our educing some information about her, we will rather enter the realm of Yama, the Terminator."" Thus the other monkeys discussed among themselves."
Kishkindha Kanda,53,25,"On hearing the words of fly-jumpers, who are tormented by fear of Sugreeva, Lt. Tara spoke this to them, ""enough is your desperation, if you all are interested let us enter that cave again where we can live."
Kishkindha Kanda,53,26,"""That highly impassable cavity is contrived by the demon Maya and it is abundant with trees, water, eatables and potables, and there is no fear even from Indra in that cavity, nor from Raghava, nor from Sugreeva, the king of monkeys."" So said Lt. Tara to all."
Kishkindha Kanda,53,27,"On hearing Angada's words, as well as the words of Lt. Tara that are trended to Angada's words, all the monkeys compliantly spoke with believability, ""in which way we all will not be killed that way may be waymarked, and promptly make it happen now only."" So said all the monkeys to Angada."
Kishkindha Kanda,54,1,"When Lt Tara whose resplendence is similar to moonshine has spoken that way, then Hanuma deemed that Angada is laying siege to that kingdom of Vanaras. [4541]"
Kishkindha Kanda,54,2,"Hanuma considered Vali's son Angada indeed as having eightfold intelligence, fourfold tactics, fourteen traits. [4542]"
Kishkindha Kanda,54,3,"Angada who is steadily brimming over with his spiritedness, mightiness, valorousness, and waxing like the moon starting from day one of White Fortnight of a month, who is comparable to Brihaspati, the Jupiter, in sagacity, who mirrors up his father Vali in intrepidity, but who is now assiduously attentive to the rebellious teachings of Lt. Tara, like Indra who once listened to the unlistenable teachings of demon's mentor, namely Shukraacaarya, as that Angada is overly enervated to fulfil the concerns of the king Sugreeva. Then Hanuma who is the scholar in all scriptures started to confederate the confidence of Angada with the present regime of Sugreeva. [4543, 4, 5]"
Kishkindha Kanda,54,4,"Hanuma then rhetorically started to the schismatic secession of all those vanaras, who are desirous of avoiding Sugreeva and desiring a hideout, exemplifying the third ideation, namely the partition, among the four political ideations, viz., placation, presentation, partition, persecution. [4546]"
Kishkindha Kanda,54,5,"When Hanuma made all of the vanaras to defect from Angada's idea of defecting Sugreeva, then Hanuma further overawed Angada with diverse and awesome orations containing the fourth ideation, namely the persecutory measures, employable by Sugreeva on defectors. [4547]"
Kishkindha Kanda,54,6,"""As with your father you are undeniably abler in warfare, oh, the son of Lady Tara, and as with your father you are unquestionably capable enough to sustain the monkey kingdom."" Thus Hanuma started to address Angada. [4548]"
Kishkindha Kanda,54,7,"""Oh, best monkey, Angada, monkeys will be inconsistent at their will, isn't it! Separated from their sons and wives they cannot tolerate to remain under your control for a long. [4549]"
Kishkindha Kanda,54,8,"""I plainly tell you what is obvious. This Jambavanta, these monkeys like Niila, and great monkey Suhotra and others do not definitely tagalong you, isn't it. Likewise I too do not definitely tagalong you. Such as we are, it will be impossible for you to sidetrack us from Sugreeva using tactics like placation, presentation or even persecution, isn't so! [45410, 11]"
Kishkindha Kanda,54,9,"""Even if a mightless is at odds with the mighty he can linger on, so to speak, therefore guard yourself, for no mediocrity will be at odds... [45412]"
Kishkindha Kanda,54,10,"""This matter of going underground into that Black Hole which you suppose as a hideout from Sugreeva, as you heard from Lt. Tara and others, but it is a deed of trifle to Lakshmana's arrows, not necessarily for Rama's arrows, in splitting apart whole of that Black Hole in a trice. [45413]"
Kishkindha Kanda,54,11,"""Indeed, once Indra thudded his Thunderbolt on this very underground illusory place, but that act was indeed a trivial deed for that Thunderbolt made a single demonsized aperture to eliminate a single demon, Maya, which we now call Riksha bila, Black Hole, nevertheless Lakshmana will splinter whole of this Black Hole with his acute arrows, as if it is leafy bowl. [45414]"
Kishkindha Kanda,54,12,"""There are numerous ironarrows with Lakshmana that are kindred to Thunderbolt of Indra, whose punch will be equalling that of Thunderbolt and Lightning Flashes, and which are the splitters of mountains. [45415]"
Kishkindha Kanda,54,13,"""As and when you settle down in that underground, more so, an unbefitting place for a crown prince, oh, enemyburner Angada, then and there all the monkeys will desert you resolvedly. [45416]"
Kishkindha Kanda,54,14,"""Always sulking and reminiscing on their sons and wives, and hungered for the proximity of their kinfolk and hungered for diverse palatability as any monkey would cherish, even so, lamenting on the beds of lament they push you backwards. [45417]"
Kishkindha Kanda,54,15,"""Devoid of goodhearted friends and wellwishing relatives, you will become highly sullen in solitariness. Such as you are you will end up as a highly frightened monkey, even from the shaking of a piece of straw."
Kishkindha Kanda,54,16,"""Devoid of goodhearted friends and wellwishing relatives, you will become highly sullen in solitariness. Such as you are you will end up as a highly frightened monkey and you will end up much the same as a seamy shaky piece of straw. [45418]"
Kishkindha Kanda,54,17,"""By far, those fiercely frantic arrows of Lakshmana if targeted to kill you, in case you become a sidestepper from loyalties, will be terrifyingly twingeing. Further, those fierily frenetic arrows are irreversible. [45419]"
Kishkindha Kanda,54,18,"""But, if you return to Kishkindha along with us, and if you obediently become Sugreeva's flanker, he establishes you only in kingdom as before. [45420]"
Kishkindha Kanda,54,19,"""Your paternaluncle Sugreeva's gleam is his honesty as he is free of dishonesty, his desire is affection as he is free of aversion, his dedication is staunch as he is free of prevarication, and he himself is exoneration as he is free from exploitation, thus in no way he liquidates you. [45421]"
Kishkindha Kanda,54,20,"""He is your mother's wellwisher, the strife of Sugreeva's life is for her only, more so, there is no other posterity to him than you. Oh, Angada, therefore go back to Kishkindha, rather than deflecting, deviating and deserting your own kingdom. [45422]"
Kishkindha Kanda,55,1,"On hearing the polite and righteous words of Hanuma, which are just yeomanly towards Hanuma's lord, namely Sugreeva, Angada said these sentences."
Kishkindha Kanda,55,2,"""Un-deducible in Sugreeva are his steadiness, or harmlessness, or frankness, also thus salience, or even valiance, further more cleanliness of heart or soul."
Kishkindha Kanda,55,3,"""Which Sugreeva has arrogated his elder brother's wife when that elder brother is still alive and well, where she is morally his motherlike, an empress and a lady love of that elder brother, thus he is despicable, and which Sugreeva closed the mouth of the cavity when his brother in all his belief assigned and stationed him alone at the mouth of the cavity to fightback the demon Dundubhi if he tries to escape, all the more when his own brother is still inside the cavity, thus he is nefarious, how then he can be said as one conversant with moral rectitude? [4-55-3, 4]"
Kishkindha Kanda,55,5,"""Which Sugreeva has overlooked no less than the great glorious Raghava, whom he truthfully befriended and from whom his own task of arrogating my kingdom by eliminating my father is facilitated, how then can he remember the good services of others like us?"
Kishkindha Kanda,55,6,"""He has ordered and sent us for searching Seetha owing to the fear from Lakshmana, but not as a coward fearing his own unscrupulousness, how then can scrupulosity be manifest in him?"
Kishkindha Kanda,55,7,"""Who is that respectable one who can put belief in Sugreeva, while that Sugreeva is shameful by his shameless act of eliminating my father, and unmindful of tradition in usurping my mother and throne, and unthankful in requiting Rama by himself, instead of using us as pawns, and changeful in ignoring his promise to Rama, but in fearing for Lakshmana? Will it be possible especially for one like me belonging to his family?"
Kishkindha Kanda,55,8,"""Whether a son is honest or dishonest he alone is investable in the kingdom. How then can Sugreeva let me, the one from the family of his enemy, live on?"
Kishkindha Kanda,55,9,"""My slyness in planning to live in Black Hole has backfired, I am now culpable in not finding Seetha being the troop leader, and I am a powerless as you all are Sugreeva's side, how then can I live on indeed after reaching Kishkindha, like caitiff turned into a wretch."
Kishkindha Kanda,55,10,"""Indeed he surceases me by some mysterious trammelling punishment, for that Sugreeva becomes disingenuous, ferocious, also barbarous just for the reason of his kingship."
Kishkindha Kanda,55,11,"""Fast unto death behoves me than trammels and tramples, thus you all be acquiescent to my proposal and you may go back to your dwellings."
Kishkindha Kanda,55,12,"""I am reiterating to you all that I do not wish to go to the city of Kishkindha, and here only I sit fasting unto death, as death alone is expedient to me."
Kishkindha Kanda,55,12,"""On my behalf Raghava-s wellbeing may be enquired firstly paying deference to them, so also the wellbeing of my paternal uncle and king may be enquired, only after paying deference to that lord of vanara-s. [4-55-13, 14a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,55,13,"""My step-mother Ruma may be asked after regarding her healthiness. And it will be apt of you to solace my mother Lady Tara, who by her nature is a warm-hearted and austerely lady who cherishes her son more, and such as she is she will obviously leave off her life on hearing that I breathed my last."" So said Angada to all monkeys. [4-55-14b, 16a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,55,14,"On speaking to that point and after paying deference to older vanara-s available there, Angada puling glum facedly reclined on the sacred grass spread on ground. [4-55-16b, 17a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,55,15,"Apropos to Angada's recumbency on ground, the other outstanding Vanara-s snivellingly sluiced down seethingly effusive teardrops emotionally. [4-55-17b, 18a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,55,16,"While disesteeming Sugreeva but esteeming Vali, all of the vanara-s have gathered around Angada deciding to sit down for fasting unto death in step with Angada. [4-55-18b, 19a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,55,17,"Those best ones among fly-jumpers on discerning the words of Angada, the son of Vali, and agreeing to what all said by Angada as appropriate, they positioned themselves on the sacred grass after touching waters sacramentally. The sacred-grass is spread as sacred beds to cast off their lives. The edges of grass blades are positioned southward. As they are on that northern shore of southern ocean, all those best monkeys who are bent on to self-immolation, they became recumbent facing eastward. [4-55-19b, 21a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,55,18,"An unknown apprehensive dread came upon those monkeys when they discussed Rama's living in forests, Dasharatha's demise, calamity caused to Janasthaana, casualty to Jataayu, like that the stealing of Vaidehi and slaying of Vali. [4-55-21, 22]"
Kishkindha Kanda,55,23,"While those many fly-jumpers who mirror up great mountaintops by their physique are recumbent discussing stridently, the entrails of caves of mountain are rendered strident, and that mountain itself appeared like skyscape filled with strident clouds about to burst a good fortune."
Kishkindha Kanda,56,1,"At which mountain's tableland those monkeys sat down for self-immolation, to that area the elder brother of Jataayu, a kingly eagle known as Sampaati by name, one renowned one for his forcefulness and aggressiveness, and a celebrated and sempiternal sky-flying eagle has arrived. [4-56-1, 2]"
Kishkindha Kanda,56,3,"On coming out of the cave of the great-mountain Vindhya, Sampaati is gladden at heart to see the monkeys sitting down there, and he spoke these words."
Kishkindha Kanda,56,4,"""Whether it is good or bad, fate indeed follows humans in this world procedurally, why because, this fated and long-waited food has now come nigh of me..."
Kishkindha Kanda,56,5,"""I wish to eat them frugally, killing one by one and eating one by one, preying on one on one day, and then preying upon the other on the other day..."" thus that bird spoke those words on seeing the massy fly-jumpers."
Kishkindha Kanda,56,6,"On hearing the words of that gormandising bird, Angada became highly breathless and then spoke to Hanuma."
Kishkindha Kanda,56,7,"""Look! In the name of an eagle, the son of the Sun, Yama, the Terminator, has manifestly arrived at this area for the fatality of monkeys... thus ill luck is still haunting us..."
Kishkindha Kanda,56,8,"""We fulfilled neither Rama's task, nor the decree of our king, but this unknown catastrophe has abruptly bechanced for the monkeys..."
Kishkindha Kanda,56,9,"""You all have heard in its entirety what deed the kingly Jataayu has done wishing to do good to Vaidehi..."
Kishkindha Kanda,56,10,"""Like that all beings, even those birthed in animality, are doing what that is agreeable to Rama even on forgoing their own lives, as with us..."
Kishkindha Kanda,56,11,"""Even animals will be mutually succouring by their instinct of concern and camaraderie, therefore, let each of us leave off our souls, soulfully..."
Kishkindha Kanda,56,11,"""Conscientious Jataayu has done a deed much liked by Rama, and we too have been trekking the forests without caring even for our lives in the cause of Rama, but we have not seen Maithili... [4-56-12, 13a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,56,12,"""He that kingly eagle Jataayu who is killed by Ravana is a happy soul, and he is even relieved from the fear of Sugreeva as he departed on the Avenue of Sublimity... [4-56-13b, c]"

Kishkindha Kanda,56,14,"""Just by giving boons to Kaikeyi, the quandaries like Rama's dwelling in forests along with Seetha and Lakshmana, as a result Rama's fury eliminating complete demons of Janasthaana, and as a result Raghava's arrow exterminating Val, have come to pass."" Thus Angada is lamenting. [4-56-15,16]"
Kishkindha Kanda,56,17,"On observing the monkeys who lay recumbent on ground and on hearing them eulogising the death of Jataayu he that king of eagles Sampaati is highly perturbed at that uncomfortable information about Jatayu, and that high minded Sampaati sorrowfully spelled out this word."
Kishkindha Kanda,56,18,That shredder-billed eagle Sampaati said this sentence voicing thunderously on hearing words voiced by Angada.
Kishkindha Kanda,56,19,"""Who speaks to announce as though to quake my heart that Jatayu, the more precious brother of mine than my own lives, is slain?"
Kishkindha Kanda,56,20,"""How a combat occasioned between that eagle and a demon in Janasthaana, and how am I hearing this name of my brother after a long time..."

Kishkindha Kanda,56,22,"""I am incapable to spread my wings widely as they are burnt by Sun's rays, hence oh, enemy-chasteners, I wish you to lower me down from this mountain..."" Thus Sampaati sought for the help of monkeys. [4-56-24b, c]"
Kishkindha Kanda,57,1,"Though Sampaati's voice is turned husky by his sadness for the demise of his brother Jataayu, the monkey commanders doubtingly disbelieved neither him nor even his words by the fact of his being an eagle intending to kill and eat up all the monkeys."
Kishkindha Kanda,57,2,"On seeing the eagle those fly-jumpers who sat for fast-unto-death have become furious at the eagle thinking that, ""that eagle wishes to eat up all of us..."" Thus, the monkeys deliberated the eagle's words."
Kishkindha Kanda,57,3,"""We are sitting for fast-unto-death and if that eagle wishes eat us let it be so... then our deliverance will be achieved in anyway and we will go to heaven from here..."" Thus, some other monkeys gave thought to lower that eagle down."
Kishkindha Kanda,57,4,"When all of the monkey chiefs made up their mind in this way, then some of them on going to the mountaintop brought that eagle down, and then Angada spoke to the eagle."
Kishkindha Kanda,57,5,"""Oh, bird, my noble grandfather is known as Rikshaja who was a valorous and an outstanding monkey among all monkeys, was the king of monkeys.

The third flight level is that of the wading birds like Bhaasa, Kraunca, Kurara birds and cranes, herons and the like. The fourth flight level is that of hawks and the fifth is that of the vultures.

Kishkindha Kanda,65,1,"Then on hearing the words of Angada those best vanara-s, anamely Gaja, Gavaaksha, Gavaya, Sharabha, Gandhamaadana, Mainda and Dvivida, and Susheshana, and like that Jambavanta have individually said about their abilities in the matter of leaping the ocean according to their turn."
Kishkindha Kanda,65,3,"In that matter Gaja said, ""I can fly ten yojana-s..."" and Gavaaksha said, ""I can go over twenty yojana-s..."""
Kishkindha Kanda,65,4,"In that matter the vanara Sharabha said to the monkeys, ""oh, fly-jumpers, I can indeed go up to thirty yojana-s..."" The vanara Sharabha said, ""I can go up to forty yojana-s, undoubtedly..."" The great-resplendent Gandhamaadana said, ""I can go up to fifty yojana-s, no doubt..."" The vanara Mainda said the monkeys in that matter, ""I venture to jump just sixty yojana-s..."" Then the great-resplendent Dvivida informed, ""I can go up to seventy yojana-s, no doubt..."" But mighty Shushena, the best and the great resplendent monkey said, ""I promise to jump eighty yojana-s..."""
Kishkindha Kanda,65,10,"Jambavanta, the oldest one among all of them, appreciating them who are telling about their jumping capacities, has informed them in this way."
Kishkindha Kanda,65,11,"""Previously there was some traversal daredevilry even for us, such as we were, we are presently on the other shore of our age..."
Kishkindha Kanda,65,12,"""That being so, for which purpose the king of monkeys Sugreeva and even Rama are decisively decided on this task, it is impossible for us to marginalize this task..."
Kishkindha Kanda,65,13,"""While we say you may hear what cruise we have at this age... we can go up to ninety yojana-s, undoubtedly..."
Kishkindha Kanda,65,14,"Jambavanta further said this to all of those best monkeys, ""my capability in the stint of going was not definitely limited only thereunto..."
Kishkindha Kanda,65,15,"""Once I have performed circumambulation around the Omnipresent and Eternal Vishnu in His incarnation as Trivikrama, when He grandiosely increased His physique from that of a Divine-Dwarfish Brahman boy to that of an Omnidirectional Being, thus filling whole of the Universe to tread all the three worlds, during the time of Vedic-ritual of Emperor Bali, the legatee of Vairocana..."
Kishkindha Kanda,65,16,"""Such as I was, I am presently old and decrepit and I have become slow jumping soldier of misfortune, though my energy in youth was unmatchable and unsurpassable."
Kishkindha Kanda,65,17,"""Now, at this age it is possible for me to go on my own only thereunto... and by that much endeavour that task will be unaccomplished..."" So said Jambavanta to monkeys."
Kishkindha Kanda,65,18,"Then on reverencing the great monkey Jambavanta, the highly intelligent Angada thereafter said these salutary words."
Kishkindha Kanda,65,19,"""I can vault over this ocean which is broadwise in a hundred yojana-breadth, but whether I am capable of coming back or not, it is indefinite..."
Kishkindha Kanda,65,20,"That expert in sentence making, Jambavanta said to the best one among monkeys namely Angada, ""oh, Angada, the best one among monkeys and bears, I know about your capability in traversal..."
Kishkindha Kanda,65,21,"""Why a hundred, if need be you are capable to go up to a hundred thousand yojana-s and come back... but this method of our sending you is uncanonical..."
Kishkindha Kanda,65,22,"""Oh, dear Angada, in anyway lord assigner cannot be an assignee, hence oh, best fly-jumper, all of these people are assignable by you..."
Kishkindha Kanda,65,23,"""You are notionally established as our lord and we have to become your protectionists and, oh, enemy-inflamer Angada, lord becomes the protectionist of army... this alone is the method..."
Kishkindha Kanda,65,24,"""Oh, enemy-subjugator, really you are the linchpin to this mission, thereby oh, dear Angada, you are always to be protected like anything that needs safeguarding..."
Kishkindha Kanda,65,25,""" 'The prime mover of a task is to be safeguarded...' is the byword of the taskmasters, and indeed if only the prime mover is there, all the endowments are achievable that yield fruits..."
Kishkindha Kanda,65,26,"""Thereby, oh, truth-valiant Angada, you are instrumental to this task and as you are privileged with sagacity and audacity, oh, enemy-inflamer, you are the keystone for this task of searching Seetha..."
Kishkindha Kanda,65,27,"""For us you are indeed a respectable one by yourself, and as the son of respected Vali too, and oh, best monkey, sheltered by you we are indeed capable of achieving the objective of our task..."" So said Jambavanta to Angada."
Kishkindha Kanda,65,28,"When that highly scholarly Jambavanta has said thus, the great monkey and the son of Vali Angada said this sentence in reply as an answer."
Kishkindha Kanda,65,29,"""If I am not proceeding to Lanka, nor any other monkey is proceeding, then we have to undertake self-immolation once again, isn't it!"
Kishkindha Kanda,65,30,"""I do not perceive any secure protection for our lives on our going to Kishkindha without fulfilling the bidding of that resolute king of monkeys Sugreeva..."
Kishkindha Kanda,65,31,"""Sugreeva is a lord who shows either forgiveness or furiousness immoderately... and our going to Kishkindha trespassing his bidding is as good as our entering into our own doom..."
Kishkindha Kanda,65,32,"""It will happen in that way only as our going back to Kishkindha results in no other way, thereby it will be apt of you to think deeply, as you can envision the implications..."" Thus Angada said to Jambavanta."
Kishkindha Kanda,65,33,"When that best and valiant fly-jumper Jambavanta is said that way by Angada, then Jambavanta advised him in this best sentence to Angada."
Kishkindha Kanda,65,34,"""Oh, brave Angada, this mission of yours will not be thwarted in the least. I will motivate him who achieves success of this mission of searching Seetha..."
Kishkindha Kanda,65,35,"Then Jambavanta, the outstanding one among monkeys started to motivate the exceptional fly-jumper, and a marvellous one among all the monkeys, and who by now is comfortably sitting abiding a lonely place, namely Hanuma."
Kishkindha Kanda,66,1,"On overseeing the crestfallen monkey-soldiery, which is with many hundreds and thousands of soldiers, then Jambavanta sad this way to Hanuma."
Kishkindha Kanda,66,2,"""Oh, valiant one in the world of vanara-s, being an erudite scholar among all the scriptural scholars, Hanuma, why do not you mumble something, why do you resort to a calmly loneliness..."
Kishkindha Kanda,66,3,"""By your brilliance and brawn, oh, Hanuma, you match up to king of monkeys Sugreeva, or even to Rama and Lakshmana, as well..."
Kishkindha Kanda,66,4,"""The son of Kashyapa Prajapati and Lady Vinata is the best bird among all the birds who is superbly mighty and who is universally renowned as Garuda..."
Kishkindha Kanda,66,5,"""Iindeed, I have oftentimes seen that highly glorious, rapidly speedy, great mighty bird Garuda, pecking up reptiles from ocean..."
Kishkindha Kanda,66,6,"""Whatever is the strength of his wings, that much is the strength of you arms, and even by the yardsticks of his dash and dare, yours too, are unreprovable..."
Kishkindha Kanda,66,7,"""Oh, forthright monkey, you are the finest among all beings by the dint of your force, faculty, flair, and fortitude... why then is your unreadiness in this task of leaping ocean..."
Kishkindha Kanda,66,8,"""Punjikasthala yclept Anjana is the nicest apsara among all apsara-s and she is the wife of Kesari, the monkey..."
Kishkindha Kanda,66,9,"""She who is distinguished for her unparalleled mien in the three worlds, oh, dear boy Hanuma, had to take a rebirth on earth as a monkey who can change her form by her wish, owing to a curse..."
Kishkindha Kanda,66,10,"""She who took birth as the daughter of great souled monkey chief Kunjara, on assuming a human physique, putting on caparisons of amazing garlands, dressed in silken clothing, and shining forth with rarity of her beauty and nubility, at one time ambled on the top of a mountain like a streak of lightning athwart a black-cloud of rainy season. [4-66-10, 11]"
Kishkindha Kanda,66,12,"""When she is strolling on the mountaintop Air-god has slowly lifted up that broad-eyed lady's auspicious and ochry silk apparel with red rouches..."
Kishkindha Kanda,66,13,"""Then the Air-god beheld her well-twinned, thickset, roundish thighs, and even the paired off plumpish breasts, and her beautiful face which is well proportioned in its build..."
Kishkindha Kanda,66,14,"""Just on catching the sight of that gorgeous one, whose pelvic-girdle is fat and ample and who is slender-waisted, and who by all her limbs is pristine, the Air-god is enamoured..."
Kishkindha Kanda,66,15,"""He that Air-god who is ensorcelled by Love-god in all of his limbs, though he is limbless and existing in thin air, embraced that immaculate lady with both of his far-flung arms, as he lost his heart for her..."
Kishkindha Kanda,66,16,"""But she that conscientious lady perplexedly said this sentence in that matter of invisible hugging, 'who wishes to despoil my vow of one-man-one-wife...'"
Kishkindha Kanda,66,17,"""On listening the words of Anjana the Air-god spoke this in reply, 'oh, high-hipped one, I don't dishonour you, hence let there be no fear in your heart, for I am the all-permeating Air-god..."

Kishkindha Kanda,66,20,"""Oh, arcane monkey Hanuma, when Air-god said so to her, oh, ambidextrous one, your mother is gratified, and then, oh, bullish fly-jumpers, your mother very well divined you in a cave..."
Kishkindha Kanda,66,21,"""Thereafter, when you were a boy you have see the just risen sun in the vast of forest, and deeming it to be a just ripen reddish fruit, and thinking it to be a best catch, you hopped up and flew towards sun on the sky..."
Kishkindha Kanda,66,22,"""Even on your flying up three hundred yojana-s, oh, brave monkey, and even when sun's radiation puffed and blown you down, you did not get into any anguish as were indefatigable..."

Kishkindha Kanda,66,27,"""Oh, chivalric warrior at war, while the Air-god is being supplicated, oh, dear boy, Brahma gave you a boon decreeing your 'indestructibility by any missile...'"
Kishkindha Kanda,66,27,"""On scrutinising that you are unhurt even after hit by Thunderbolt, oh, ablest Hanuma, the Thousand-eyed Indra kind-heartedly gave you a choicest boon saying that your death occurs only by your own volition... [4-66-28, 29a]"

Kishkindha Kanda,66,38,"Thereafter, when the best monkey among monkeys, namely Jambavanta, the king of bears has motivated, then that son of Air-god, Hanuma, whose speed is familiar coupled with his irresistible enterprise, enormously increased his physique as though to gladded the army of monkeys."
Kishkindha Kanda,67,1,"On seeing that best monkey Hanuma, who is burgeoning to cross over the hundred yojana-ocean and who is also quickly, progressively, and stupendously maximising his body, the other monkeys instantly shunning off their sadness, raved and rhapsodized over that staggeringly mighty monkey, Hanuma. [4-67-1, 2]"
Kishkindha Kanda,67,3,"Those monkeys available all over there are altogether buoyed up and utterly astounded, and as with the people who have enthusiastically seen Narayana when He maximised His physique to tread the triad of worlds in His Trivikrama incarnation, these monkeys too are looking at Hanuma who is now maximising his body."
Kishkindha Kanda,67,4,"Hanuma who is already an outmatching monkey by way of his energy, has now accrued added energy obtained through the gladness derived by the way of extolment from other monkeys, and then he impetuously lashed his tail and oversized himself."
Kishkindha Kanda,67,5,His physique which is being reinforced with resplendence while all the monkey chiefs are eulogising him has become unsurpassed in its form.
Kishkindha Kanda,67,6,"Hanuma, the lineal son of Air-god, is now prancing about as with a lion prancing around a wide-open den of a mountain."
Kishkindha Kanda,67,7,While he is inflating the face of that clever Hanuma shone forth like a red-hot frying pan and like the fumeless white-hot Ritual-fire.
Kishkindha Kanda,67,8,"On bestirring himself from among the monkeys, and on reverencing the elderly monkeys, Hanuma said this, with a spine-tingling sensation in his body."
Kishkindha Kanda,67,9,"""He who is an inestimable one in his formidableness, and an expeditious one in his meandering in the skies, that Air-god who is the friend of Fire-god will be toppling mountaintops......"

Kishkindha Kanda,67,27,"""I who am a coequal of Air-god in speediness, and of Garuda in fleetness, can traverse ten-thousand yojana-s at a stretch... that is my certitude..."
Kishkindha Kanda,67,28,"""I will fetch that Elixir from the hands of Self-created Brahma, or from hands of Indra even if he is wielding his Thunderbolt just on fleetly triumphing over him... or, I can even bring isle of Lanka itself extracting it from the ocean... thus is my confidence..."" So said Hanuma to other monkeys."
Kishkindha Kanda,67,27,"While that choicest vanara with illimitable resplendence, namely Hanuma, is roaring out his capabilities in the matter of leaping ocean on enormously increasing his physique, all the other monkeys are stunned to stare overhead at his aggrandized form and thus they are extremely gladdened.. [4-67-29b]"
Kishkindha Kanda,67,28,"On hearing the avouchment of Hanuma, which itself is an annihilator of the anguish of his kinsmen, then the king of fly-jumpers Jambavanta is very much gladdened and said. [4-67-29b, 30a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,67,29,"""Oh, brave one, oh, son of Kesari, oh, son of Air-god, oh, dear boy, you have wiped out the boundless bother of your kinsmen in its entirety... [4-67-30b, 31a]"

Kishkindha Kanda,67,33,"Then that tigerly monkey Hanuma said to the forest dwelling monkeys, ""Even so, in this world whosoever he might be, either animate or inanimate being, he cannot possibly bear the brunt of my bouncing... [4-67-34b, 35a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,67,34,"""This Mt. Mahendra is beaming forth with boulders and altitudinal cliffs, and the crests of this mountain are indeed tough, and even towering... [4-67-35b, 36a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,67,35,"""Diversely outspreaded are its trees, and divers are its transuding ores, thus this mountain is shining forth... hence, from the peaks of this Mt. Mahendra I will gain speed for my kick-start... [4-67-36b, 37a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,67,36,"""On the verge of my upstart from here for a hundred yojana-s, these sturdy crags are sure to withstand the impetus of that kick-start... [4-67-37b, 38a]"
Kishkindha Kanda,67,37,"Then that monkey who is the son of Air-god and a selfsame of Air-god shinned up that towering mountain Mahendra, as he is an enemy-subjugator about to subjugate the arch rival Ravana, where that mountain is hedged in with diverse flowers, its pastures are the sweethearts of deer, it is constrictive with diverse flowers of ever flowering, ever fruiting trees and with the flowers of climbers as well, and where lions and tigers are freely moving and ruttish elephants love it, and where the flights of birds are uproarious, and pent-up rapids are clangourous.

Kishkindha Kanda,67,42,"He who is equal in valour to the Paradisiacal Mahendra, that highly energetic and grand monkey Hanuma ambled on loftiest and towery crags of such a mountain."
Kishkindha Kanda,67,43,"When squeezed by both the arms and hands of that high souled Hanuma, that lofty mountain trumpeted, as if it is a lion-paw-hit brutish-elephantine-elephant."
Kishkindha Kanda,67,44,"Virtually and widely bestrewn are the heaps of boulders, essentially scared are all the animals and elephants, and actually rocked are the gigantic trees, and its rapids and waterfalls have spouted out of that mountain by the impact of foot-stepping of Hanuma."
Kishkindha Kanda,67,41,"Then, the numerous gandharva couples and the hoards of vidhyaadhara-s even, that are indulged in drinking and inebriated on that mountain are forsaking those lofty cliffs of that mountain, and even the birds are put to flight, spanking snakes are completely slouching, and rising up and falling down are the stones of that mountaintops to each step of Hanuma, and thus that colossal mountain is desolated. [4-67-45, 46]"
Kishkindha Kanda,67,47,With snakes popping up halfway through their snake-pits with their hoods swaying and tongues hissing that earth-borne mountain Mahendra appeared to be a gleaming mountain with flying flags.
Kishkindha Kanda,67,48,"While the sages are forsaking that towering mountain as their own scare bewildering them, that mountain appeared to be one who is desolated by his associates in the vast of a thick of forest, as a wilting wayfarer."
Kishkindha Kanda,67,49,"And he who is an importantly brave monkey among all the monkeys, an eliminator of enemy stalwarts, that highly proficient, expeditious, and conscientious Hanuma, on stabilising his impulses and making soul is quite staid in speediness, he made head away to Lanka, instinctually."
Kishkindha Kanda,67,45,"Thus, this is the 66th, and conclusive chapter of Kishkindha Kanda of Valmiki Ramayana, the First Epic poem of India."
Sundara Kanda,1,1,"After that, Hanuma, the destroyer of foes, desired to travel in the sky where celestials like chaaranas tread, to search for Seetha, who was taken away by Ravana."
Sundara Kanda,1,2,"Hanuma who desired to perform a deed done by no one else, shone like a bull without any obstacles, with his stretched neck and raised head."
Sundara Kanda,1,3,"After that, the mighty and courageous Hanuma roamed at ease on the lawns with the hue of an emerald, which looked like still water from a distance."
Sundara Kanda,1,4,"The thoughtful Hanuma tread like a rampant lion, making birds fear, uprooting trees by his breast and also killing many animals."
Sundara Kanda,1,5,"That great monkey Hanuma shone like an elephant in a lake, standing on the foot of that great mountain by the name of Mahendra, where many elephants of good breed resided, which was beautifully decorated with many naturally formed mineral rocks of varied hue like black, white, red, blue, yellow and green and which was surrounded by godly serpents and Yakshas, Kinnaras, Gandharvas who were capable of assuming desired form, together with their families."
Sundara Kanda,1,6,"He saluted with joined palms to the Sun-God, Lord Indra, God of Wind, Lord Brahma and Bhutas and decided to leave."
Sundara Kanda,1,7,"Hanuma turned towards east, saluted his father, the Lord of Wind and increased his body to go towards southern direction."
Sundara Kanda,1,8,"With all the Vaanaras seeing, Hanuma decided to fly and like an ocean swelling on full moon days, grew for Rama's success."
Sundara Kanda,1,9,"With a desire to cross the ocean, Hanuma grew his body immeasurably and pressed the mountain with his feet and hands."
Sundara Kanda,1,10,"Thus tormented by Hanuma, that mountain shook for an instant and showered all flowers of trees on it."
Sundara Kanda,1,11,"Covered all through by those fragrant flowers which fell down from the trees, that mountain shone like a mountain made of flowers."
Sundara Kanda,1,12,"That mountain shed water like an elephant in rut emitting rut juice, after being pressed by the mighty Hanuma."
Sundara Kanda,1,13,"Pressed by that mighty Hanuma, streaks of gold silver and antimony color appeared on the Mahendra mountain."
Sundara Kanda,1,14,"Huge Rocks of Sulfur were also shot forth from that mountain, just as a fire burning with a medium flame would emit columns of smoke."
Sundara Kanda,1,15,"Being pressed on all sides by the mountain which itself was being pressed by Hanuma, creatures living in the caves of that mountain shrieked in horrifying tones."
Sundara Kanda,1,16,"That loud noise from creatures which emanated because of stress caused to the mountain, filled the earth and all four directions and forests near that mountain."
Sundara Kanda,1,17,"Great snakes with clear swastika signs on their hoods, spewed out frightening flames with their great heads and bit the rocks with their teeth."
Sundara Kanda,1,18,"Then those great rocks bit by those snakes with anger and venom, burned due to the flame and split into thousand pieces."
Sundara Kanda,1,19,"Medicinal herbs from that mountain, although capable of destroying ordinary poisons, could not neutralize the poison from those snakes."
Sundara Kanda,1,20,"Ascetics residing on that mountain flew away from there thinking that some demons were destroying it. Vidhyadharas who lived there, became afraid and flew away with their women folk, leaving behind them golden jugs of wine in the liquor house, gold vases, a varieties of sauces that can be licked, eatables, various meats, skins of oxen and swords with golden hilts."
Sundara Kanda,1,21,"The intoxicated Vidyadharas with garlands around their neck decked with red flower garlands and smeared with sandal paste, with reddened eyes, and with lotus shaped eyes, obtained the sky."
Sundara Kanda,1,22,"Vidyadhara women wearing necklaces, anklets, armlets and bangles stood in the sky with surprise and with smiles along with their loved ones."
Sundara Kanda,1,23,"Vidyadharas and great sages stood in the sky in a group, showing their great prowess and viewed the mountain."
Sundara Kanda,1,24,"Then they heard words of Charanas, Siddhas and pure hearted Rishis who were located in that clear sky."
Sundara Kanda,1,25,"""This Hanuma, who is equal to a mountain, who is the son of Vayu, and who has great speed, wants to cross the ocean which is abode to crocodiles."""
Sundara Kanda,1,26,"""Hanuma has decided to perform an impossible task for the sake of Rama and Vanaras and wants to obtain the other side of ocean which is hard to obtain."""
Sundara Kanda,1,27,"Vidyadharas thus listened to the words of those great people and looked at the incomparable Hanuma, best among Vanaras, standing on the mountain."
Sundara Kanda,1,28,"He, who is equal to a mountain, shook his hair, quivered his body and let out a great roar like from a vast cloud."
Sundara Kanda,1,29,"About to fly, Hanuma jolted his tail, which was rolled into a circle from top to bottom, and which was covered with hair, just as Garuda, the king of birds would jolt a snake."
Sundara Kanda,1,30,"Receiving his vigor, the tail curled at his back was seen like a great serpent being stolen by Garuda."
Sundara Kanda,1,31,"Hanuma firmly supported his arms (on the mountain surface) which resembled huge iron clubs, crouched the waist and contracted his feet."
Sundara Kanda,1,32,"Bending shoulders and neck, that mighty and glorious Hanuma, increased his energy, strength and courage."
Sundara Kanda,1,33,"With his eyes raised up, seeing the way from a distance, viewing the sky, he held his breath in his heart."
Sundara Kanda,1,34,"That mighty Hanuma, equal to an elephant among monkeys and the best among Vaanaraas, stood firmly with his legs, bent his ears and before flying spoke these words to the Vaanaraas."
Sundara Kanda,1,35,"""I will go to the city of Lanka, ruled by Ravana just like an arrow released by Rama will go, with wind-like speed. If I do not see the daughter of Janaka there, I will go with the same speed to the abode of gods. If I do not see Seetha there in heaven, I will get Ravana the king of raakshasaas tied up in chains without any effort. I will, in all events, return successfully along with Seetha or I will get Lanka along with Ravana after uprooting it."""
Sundara Kanda,1,36,"The best among Vaanaraas, Hanuma, spoke in this way to Vaanaraas and then without thinking about anything else, flew up with lot of vigor. That great monkey also thought himself equal to Garuda, the king of birds."
Sundara Kanda,1,37,"While he was flying up, due to that force, all trees on that mountain flew away in all directions, drawing together all their branches."
Sundara Kanda,1,38,"While flying in the sky, he took along with him, because of the force of his thighs, trees shining with flowers and with fattened lapwing birds."
Sundara Kanda,1,39,"The trees thus being held aloft by the speed of Hanuma's thighs, followed him for a while just as relatives would follow their loved ones embarking on a long journey."
Sundara Kanda,1,40,"Uprooted by the force of Hanuma's thighs, Sal and other excellent trees followed Hanuma like soldiers following their king."
Sundara Kanda,1,41,"Hanuma the great monkey presented a wonderful sight, with his mountain-like appearance together with the well flowered trees."
Sundara Kanda,1,42,"After that, powerful trees sank into the salt ocean like mountains sinking into ocean due to fear of Mahendra."
Sundara Kanda,1,43,"That Hanuma who was equal to a cloud, covered with flowers of various kinds, shoots and buds, shone like a mountain with fireflies."
Sundara Kanda,1,44,"Those trees which were released by Hanuma's speed, dropped flowers and fell down in the water like friends going back after bidding farewell to their dear one."
Sundara Kanda,1,45,"Set in motion by the wind from the movement of Hanuma, that variety of blossom, with various hues, from the trees fell down into the sea. That great ocean shone like the sky filled with stars."
Sundara Kanda,1,46,"Hanuma shone like a cloud in the sky decorated by lightening, with flowers of various hues sticking to his body."
Sundara Kanda,1,47,"That sea water looked like the sky with delightful stars rising up, with flowers flown up by Hanuma's speed."
Sundara Kanda,1,48,"That sky-borne Hanuma's arms which were spread out, were seen like five-headed serpents coming out of a mountain's peak."
Sundara Kanda,1,49,That great monkey shone like one who is drinking the great sea together with its waves. He also seemed like one who desires to drink the whole of sky.
Sundara Kanda,1,50,"The eyes of that Hanuma, who was following the path of sky, which had a brilliance equal to that of lightening, were shining like two fires on a mountain."
Sundara Kanda,1,51,"The round, wide, reddish brown eyes of Hanuma, the best among the monkeys shone like fully risen sun and moon."
Sundara Kanda,1,52,"The ruddy face of Hanuma, with His reddish face shone like the Sun touched by twilight."
Sundara Kanda,1,53,"The tail of Hanuma, the son of Vayu floating in the sky, being risen up looked like the pillar erected in honour of Indra."
Sundara Kanda,1,54,"The great intellectual Hanuma, with his great body, and with white teeth, shone like the Sun, being surrounded by his circular tail."
Sundara Kanda,1,55,"That great monkey Hanuma, with his red colored buttocks, shone like a mountain with a large deposit of red Gairika herb broken into pieces."
Sundara Kanda,1,56,Air passing through the lion among monkeys Hanuma's arm pits sounded like a thundering cloud.
Sundara Kanda,1,57,"The best among monkeys Hanuma flying thus in the sky, looked like a meteor darting away with great speed in the sky from northern direction."
Sundara Kanda,1,58,"With a fast pace equaling that of Sun god, the tall Hanuma shone like an elephant which increases its size when being festered by a rope."
Sundara Kanda,1,59,"Then Hanuma who was flying above the ocean with his body above the ocean and his shadow being immersed in the sea below, looked like a boat being driven by wind."
Sundara Kanda,1,60,"Whatever place Hanuma went towards on the ocean, that place became agitated due to the force of thighs."
Sundara Kanda,1,61,That great monkey with great speed flew in the sky striking with his chest series of waves which had a great body like that of mountains.
Sundara Kanda,1,62,Wind from the mighty Hanuma and the wind released from the clouds caused the ocean with a fearful sound to shake a lot.
Sundara Kanda,1,63,Hanuma flew in the sky dragging along with him big waves from the ocean as though he were sprinkling them in the sky.
Sundara Kanda,1,64,"Hanuma with great speed crossed waves which were equal to Mount Meru and Mount Mandara, that had risen up in the sea, as if counting them."
Sundara Kanda,1,65,"Then the water together with clouds which was driven up by the force of Hanuma, shone like a stretched autumnal cloud in the sky."
Sundara Kanda,1,66,"Then various whales, fishes, turtles and crocodiles were being seen clearly in the sea just as bodies of humans would be seen when clothes are removed."
Sundara Kanda,1,67,"Serpents living in the sea saw Hanuma flying in the sky and thought that it was Garuda, the king of birds."
Sundara Kanda,1,68,Hanuma's shadow which was ten yojanas wide and thirty yojanas long appeared very beautiful on water.
Sundara Kanda,1,69,"That shadow which was following Hanuma and spread on the ocean, shone like a series of dense white clouds."
Sundara Kanda,1,70,"That great monkey Hanuma, the great resplendent one with a huge body, shone like a mountain with wings flying in the sky without any support underneath."
Sundara Kanda,1,71,"In whatever path Hanuma the mighty one went, in that path, there immediately appeared a trough in the ocean below."
Sundara Kanda,1,72,"Hanuma while coursing through the path of birds like the king of birds Garuda, dragged with him series of clouds like the god of wind."
Sundara Kanda,1,73,"Great clouds with white, red, blue and madder colors shone on being dragged by Hanuma."
Sundara Kanda,1,74,"Hanuma who is repeatedly entering and leaving series of clouds as He flies in the sky, is being seen like the moon who shines and is hidden alternately."
Sundara Kanda,1,75,"Then, on seeing Hanuma flying quickly in the sky, Devas, Gandharvas and Danavas showered flowers on him."
Sundara Kanda,1,76,"Then, the Sun did not scorch Hanuma, the best among Vanaras, who was flying for Rama's welfare. The wind god Vayu also served him with a delightful breeze."
Sundara Kanda,1,77,Sages praised the great resplendent Hanuma flying in the sky. Devas and Gandharvas also sang in His praise.
Sundara Kanda,1,78,"Immediately on seeing the best among monkeys, Hanuma, flying without any effort, Nagas, Yakshas, Rakshasas, Devas and birds all praised Him."
Sundara Kanda,1,79,"While that best among vanaras, Hanuma, was flying, the god of ocean thought thus for the respect of Ikshvaaku dynasty:"
Sundara Kanda,1,80,"""If I do not help this best among vanaras Hanuma, I shall become prone to all kinds of ill-talk by those who want to speak against me."""
Sundara Kanda,1,81,"""I was developed by Sagara of Ikshvaaku dynasty. This Hanuma who is helping a descendant of that dynasty should not become tired."""
Sundara Kanda,1,82,"""I have to behave in such a way that Hanuma would take rest. After resting in me for a while, He can cross the remaining distance with comfort."""
Sundara Kanda,1,83,"Samudra thus making a good thought, spoke to Mainaka, the best among mountains with gold in the middle hidden in water."
Sundara Kanda,1,84,"""O best among mountains Mainaka! You have been positioned here by Devendra as an obstacle to the groups of asuras living in paataala."""
Sundara Kanda,1,85,"""You are standing at the entrance of paataala which is difficult to measure, fully covering it, when asuras courageous by birth are trying to rise up again."""
Sundara Kanda,1,86,"""O mountain, you have capability to grow wide, up or down. O best among mountains, for that reason I am encouraging you. Raise up."""
Sundara Kanda,1,87,"""Hanuma, the best among monkeys, the courageous one, who has taken up a fearful task for the benefit of Rama, that such Hanuma while flying in the sky is coming over you."""
Sundara Kanda,1,88,"""To this Hanuma, who is a follower of the Ikshvaaku dynasty, help should be done by me now. Descendants of Ikshvaaku are repectable to me. They are even more respectable to you."""
Sundara Kanda,1,89,"""Do help to us. Our task may not be miscarried. A task which needs to be performed and not done, will increase the anger of good people."""
Sundara Kanda,1,90,"""Raise up above from the water. This Hanuma is the best among fliers and is a guest to be worshipped for us. Let him stand on you."""
Sundara Kanda,1,91,"""O mountain with golden hued middle area and one who is served by Devas and Gandharvas! Hanuma can take rest on you and then traverse rest of the distance."""
Sundara Kanda,1,92,"""You are fit to raise up after seeing the gentleness of Sri Rama, and the exile of Seetha, and the effort of Hanuma."""
Sundara Kanda,1,93,"The mountain with gold in the middle, Mainaka, listening to the words of the salty ocean, got up quickly from the water, together with great trees and creepers."
Sundara Kanda,1,94,"Then that Mainaka became in the risen state, passing through the ocean water, just like the Sun piercing through a cloud with His shining rays."
Sundara Kanda,1,95,"That great Mainaka who was covered by water in all directions, who had peaks with Kinnaras and great serpents, which were equal to a sun rise, which were touching the sky, and which had a golden hue, being ordered by the ocean, showed his peaks in an instant."
Sundara Kanda,1,96,"The sky which had a bluish tinge like that of a sword, shone with a golden hue because of the peaks of the mountain which rose up and which was like molten gold."
Sundara Kanda,1,97,That best among mountains became equal to a hundred suns with its peaks which had a golden hue and which were shining with a self generated shine.
Sundara Kanda,1,98,"Hanuma on seeing the mountain which stood before Him, rising up from the middle of the salty ocean suddenly, decided that it as an obstacle."
Sundara Kanda,1,99,"That great monkey Hanuma with a great speed, brought that great tall mountain with His chest just as the God of wind would a cloud."
Sundara Kanda,1,100,"That best among mountains Mainaka, thus being fell down by that Hanuma, recognized Hanuma's speed and lauded him with pleasure."
Sundara Kanda,1,101,"Mount Mainaka with love and with gladdened heart obtained a human form and standing on its own peak, spoke these words approaching that courageous Hanuma in the sky."
Sundara Kanda,1,102,"""O the great Vanara! You have performed this impossible task of flying over the ocean. Do come down on to my peaks and rest for a while to your comfort."""
Sundara Kanda,1,103,"""The ocean was developed by people born in Sri Rama's dynasty. That such ocean is worshipping in lieu of Sri Rama, you who is desirous of Sri Rama's welfare."""
Sundara Kanda,1,104,"""When a service is done, a return service needs to be rendered. This is an ancient tradition. Such this ocean who wants to do a return service to the Raghu dynasty, is suitable for respect by you."""
Sundara Kanda,1,105,"""""After flying a hundred yojanas, let this Hanuma rest on your peak and then travel the rest of distance."" - Thus I have been encouraged by this ocean for your sake due to His great respect for you. O best among vanaras! Stop for a while and then go after resting on me."""
Sundara Kanda,1,106,"""O best among vanaras! For that reason, here is lots of roots, fruits and other eatables which are fragrant and sweet. May you leave after eating that and resting here for a while."""
Sundara Kanda,1,107,"""O chief among vanaras! Besides this, there also exists a relationship which is famous in all the three worlds, which is based on great virtues, for us with you."""
Sundara Kanda,1,108,"""O son of Vayu, the god of wind! O best among vanaras! I am thinking you as being very important among those vanaras who are fast and who are capable of flying."""
Sundara Kanda,1,109,"""By a person who wants to know dharma or by one who knows dharma, a guest even though ordinary is to be respected. What else can I say in the case of a great guest like you."""
Sundara Kanda,1,110,"""O best among vanaras! You are the son of the great Vayu - the God of wind, who is best in speed among the Devas. In speed you are equal to him alone."""
Sundara Kanda,1,111,"""O knower of Dharma! If you are worshipped, Vayu also gets worship. For that reason you are to be worshipped by me. Also listen to another reason in this matter."""
Sundara Kanda,1,112,"""O son! Earlier in the Krita yuga, mountains had wings. With speed equal to that of Garuda and Vayu, they went in all directions."""
Sundara Kanda,1,113,"""After that when those mountains were thus flying freely, Devas and living creatures together with sages obtained fear in the doubt that those mountains might fall down."""
Sundara Kanda,1,114,"""Then the angry Devendra who performed a hundred Asvamedha rituals, cut off the wings of thousands of mountains by his weapon vajra then and there."""
Sundara Kanda,1,115,"""That Devendra angrily reached me with raised vajra. Then I was thrown away immediately by the great Vayu."""
Sundara Kanda,1,116,"""O best among vanaras! With saved full wings, being thrown down into this salt ocean, I have been protected by your father."""
Sundara Kanda,1,117,"""O chief among vanaras! Vayu is thus indeed respectable to me. For that reason I am respecting you. My this relationship with you has great virtues."""
Sundara Kanda,1,118,"""O great Vanara! Because this matter is like this, you are suitable to make myself and Sagara happy, with a gladdened heart."""
Sundara Kanda,1,119,"""O best among Vanaras! Reduce your fatigue. Accept our worship also. Respect our love. I am happy by your manifestation."""
Sundara Kanda,1,120,"Hanuma listening to the best mountain's words, spoke thus : ""I am happy. Hospitality has been done. Let this ill feeling be removed."""
Sundara Kanda,1,121,"""The time to perform my duty is hastening me. The day too is passing. A promise has also been given by me. I should not stand here in the middle neglecting my duty."""
Sundara Kanda,1,122,"The courageous Hanuma saying thus, touched the mountain with His hand, entered the sky and flew on with a smile."
Sundara Kanda,1,123,"That Hanuma was thus seen with great respect by the ocean and the mountain, and also worshipped with suitable blessings."
Sundara Kanda,1,124,"After that leaving the mountain and the great ocean, and flying up far into the clear sky, Hanuma followed the path of his father."
Sundara Kanda,1,125,"The son of Vayu obtained the speed to fly still higher into the sky and seeing that mountain below, went in the clear sky which had no support."
Sundara Kanda,1,126,"Seeing Hanuma perform that very difficult second task (first one being the flight over ocean), all Devas, Siddhas and great sages praised Him."
Sundara Kanda,1,127,"Devas and the thousand eyed Devendra who were there, became happy by the task of that golden hued Mainaka."
Sundara Kanda,1,128,"The wise Devendra himself spoke these words through faltering tones due to extreme happiness, to Mainaka, the best among mountains."
Sundara Kanda,1,129,"""O Mainaka, the king of mountains! I am very happy with you. O gentle one! I am giving protection to you. Proceed according to your comfort."""
Sundara Kanda,1,130,"To the dauntless Hanuma crossing hundred yojanas, who is fearless even when there is reason to be afraid, a great help has been done by you."
Sundara Kanda,1,131,"This Vanara Hanuma is going for the benefit of Sri Rama, the son of Dasaratha. I am very happy with you who is doing respect to Him."
Sundara Kanda,1,132,"Thereafter, the best among mountains obtained great happiness on seeing Devendra, the lord of Devas being happy."
Sundara Kanda,1,133,Then that mountain with a given boon from Devendra stood still there. Hanuma also leaped over that part of the ocean in an instant.
Sundara Kanda,1,134,"Thereafter, Devas together with Gandharvas, Siddhas and great sages spoke thus to Surasa, the mother of Nagas, equal to the Sun in brilliance."
Sundara Kanda,1,135,"""This glorious son of Vayu, going by the name of Hanuma is flying over the ocean. You obtain a horrible mountain like demonic appearance and make a face with fearful tusks, red-brown eyes and as vast as the sky, and create an obstacle to Him for an instant."""
Sundara Kanda,1,136,"""We are desiring to find out if by His strength and also courage and intelligence He can win over you or obtain sorrow."""
Sundara Kanda,1,137,"That Goddess Surasa, thus spoken to by Devas and also being respected by them, wearing a horrible disfigured appearance of a demon in the middle of the ocean which caused fear to all, and stopping Hanuma who was flying, spoke these words."
Sundara Kanda,1,138,"""O best among Vanaras! You have been given by Devas as my food. I will eat you. Enter inside my mouth."""
Sundara Kanda,1,139,"Thus spoken to by Surasa, the glorious Hanuma, with a happy face and with folded hands, spoke these words to Surasa."
Sundara Kanda,1,140,"""The son of Dasaratha, with the name of Rama entered the forest of Dandaka together with His brother Lakshmana and wife Seetha."""
Sundara Kanda,1,141,"""When that Sri Rama, with a bitter enmity towards Rakshasas, was diverted in another task, His famed wife Seetha had been taken away by Ravana."""
Sundara Kanda,1,142,"""I am going for Rama's sake as a messenger to find Her presence. O subject of Sri Rama! You are suited to help Rama."""
Sundara Kanda,1,143,"""Otherwise after seeing Seetha and informing that to Sri Rama who makes Seetha without troubles, I will obtain your mouth. I am promising truthfully to you."""
Sundara Kanda,1,144,"Thus being spoken to by Hanuma, Surasa with power to take desired form, spoke thus: ""No one can overcome me. This is my boon."""
Sundara Kanda,1,145,"Mother of Nagas, Surasa, desiring to know the strength of Hanuma, spoke these words on seeing Him going away."
Sundara Kanda,1,146,"""O best among Vanaras! You are bound to go only after entering my mouth. This boon had been given to me long ago by Brahma."" - speaking thus, with quickness she opened her wide mouth and stood before Hanuma."
Sundara Kanda,1,147,"Then Hanuma speaking thus to Surasa, became angry and became ten yojanas long and ten yojanas wide."
Sundara Kanda,1,148,"Seeing Hanuma, who looked like a cloud, being ten yojanas long, Surasa also made her mouth twenty yojanas long."
Sundara Kanda,1,149,"Thereafter, Hanuma got angry and became thirty yojanas long. Surasa made her mouth forty yojanas high. The courageous Hanuma then became fifty yojanas high."
Sundara Kanda,1,150,"Thereafter, Hanuma got angry and became thirty yojanas long. Surasa made her mouth forty yojanas high. The courageous Hanuma then became fifty yojanas high."
Sundara Kanda,1,151,"Surasa then made her mouth sixty yojanas long. The mighty Hanuma in the same fashion, became seventy yojanas high."
Sundara Kanda,1,152,Surasa made her mouth eighty yojanas high. The mountain-like Hanuma then became ninety yojanas high.
Sundara Kanda,1,153,"The great wise Hanuma seeing that mouth with a long tongue which was horrible and equal to hell being opened by Surasa, greatly reduced His own body and became the size of a thumb."
Sundara Kanda,1,154,"The glorious Hanuma with great speed, quickly entered Surasa's mouth and came out of it and standing in the sky spoke these words to Surasa."
Sundara Kanda,1,155,"""O daughter of Daksha! I indeed entered your mouth. My regards to you. I will now go where Seetha is. Your boon also came true."""
Sundara Kanda,1,156,"Seeing that Vanara being released from her mouth like the moon from the mouth of Rahu, goddess Surasa spoke these words assuming her normal form."
Sundara Kanda,1,157,"""O gentle Hanuma! Go according to your comfort to achieve the desired task. Bring Seetha together with the great Sri Rama."""
Sundara Kanda,1,158,"Seeing that third very difficult task of Hanuma, all the creatures then praised Hanuma saying ""Good! Good!""."
Sundara Kanda,1,159,"That Hanuma, equal to Garuda in speed, neared the ocean which is the abode of Varuna, entered the sky and went in His original path."
Sundara Kanda,1,160,"Hanuma went, like Garuda, in the sky served by clouds (or streams of water), served also by birds, tread by masters of music Tumbura and other Gandharvas, served by Airavata, borne by lions, elephants, tigers, birds and serpents, decorated by clear Vimanas moving with great speed, shone by fires with thunderous jolt equal to that of Vajra - the weapon of Devendra, decorated by people with good deeds, people with great luck who conquered the heavens, served by the God of fire carrying great quantities of oblations, shone by planets, stars, moon, sun and starlets, occupied by groups of great sages, Gandharvas, Nagas, Yakshas but unpopulated by humans, clear and all pervasive, served by the gandharva king Vishvaavasu, roamed by elephants of Devendra, the path of the moon and the sun, the auspicious one, a wide canopy of the earth constructed by Brahma, served in various ways by excellent courageous groups of Vidyadharas."
Sundara Kanda,1,161,"Hanuma, the son of Vayu, visible everywhere, obtained the sky without support, like the king of birds with long wings."
Sundara Kanda,1,162,"A demoness by the name of Simhika with the power to assume desired form, saw Hanuma flying, increased in size and thought thus in her mind."
Sundara Kanda,1,163,"""After a long time, this great animal came into my grasp. After long time, today I will enjoy my meal."""
Sundara Kanda,1,164,"Thinking thus in her mind, Simhika attracted His shadow. While the shadow was thus being grasped, Hanuma thought thus."
Sundara Kanda,1,165,"""Like a great boat in the ocean with opposing winds, I am being pulled back forcefully, with disabled power."""
Sundara Kanda,1,166,"After that, Hanuma looking sideways, upwards and downwards, saw a big animal raised up in the salty ocean."
Sundara Kanda,1,167,"Hanuma saw that animal with a horrible face and thought: ""This animal with a strange appearance, with great strength attracting shadow, is indeed the animal that had been told by Sugriva. There is no doubt in that."""
Sundara Kanda,1,168,"That wise Hanuma recognizing that animal correctly as Simhika, increased His body greatly, like a cloud in rainy season."
Sundara Kanda,1,169,"That Simhika seeing the growing body of the great monkey Hanuma, spread her mouth to be equal to the middle of Patala."
Sundara Kanda,1,170,"Roaring like a dense cloud, she ran towards the Vanara. Then the wise Hanuma saw her opened very big mouth equal to His own body and also her internal organs."
Sundara Kanda,1,171,"That Hanuma with great strength and with a body equal to a diamond, repeatedly contracted His body and fell into her opened mouth."
Sundara Kanda,1,172,"Siddhas and Charanas saw Hanuma sinking in her mouth, like the full moon on a full moon day being swallowed by Rahu."
Sundara Kanda,1,173,Then Hanuma rend her internal organs with His sharp nails and after that flew up with a speed equal to that of thought.
Sundara Kanda,1,174,"That wise Hanuma felling Simhika down with His vision, courage and ability, developed again by speed."
Sundara Kanda,1,175,"That Simhika with heart rend by Hanuma fell in water with sorrow. Seeing Simhika killed by Hanuma, creatures roaming in the sky spoke thus to that best among Vanaras."
Sundara Kanda,1,176,"""O best among Vanaras! A huge animal has been killed by you. A great task has been done. Perform the task dear to you auspiciously."""
Sundara Kanda,1,177,"""O best among Vanaras! Whoever has the four qualities of courage, vision, intellect and skill, all these four virtues like you, such a person will not fail in any task."""
Sundara Kanda,1,178,"That Hanuma the respectable one, thus respected by them, entered the sky and went like the Garuda with a determined goal."
Sundara Kanda,1,179,"Hanuma after almost reaching the other shore, looked in all directions and saw a series of trees at the end of his journey of hundred yojanas."
Sundara Kanda,1,180,"The best among Vanaras, Hanuma, immediately after getting down also saw an island decorated by a variety of trees and also the forests in the region of Malaya."
Sundara Kanda,1,181,"That Hanuma with controlled senses and with good thoughts looked at the ocean, the bay and the trees born in the bay, and also the faces of the wives of the ocean (rivers are considered wives of ocean), observed Himself to be equal in size to a great cloud as though stopping the sky, and thought thus."
Sundara Kanda,1,182,"""After seeing my huge body and the speed, Rakshasas will become curious."" - thus thought the great Hanuma."
Sundara Kanda,1,183,"For that reason, Hanuma reduced His mountain-like body and obtained the nature of one who reached self-realization, free from infatuations."
Sundara Kanda,1,184,"Hanuma greatly reducing His size became normal in nature regaining His original form, like Vishnu who mitigated the strength of Bali by taking three strides."
Sundara Kanda,1,185,"Hanuma capable of assuming many different beautiful forms, who cannot be defeated by enemies, obtained the other side of ocean and being cognizant of Himself restored His own form and became with a decided mission."
Sundara Kanda,1,186,"After that great one who looked like a huge mass of clouds, alighted on the mountain peak of Lamba with wonderful lower peaks, abundant with various things and filled with Ketaka, Uddalaka and coconut trees."
Sundara Kanda,1,187,"After that Hanuma for His part obtained the ocean shore, observed the city of Lanka from the top of the mountain, leaving His original form, tormenting animals and birds, alighted on that mountain."
Sundara Kanda,1,188,"Having tranersed, by the dint of his strength over the ocean which was infested with demons and reptiles and endowed with series of huge waves, and alighting on the shore of the great sea, Hanuma then saw the City of Lanka having a resemblance of Amaravati, the capital City of Indra."
Sundara Kanda,2,1,That Hanuma with great strength crossed the insurmountable ocean without becoming tired and viewed the city of Lanka located on the peak of Mount Trikuta.
Sundara Kanda,2,2,"After that, the powerful Hanuma standing there shone like one made of flowers being showered by a rain of flowers released by trees."
Sundara Kanda,2,3,"The glorious Hanuma with the best courage, even though crossing a hundred yojanas, was without a sigh and did not obtain any tiredness."
Sundara Kanda,2,4,"""I can cross many hundreds of yojanas. What to say about the end of the ocean which had been counted to be hundred yojanas long?"""
Sundara Kanda,2,5,"That Hanuma, the best among powerful ones and the foremost also among those who can fly, reached the city of Lanka by crossing the great ocean with good speed."
Sundara Kanda,2,6,He passed through forests with dark green hued fragrant lawns and also consisting of great rocks and hills.
Sundara Kanda,2,7,"Hanuma, the best among Vanaras and the radiant one, tread on mountains covered with trees and on series of trees full of flowers."
Sundara Kanda,2,8,That son of God Vayu stood on a mountain and saw forests and gardens and also the city of Lanka situated on the top of a mountain.
Sundara Kanda,2,9,"Standing on that mountain, the elephant among monkeys, Hanuma, saw pine trees, Karnikaras, date-palms in full blossom, Priyalas, lemon trees, wild jasmine trees, mogra trees, long pepper trees filled with sweet fragrance, Kadamba trees and seven leaved banana trees, Asana trees, Kovidaras, Karaviras in full blossom, trees that were tied by the weight of their flowers and flower buds, that were distressed by birds, with their crests moved by wind, wells and various glorious pleasure-groves filled by various trees that give fruits and flowers in all seasons and beautiful gardens also, surrounded by various ponds consisting of swans and ducks."
Sundara Kanda,2,10,"The glorious Hanuma neared the city of Lanka ruled by Ravana, and saw the city which looked like the city of Gods in heaven, decorated by moats filled with lotuses and water-lilies, which was well protected, since the time of Seetha's abduction, by Ravana and by Rakshasas with horrifying voices roaming around, which was surrounded by a golden boundary wall, that beautiful great city consisted of houses equal in height to mountains and which looked like autumnal clouds, with white and elevated main streets, decorated with flags and pennons, with excellent golden hued archways adorned with sculpted rows of vines."
Sundara Kanda,2,11,That best among monkeys Hanuma saw the city of Lanka with beautiful white buildings situated on the top of a mountain like a city located in the sky.
Sundara Kanda,2,12,"Hanuma saw that city of Lanka ruled by Ravana the king of Rakshasas, constructed by Visvakarma (architect of Gods), and which looked as though it were floating in the sky."
Sundara Kanda,2,13,"Hanuma saw the city of Lanka with buttress and enclosure wall as her hip and loins, the vast body pf water in the moat as her raiment, Satagnis and Sulas as her locks, the mansions as her earrings, constructed by thought. He reached the northern gate and thought thus."
Sundara Kanda,2,14,"Hanuma saw the city of Lanka equal to peak of Kailasa as though touching the sky, as though flying to reach the sky, with its best mansions, filled with horrible rakshasas and serpants like the city of Bhogavati (capital of Patala), one which was unfathomable, a well arranged and a clear city governed by Kubera in earlier times, protected by courageous, horrible serpents and Rakshasas with mouths with sharp teeth like a cave, with spikes and Pattisas (spears) in their hands. Hanuma saw that Lanka's great protection and the ocean and Ravana the horrible enemy and thought thus."
Sundara Kanda,2,15,"""Even if Vanaras were to come here they would not meet with success. It is not possible even for Devas to be victorious against Lanka in war""."
Sundara Kanda,2,16,"""Even if He reaches this very difficult and impenetrable Lanka ruled by Ravana, what can that Sri Rama with mighty arms do""?"
Sundara Kanda,2,17,"""In the matter of overcoming rakshasas, there seems to be no opportunity for persuasion, gifts, dissension or even war""."
Sundara Kanda,2,18,"""Only four great Vanaras can come here - the son of Vali (Angada), Nila, myself and the wise king Sugriva""."
Sundara Kanda,2,19,"""I will first find out if Seetha is alive or not. I will think all this later, after seeing that daughter of Janaka""."
Sundara Kanda,2,20,"After that, that elephant among monkeys Hanuma who was interested in the welfare of Sri Rama, stood on that mountain peak and thought for an instant."
Sundara Kanda,2,21,"""It is not possible for me to enter the city of ogres protected by cruel and strong rakshasas, with this appearance""."
Sundara Kanda,2,22,"""All these mighty ogres with extraordinary energy and great prowess are to be cheated by me while engaged in the search of Seetha""."
Sundara Kanda,2,23,"""To achieve this great deed successfully, entering the city of Lanka in a small form at night is a timely thing to do"" ."
Sundara Kanda,2,24,"Hanuma saw such that city of Lanka, which was difficult to overcome even for Devas or asuras, and thought thus repeatedly."
Sundara Kanda,2,25,"""By what idea can I see Seetha the daughter of Janaka, unseen by the wicked Ravana, the king of the ogres."
Sundara Kanda,2,26,"""How can the task of Sri Rama, one who knows self, not be destroyed? How can I alone see Seetha alone in a place devoid of people?."""
Sundara Kanda,2,27,"""With a mediator who has an unsteady and gloomy mind working against time and place, tasks that are otherwise ready to succeed get harmed, like the darkness that gets destroyed at dawn""."
Sundara Kanda,2,28,"""Even a decided mind will not shine when thinking about gain and loss. Mediators who are respected by scholarly people will also harm tasks due to their arrogance."""
Sundara Kanda,2,29,"""How will the task at hand be not harmed? How will my mind not get gloominess? How will not the crossing of ocean go waste?."""
Sundara Kanda,2,30,"""If I were to be seen by rakshasas, this task of Sri Rama, with a famed mind, who desires the slaying of Ravana will become wasteful."""
Sundara Kanda,2,31,"""It is not possible to be in Lanka even in the form of a rakshasa. What to say about being there in any other form?"""
Sundara Kanda,2,32,"""My thought goes thus: Even wind cannot pass here without being known. There is nothing not known to the might rakshasas."""
Sundara Kanda,2,33,"""If I stay here with my usual form, I can be destroyed. The task of the Lord will also be harmed."""
Sundara Kanda,2,34,"""For that reason, I will become small in my appearance and will enter Lanka at night for the success of the task of Sri Rama."""
Sundara Kanda,2,35,"""Entering the unapproachable city of Lanka at night and searching all the mansion of Ravana, I can see Seetha."""
Sundara Kanda,2,36,"The courageous Hanuma thus thinking and being interested in discovering Seetha, then desired the sun to set."
Sundara Kanda,2,37,"After the sun had set, Hanuma reduced His body at night with a size equal to that of a cat and became a wonderful sight to behold."
Sundara Kanda,2,38,The courageous Hanuma quickly flew during evening time and entered the beautiful city with well divided main pathways.
Sundara Kanda,2,39,"Hanuma saw that great city filled with series of mansions, golden hued pillars and window lattices, which was equal to the city of Gandharvas, consisting of seven and eight storied buildings with their top portions studded with crystals and pearls and decorated with gold."
Sundara Kanda,2,40,"There in that city of Lanka, the houses of rakshasas shone with top portions painted by cats-eyes and emeralds and decorated by groups of pearls."
Sundara Kanda,2,41,Golden archways with strange hues illuminated the well decorated city of Lanka in all directions.
Sundara Kanda,2,42,Hanuma on seeing the unimaginable city of Lanka with a wonderful appearance became sad thinking about the prospect of capturing Lanka and also happy being eager to see Seetha.
Sundara Kanda,2,43,"Hanuma saw that city of Lanka of great fame, with white, closely built buildings having golden windows and doorways of great value, consisting of ogres of great strength and ruled by the hands of Ravana."
Sundara Kanda,2,44,"The shining moon too rose up with its many thousands of rays, as though performing help to Hanuma, being at the middle of its retinue of stars and covering the earth with a canopy of light. That Hanuma saw the moon rising up with a glow of a conch shell, shining with a milky white hue of a lotus-fiber, like a swan swimming in a lake."
Sundara Kanda,2,45,"That Hanuma saw the moon, who was rising up in the sky with the splendour of a couch-shell, shining in white colour as milk or lotus-fibre, and looking like a swan swimming in a lake."
Sundara Kanda,3,1,"That Hanuma, best among monkeys, the intellectual son of Vayu, one with great might, stood on the moutain called Lamba with its high peaks equalling a high cloud, gathered courage and entered at night the city of Lanka ruled by Ravana and filled with beautiful forests and places of water such as lakes."
Sundara Kanda,3,2,"The city of Lanka was shone by buildings equalling autumnal clouds. With a sound resembling that of an ocean, it was served by ocean breeze. It was filled with well fed and mighty armies like Vitapati, the capital of Kubera. It had elephants positioned at archways and had white gates and archways."
Sundara Kanda,3,3,"Quickly approaching that city of Lanka which was protected by Rakshasas, like the the auspicious city of Bhogavati being protected by serpents moving about, spread with cloud illumined by flashes of lightening, served by pathways of stars, witha light breeze like the Indra's city of Amaravati, surrounded by a wall with a golden hue, decorated by flags with sounds from groups of small bells. He became happy and leapt up the wall."
Sundara Kanda,3,4,"Seeing the city everywhere Hanuma became surprised at heart. Thereafter Hanuma the monkey, became happy seeing the doors which were of golden color, with platforms of cat's eye gems, inlaid with diamonds, crystals and pearls, embellished with floors of gems, graced with elephants made of refined gold, crowned with spotless white silver, stairs studded with cat's eye gems, with inside walls made of crystal free from dust, provided with lovely assembly halls, with sounds of Krauncha birds and peacocks, served by royal swans, looking as though flying toward the sky, with auspicious houses resounding everywhere with the sounds of clarionets and ornaments, equalling the city of Vasvaukasaara, as though flying towards the sky."
Sundara Kanda,3,5,"Seeing that city of Ravana, which was best among cities, a wealthy city, a beautiful and auspicious city, that powerful Hanuma thought thus."
Sundara Kanda,3,6,"""It is not possible for anyone else to oppose this city, by strength alone, which is being guarded by armies of Ravana with raised weapons."""
Sundara Kanda,3,7,"This land may be conquerable by Kumuda or Angada, to the great monkey Sushena or to Mainda or Dvivida."
Sundara Kanda,3,8,"There may be access to this land to the son of Sun God Sugreeva, to the monkey Kusaparvana, to the chief among monkeys Riksha and to me."
Sundara Kanda,3,9,"Considering the long armed Sri Rama's strength and Lakshmana's valour, Hanuma became happy."
Sundara Kanda,3,10,"That great monkey saw that city of king of rakshasas like a wealthy woman decorated with diamonds for her clothes, with various storage houses as earrings, with amouries for her breasts. Due to the lamps that illuminated the radiant great houses, all darkness was lost."
Sundara Kanda,3,11,"Thereafter, the guardian of that city, in her own form, saw Hanuma, the best among monkeys and the mighty one, entering."
Sundara Kanda,3,12,"Seeing that best among monkeys Hanuma there, that Lanka ruled by Ravana, rose up herself with a horrific appearance of face an eyes."
Sundara Kanda,3,13,She stood in front of the best among Vanaras Hanuma. She made a great sound and spoke to Hanuma thus.
Sundara Kanda,3,14,"""O one who lives in gardens! Who are you? For what reason did you come here? As long as your lives are sustained, tell me the truth here before that."""
Sundara Kanda,3,15,"""O Vanara! It is indeed not possible for you to enter this city of Lanka which is protected by Ravana's forces and strongly guarded all around."""
Sundara Kanda,3,16,"Therafter the mighty Hanuma spoke to Lanka standing in front of Him as follows : ""Whatever matter you are asking me, I will tell you that truthfully."""
Sundara Kanda,3,17,"""You are standing at the entrance to the city. O one with ugly eyes! Who are you? O horrible one! Stopping me, for what reason are you threatening me?"""
Sundara Kanda,3,18,"Listening to Hanuma's words, that Lanka, with ability to achieve desired form, became angry and spoke these strong words to Hanuma."
Sundara Kanda,3,19,"""I protect this city, being invincible. I wait for the orders of the king of demons Ravana, the great one."""
Sundara Kanda,3,20,"""After humilliating me it is not possible for you to enter the city. Being beaten by me, you will leave life and have a permanent sleep."""
Sundara Kanda,3,21,"""O Vanara! I am protecting this city of Lanka in all directions. This matter has been already told to you by me."""
Sundara Kanda,3,22,"The son of Vayu and best among Vanaras heard Lanka's words and stood up like a second mountain, with a purpose."
Sundara Kanda,3,23,"Thereafter that Hanuma the wise one, with great strength, best among those who can fly and best among Vanaras, saw that city of Lanka in the form of an ugly woman and spoke thus."
Sundara Kanda,3,24,"""I should like to see the city of Lanka with its palaces, defensive walls and archways. I came here for that reason. I am very curious to see them."""
Sundara Kanda,3,25,"""My arrival here is indeed to see Lanka's gardens, parks, forests and important houses all over."""
Sundara Kanda,3,26,"Listening to Hanuma's words, Lanka with the ability to assume desired form, spoke harsh words stronger than before."
Sundara Kanda,3,27,"""O lowly Vanara with an evil mind! It is not possile for you to see this city ruled by king of rakshasas, without first defeating me."""
Sundara Kanda,3,28,"Then that tiger among Vanaras Hanuma spoke to that demon : ""O auspicious one! After seeing this city I will return back again to where I came from."""
Sundara Kanda,3,29,"Thereafter that Lanka made a great sound causing terror and hit Hanuma, the best among Vanaras, with her palm quickly."
Sundara Kanda,3,30,"Then that tiger among Vanaras, the powerful son of Vayu, being hit powerfully by Lanka made a great sound."
Sundara Kanda,3,31,"Thereafter that Hanuma became dizzy with anger and folded his fingers of left hand. He then hit her with His fist. ""She is a woman"" - thinking thus He did not show much anger by Himself."
Sundara Kanda,3,32,That demon fell on land immediately by that hit with a distressed body and appeared with a horrific face.
Sundara Kanda,3,33,"Thereafter the intellectual and glorious Hanuma saw her fallen down and thinking her to be woman, showed kindness."
Sundara Kanda,3,34,Thereafter that Lanka being very gloomy spoke with a falterting tone without pride these words to Hanuma the Vanara.
Sundara Kanda,3,35,"""O long armed one! O best among Vanaras! Get propitiated and protect me. O gentle one! Those with great strength and courage always stand firm on tradition."""
Sundara Kanda,3,36,"""O Vanara! I am myself the city of Lanka. O strong one! O courageous one! I am defeated by your strength."""
Sundara Kanda,3,37,"""O lord of Vanaras! In earlier times I had been given a boon by Lord Brahma. Hear from me about this matter."""
Sundara Kanda,3,38,"""Let this be known by you - whenever a Vanara conquers you with his might, then a fear will come for Rakshasas."""
Sundara Kanda,3,39,"""O gentle one! With your appearance now, that time has come for me. Ordinance of Brahma is the truth and is immutable."""
Sundara Kanda,3,40,"""The destruction has come for Ravana the evil minded king and to all Rakshasas due to Seetha."""
Sundara Kanda,3,41,"""O best aming Vanaras! For that reason, enter the city of Lanka ruled by Ravana and do here whatever tasks you want to."""
Sundara Kanda,3,42,"""O lord of Vanaras! Enter the auspicious city of Lanka stuck by the curse, ruled by the king of Rakshasas, roam everywhere and search for the chaste wife Seetha according to your comfort."""
Sundara Kanda,4,1,"That Hanuma the best among Vanaras, the great radiant one, the long armed one, conquered with His might the best Lanka who is capable of assuming desired form. He then leapt over the city wall at a place that was not a gate."
Sundara Kanda,4,2,"Desiring the benefit of the king of Vanaras Sugreeva, that Hanuma entered the city of Lanka and thus actually placed His left foot on the enemies' heads."
Sundara Kanda,4,3,"That son of Vayu endowed with great strength, entered the city at night and took the grand road shone by flowers and pearls. After that Hanuma went towards that beautiful city of Lanka."
Sundara Kanda,4,4,"The beautiful city shone like the sky together with clouds, with its cloud like houses filled with sounds of laughter and with sounds of musical instruments at the interior, equal in strength to diamonds and clubs and with windows decorated with diamonds."
Sundara Kanda,4,5,"Then that city of Lanka shone brilliantly being well decorated by the houses of Rakshasas. These were modern houses which equalled white clouds, which were surprising with the shape of lotus and swastika and which were auspicious."
Sundara Kanda,4,6,"That glorious Hanuma, performer of beneficial deeds for Sugreeva the king of monkeys, moved around the city of Lanka which had wonderful garlands and jewellery, for the sake of Sri Rama. He saw the city and became happy too."
Sundara Kanda,4,7,"Going from one building to another, Hanuma saw buildings in various shapes and forms on every side."
Sundara Kanda,4,8,"Hanuma heard a sweet song which was decorated by sound from the three svaras - Mandra, Madhya and Tara of love lorne women like Apsara women in heaven."
Sundara Kanda,4,9,"Hanuma also heard there and there sound from the tinkling of ornaments worn around the waist in the houses of wealthy people, sounds of footfall over stair, sound from clapping of arms by warriors and roar of ogres."
Sundara Kanda,4,10,"Hanuma also heard there and there sound from the tinkling of ornaments worn around the waist in the houses of wealthy people, sounds of footfall over stair, sound from clapping of arms by warriors and roar of ogres."
Sundara Kanda,4,11,There Hanuma heard ritual chantings muttered by rakshasas in their houses. He saw ogres engaged in study of Vedas. He also saw roaring rakshasas who came together to praise Ravana.
Sundara Kanda,4,12,He saw many spies of Ravana and a big army of ogres which stood surrounding the royal highway in the central zone of city.
Sundara Kanda,4,13,"Hanuma saw those who were initiated into various Vedic practices, those who wore matted locks on their head, those who had shaven heads, those who wore cow hides and other clothing, those who were carrying Kusa grass as weapons and also those who had fire vessels as weapons, those who carried hammers and clubs in their hands and also those who had worn staffs as weapons, hose who were one-eyed, those who had one ear, hose who were pot-bellied and with hanging breast, those who had horrible appearances, those with twisted mouths, those who were horrific and also short people, those who carried bows and arrows those who carried swords, those who carried pestles and clubs as weapons, those who carried excellent Parighas in their hands, those who shone with strange armour, those who were not very fat, those who were not too thin, those who were neither tall nor short, those who were not very fair, those who were not very dark, those who were not very hunchbacked, those who were not very short, those who had great brilliance, those who carried banners, those who carried flags and those who carried different weapons."
Sundara Kanda,4,14,"Hanuma saw many people, who had great might, who carried javelins and trees as weapons, those who carried Pattisas and thunderbolts, those who carried in their hands sling and nooses, those who carried flowered garlands, wearing sandal paste and decorated with best jewellery, those who had various kinds of appearances roaming freely at will, those who carried sharp spikes and thunderbolts."
Sundara Kanda,4,15,"Hanuma saw at the front of inner city, a hundred thousand central protective force which was attentive and was positioned there at the command of Ravana."
Sundara Kanda,4,16,That Hanuma saw Ravana's house with a golden doorway. That famed house was on the top of a mountain. Motes filled with white lotuses surrounded it. It was also surrounded by a compound wall. He watched the house again and again.
Sundara Kanda,4,17,"The great Hanuma entered secretly Ravana's inner city which was equal to paradise, rendered noisy by neighing of horses and tinkling of ornaments, by chariots, vehicles and aerial-cars and decorated by auspicious elephants and horses and great elephants with four tusks and by birds and animals in heat. It had beautiful entrances and was protected by thousands of rakshasas with great strength."
Sundara Kanda,4,18,"Hanuma entered the inner city of Ravana which was filled with gold, which had a golden court-yard , with a central area decorated by pearls and diamonds of great value and sprinkled daily with water containing superb algallocum and sandal-wood."
Sundara Kanda,4,19,"Thus, this is the 4th chapter in Sundara Kanda of Valmiki Ramayana, the First Epic poem of India."
Sundara Kanda,5,1,"Thereafter that intellectual Hanuma saw the moon in the sky shining with rays, obtaining the middle portion of sky. Spreading a great quantity of moon shine, moon looked like a bull in heat among cows."
Sundara Kanda,5,2,"After that Hanuma saw the moon coming up destroying the sins of the world, causing the great ocean to grow and causing all living beings to shine."
Sundara Kanda,5,3,"What ever splendour shines over Mount Mandara on earth, on the ocean during evenings, over the lotuses in the waters, the same splendour shone on the beautiful moon."
Sundara Kanda,5,4,"Like a swan in a silver cage, like a lion in the cave of Mount Mandara, like a warrior on a proud elephant, in the same way the moon shone in the sky."
Sundara Kanda,5,5,"The full moon with its horn like spot shone like a sharp horned standing ox with a high hump, like a great white mountain with tall summits, like an elephant with golden tusks."
Sundara Kanda,5,6,"The Divine moon who lost the stain of cold water and frost, with lost stain due to eclipse by the great planet sun, one who has a calm spot which is an abode of brilliant splendour, with a symbol of hare, shone brilliantly."
Sundara Kanda,5,7,"In whatever way a lion obtaining a level surfaced rock (shines), in whatever way best elephant obtaining a great battle(shines), in whatever way a king obtaining kingdom(shines), in the same way the clear moon shone."
Sundara Kanda,5,8,"The Divine evening with lost stain due to rise of shining moon, with the stain due to meal of flesh eating rakshasas, and in which the bitterness of mind of young women and their lovers is wiped away, became with a heavenly glow."
Sundara Kanda,5,9,Musical notes from stringed instruments which were comforting to ears started. Women with good character were sleeping with husbands and also rakshasas with extremely strange character started to roam.
Sundara Kanda,5,10,"That Hanuma the courageous one, the intellectual one, saw houses with people in heat, houses filled with people, full chariots, horses, elephants and best furniture and also full of wealth."
Sundara Kanda,5,11,"Hanuma saw rakshasas railing a lot at one another moving their heavy shoulders, throwing wild and incoherent words a lot, insulting one another being intoxicated."
Sundara Kanda,5,12,"(Hanuma saw) rakshasas who smote breast, those who threw limbs on women, those who were spreading their strange forms sporting their strong bows."
Sundara Kanda,5,13,"Hanuma saw some women applying sandal paste on their bodies and also some other women sleeping there, in the same way some women with good appearance were smiling, and some other women were sighing in anger."
Sundara Kanda,5,14,"Hanuma saw (the city of Lanka that) shone with great elephants making sound and also with gentlemen well respected, shone with warriors in a wresting bout, with long sighs, like serpents in a lake hissing."
Sundara Kanda,5,15,"Hanuma saw Yatudhanaas who were intellectuals, who were good talkers, who had good devotion, important people to the world, who had various ways, and people who had beautiful names in that city."
Sundara Kanda,5,16,"That Hanuma seeing people with good appearance, who had various good virtues, those who were according to their character, those who were radiant, all those - became happy. Then that Hanuma saw those who had horrific appearance, those who were according to their appearance - some of those too."
Sundara Kanda,5,17,"Hanuma saw thereafter there, their women - those who were eligible for distinction, those who were of great skill with an interested heart in lovers and in drinks and those who were like stars with good effect."
Sundara Kanda,5,18,"Hanuma saw some women who were brilliant with radiance, adorned a lot with bashfulness, those who were hugged by lovers in the middle of night, those who were hugged with great pleasure, those who were hugged by flowers like birds."
Sundara Kanda,5,19,"The intellectual Hanuma saw some other women there comfortably sitting on the laps of their lovers, at the top of their buildings, dear to their husbands and (some other women) interested in virtuous deeds, and some possessed by the lord of love."
Sundara Kanda,5,20,"Hanuma saw women with golden complexion lacking clothes, women with a complexion of refined gold suitable for mating and some other women also with the colour of moon and some other women with beautiful bodies lacking a lover."
Sundara Kanda,5,21,"Thereafter that Vanara warrior saw those with great happiness, those who obtained lovers who entertained, those who attracted like flowers, those with great beauty and women in their houses filled with happiness."
Sundara Kanda,5,22,"Hanuma saw rows of faces shining like the moon, beautiful rows of eyes with curved eyebrows and rows of ornaments like beautiful rows of lighting."
Sundara Kanda,5,23,"Hanuma did not see Seetha, one with great beauty born in a royal family following a virtuous path, well brought up, like a creeper in full blossom, one who was thin, and one who was born from the mind (of creator)."
Sundara Kanda,5,24,"Hanuma did not see that Seetha who stood in the path of ancient righteousness with Her sight on Sri Rama, who was possessed by the love for Sri Rama, who entered the glorious mind of husband and always the best among women who were the best."
Sundara Kanda,5,25,"Hanuma did not see Seetha, tortured by separation from Sri Rama, with unabounding tears in her throat, in earlier times who had invaluable and best jewellery on her neck, born with beautiful eyebrows, with a sweet voice, like a she- hen who did not dance in a forest because of Her current sorrow."
Sundara Kanda,5,26,"Hanuma did not see Seetha who was like a crescent with a blurred outline, like a streek of gold coated by dust, like an arrow in an injury, like a series of clouds scattered by wind."
Sundara Kanda,5,27,"Hanuma became a numb minded one for sometime, stricken with grief not seeing for a moment Seetha, wife of Sri Rama the best among those who talk, and the lord of all humans."
Sundara Kanda,5,28,"Thus, this is the 5th chapter in Sundara Kanda of Valmiki Ramayana, the First Epic poem of India."
Sundara Kanda,6,1,"That Hanuma who could assume any desire form, searching among houses had a lot of grief. Endowed with great speed, He roamed again the city of Lanka."

Sundara Kanda,6,9,"Well protected by well trained rakshasas, protecting the inner area, filled all over by best women who were important."
Sundara Kanda,6,10,"Having happy women, the abode of Ravana with the tinkling of best jewellery had a sound like that of an ocean."
Sundara Kanda,6,11,"Together with royal insignia, with best scents and sandal wood, spread with great number of people like a great forest with lions."
Sundara Kanda,6,12,"Resounded by bheris and mridagas, resounded by the sound of conch-shells, prayed upon daily by Rakshsas, with rituals on festivals, always worshipped by rakshasas."

Sundara Kanda,7,1,"That Hanuma, the strong one, saw a group of houses with windows in golden hue, embedded with cat's-eye gems, like a great group of clouds in rainy season with lighting, together with a group of birds."
Sundara Kanda,7,2,"Hanuma saw various halls of the houses, important buildings storing conches, bows, and other weapons, and also heartening spacious attics at the top of mountain- like houses."
Sundara Kanda,7,3,"Hanuma saw houses glittered by various riches, well worshipped by Devas and Asuras, devoid of all flaws and obtained by the self-might of rakshasas."
Sundara Kanda,7,4,"Hanuma saw those houses of the ruler of Lanka, constructed by great effort as though constructed by Mayaa himself on earth with all best qualities."
Sundara Kanda,7,5,"Thereafter Hanuma saw the best house of the lord of rakshasas, having the appearance of a cloud, soul-captivating one having a beautiful form made of gold which has no comparison, suitable of Ravana's might"
Sundara Kanda,7,6,"Hanuma saw Ravana's house like heaven thrown upon earth, effulgent with glory, embedded with variety of diamonds covered by flowers of various trees, like the summit of a mountain covered by pollen."
Sundara Kanda,7,7,"Being shone by the best among women like a cloud by lightening, being worshipped, like being carried by the best swans, like an aerial car full of splendor, of good people in sky."
Sundara Kanda,7,8,"Hanuma saw the best house like a beautiful cloud endowed with many hues, like the sky illumined by planets including the moon, decked with numerous precious stones like a mountain peak, looking picturesque with numerous minerals."
Sundara Kanda,7,9,The earth was made to be full of mountain ranges. The mountains were made to be abounded of trees. The trees were made to be full of flowers. The flower was made to be full of filaments and petals.
Sundara Kanda,7,10,White mansions were also built in the same way. Lakes also with beautiful flowers and also lotuses together with filaments and forest that were the best and wonderful.
Sundara Kanda,7,11,"There the great Hanuma saw a great aerial car, the best among best of aerial cars, shining with the name of Pushpaka with the rays of precious stones, and capable of traveling long distances."
Sundara Kanda,7,12,"Artificial birds made of cat's-eye gems, as well as birds made of silver and coral, wonderful serpants made of various jewels, horses of beautiful limbs suitable by their noble breed were arranged."
Sundara Kanda,7,13,"Birds were made with corals on their wings and ogether with golden flowers, with good wings, with curved and bent wings in a playful way, shining like helpers of the god of love himself"
Sundara Kanda,7,14,"Images of elephants in a lotus-pool with filaments of lotus on body, with lotus petals held in their trunks, were devoted to the worship of an image of Goddess Lakshmi. And also an image of Goddess Lakshmi with four graceful hands and holding lotus in Her hand was made to exist in Pushpaka."
Sundara Kanda,7,15,"In this fashion, nearing that house which was shining like a mountain with a beautiful glow that house with great sweet fragrance like a beautiful mountain during spring, with beautiful cave became surprised and saw (again)."
Sundara Kanda,7,16,"Thereafter that Hanuma nearing that city of Lanka worshipped by Rakshasas, ruled by arms of ten-headed Ravana, moving thereabout became very gloomy on not seeing that Seetha well worshipped by all and greatly conquered by the virtues of Her husband Sri Rama"
Sundara Kanda,7,17,"Thereafter then the heart of the great souled Hanuma who contemplated supreme spirit in many ways with a disciplined mind following righteous path, with good observant eyes, moving about in the city of Lanka became greatly sorrowful on not seeing Seetha."
Sundara Kanda,7,18,"Thus, this is the 7th chapter in Sundara Kanda of Valmiki Ramayana, the First Epic poem of India."
Sundara Kanda,8,1,"That Hanuma the courageous one, the son of Lord Vayu, saw the great aerial plane standing in the middle of that building with a surprising hue, due to diamonds, and gems decorated by series of refined gold."
Sundara Kanda,8,2,That plane shone like symbol for solar path standing in the aerial path obtaining the sky. Manufactured by Vishvakarma himself and praised by him as one without comparison in beauty.
Sundara Kanda,8,3,"In that plane there is not even a small thing that is not made with great effort, in that there is nothing without the best diamonds, those characteristics definitely are not in Devas also, in that there is nothing that is not of great significance."
Sundara Kanda,8,4,"One that has been obtained by austerities and by prowess, one that moves about by thoughts of concentrated mind, made from various significant parts with an appearance of parts of equal significance, collected from here and there from all over the world."
Sundara Kanda,8,5,"Obtaining a special construction as a special object, like a mountain with wonderful peaks adorned by many peaks, attractive to soul, calm like an autumnal moon, like the peak of a mountain with other wonderful small peaks."
Sundara Kanda,8,6,"Hanuma saw that aerial plane which rakshasas who were great eaters, with a face beautified by earnings, who roamed around in the sky and thousands of genii with round eyes, crooked eyes and wide eyes capable of great speed carrying it."
Sundara Kanda,8,7,"That Hanuma the best among Vanara warriors saw there a best plane with the name of Pushpaka with a more beautiful appearance than a group of flowers during spring, a more attractive appearance than even the spring season."
Sundara Kanda,8,8,"Thus, this is the 8th chapter in Sundara Kanda of Valmiki Ramayana, the First Epic poem of India."
Sundara Kanda,9,1,"Hanuma, the son of Vayu, saw a best tall building and a wide one in the middle of that best group of houses."
Sundara Kanda,9,2,That building of Ravana filled with many edifices was half a Yojana long and one Yojana tall.
Sundara Kanda,9,3,"Hanuma, the destructor of enemies, moved around in all directions searching for Seetha the wide eyed daughter of King of Videha"
Sundara Kanda,9,4,"Thereafter, Hanuma the glorious one neared and observed the best residence of Rakshasas and the house of Ravana, containing elephants with four tusks and also those with three tusks, those with two tusks and still not crowded. It was protected by soldiers bearing raised weapons."
Sundara Kanda,9,5,"That building surrounded by the wives of Ravana, by demonesses, and princesses brought by strength, was like an ocean filled with crocodiles, big fishes, sharks and other fishes, moved by the speed of wind, and together with serpants."
Sundara Kanda,9,6,"Whatever wealth is at Kubera, whatever riches at Indra with green horses, all that affluence was at Ravana's house. That wealth was always without reduction."
Sundara Kanda,9,7,"Whatever was the fortune of Kubera the King of Yakshas, of Yama and of Varuna, the same fortune or even greater treasure was at this house of Ravana."
Sundara Kanda,9,8,"Hanuma saw another house in the middle of that house, a well built one consisting of many elephants in rut."
Sundara Kanda,9,9,"Whatever wonderful aeroplane by the name of Pushpaka, decorated with all kinds of precious stones, made by Visvakarma in heaven for lord Brahma, whatever plane Kubera obtained by great austerity from Lord Brahma, Ravana obtained that plane by prowess defeating Kubera."
Sundara Kanda,9,10,"Supported by pillars decorated with images of wolves, with silver and golden hue and which were well made, radiant with splendour, decorated all around with rooms equalling Mount Meru and Mount Mandara, as though touching the sky with an auspicious shape."
Sundara Kanda,9,11,"Well made by Visvakarma and resembling Fire and Sun in splendour, with stairways made of gold and with beautiful and best platforms;"
Sundara Kanda,9,12,"With windows and ventilation holes made of gold and also made of crystal, with platforms made of sapphires and emeralds;"
Sundara Kanda,9,13,"Shone by floors embellished with corals of strange hue and with precious stones of great value, with pearls without comparison;"
Sundara Kanda,9,14,"Reddish and resembling gold, together with sandal wood having a good smell and brilliant like the Sun at noon;"
Sundara Kanda,9,15,The great Hanuma alighted the best aeroplane called Pushpaka with an excellent form decorated by rows of upper floors.
Sundara Kanda,9,16,"That Hanuma then being there, smelled a wonderful sweet fragrance like wind with an appearance, created from drinks and foods, including cooked rice diffused on all sides."
Sundara Kanda,9,17,"That sweet smell was as though saying thus to that Hanuma : ""Come here!"", like a relative to a best relative pointing to there wherever that Ravana was."
Sundara Kanda,9,18,"Hanuma started thereafter there (in that direction) and saw an auspicious great hall, close to heart of Ravana, like a delightful best woman."
Sundara Kanda,9,19,"That hall was made of stairways embedded with diamonds, decorated with golden windows, with a floor embellished with crystal, with shapes made from ivory in the middle."
Sundara Kanda,9,20,"Well decorated with pearls, corals and also with silver and gold and with diamond studded pillars and also decorated with many pillars."
Sundara Kanda,9,21,"By pillars slightly bent with no distortion, which were very tall and well decorated all over, that hall was as though starting for sky with very high wings."
Sundara Kanda,9,22,"Covered by a wonderful large carpet with all earth's characteristics like rivers, mountains, oceans, forests, painted over, that hall was like the vast earth together with states and rows of houses."
Sundara Kanda,9,23,"It was resounded by birds in heat, made fragrant by excellent perfumes, hung with best tapestries and inhabited by the king of rakshasas"
Sundara Kanda,9,24,"It was made smokey by the fumes of agallocum. It was a pure one white like a swan, wonderful by the decoration of flowers, like divine cow with a great radiance."
Sundara Kanda,9,25,"That excellent hall was causing happiness to heart, causing a fair complexion, destroying sorrow and was as though producing prosperity."
Sundara Kanda,9,26,"Like a mother, then that hall governed by Ravana caused satisfaction to all five sensory organs with all the excellent five objects of the senses."
Sundara Kanda,9,27,"Hanuma thought thus : ""This is heaven! This is indeed the abode of Devas! This is a city of Indra. This might be the result of a great austerity."""
Sundara Kanda,9,28,"Like gamblers defeated by greater gamblers in gambling, Hanuma saw golden hued lamps being still, as though in thought."
Sundara Kanda,9,29,"Hanuma thought thus : ""This building shines by the light of lamps and the brilliance of Ravana and also due to the radiance of jewellery."""
Sundara Kanda,9,30,Thereafter Hanuma saw a thousand of best women sitting on the rug with clothing of various colours and decorated in a variety of ways.
Sundara Kanda,9,31,"Then at the turn of midnight, those women slept deeply resting after playing during night, with a deep sleep caused by liquor."
Sundara Kanda,9,32,"That sleeping group of women, adorned with jewels which were not making sound, shone like a great park of lotuses with calm swans and bees."
Sundara Kanda,9,33,"Hanuma saw faces of those best women, with teeth covered by lips with closed eyes and with lotus fragrance."
Sundara Kanda,9,34,"At that time, those faces shone which became like lotuses in blossom during day time and again were like lotuses with closed petals at night."
Sundara Kanda,9,35,Hanuma thought that drunk bees definitely are desiring again and again these lotus faces like lotuses in blossom.
Sundara Kanda,9,36,"The glorious great Hanuma thought as above by recourse to reason. He also thought thus ""Those faces equal lotuses by their qualities such as beauty, fragrance, and others""."
Sundara Kanda,9,37,"That hall of Ravana's being shone by those women, glittered like a calm cloudless sky in autumn shone by stars."
Sundara Kanda,9,38,That lord of Rakshasas surrounded by those women shone like the radiant moon surrounded by stars.
Sundara Kanda,9,39,"Then Hanuma thought thus : ""Whatever meteors together with residue of piety fall down from the sky, all those meteors had been together as these women""."
Sundara Kanda,9,40,"There the luster, complexion and grace of those women clearly resembled great stars which emitted an auspicious radience."
Sundara Kanda,9,41,"Those women with dishevelled large thick garlands and scattered excellent jewels during the time of drinking, dancing etc., were with consciousness stolen by sleep."
Sundara Kanda,9,42,"Best women with disturbed sacred marks (tilaka) on forehead became with displaced anklets, became with necklaces fallen off to side."
Sundara Kanda,9,43,"Some other women became tied with pearl necklaces, some others became with tied-up waist ornaments (and) resembled young female horses who had walked long."
Sundara Kanda,9,44,"Some others wearing nice earrings with flower garlands that were torn and disturbed, resembled creepers, tread upon by an elephant in a big forest."
Sundara Kanda,9,45,Big pearl necklaces with the radiance of moon-rays in the middle of breasts of some other women shone like sleeping swans.
Sundara Kanda,9,46,"And of some other women, necklaces made with cat's eye gems resembled birds called Kadambas and for some others golden chains were like Chakravaka birds."
Sundara Kanda,9,47,"Those women with buttocks resembling sand dunes, shone like rivers filled with swans and birds called Karandas and decorated by Chakravaka birds."
Sundara Kanda,9,48,"Those sleeping women shone like rivers with their smiles as flower buds, with golden jewellery as big lotuses, with their behaviours as crocodiles, with fame as banks."
Sundara Kanda,9,49,"Auspicious lines of decoration which were on smooth parts of some other women and on nipples, were like jewellery."
Sundara Kanda,9,50,"Edges of clothing (worn by them) disturbed by air from breathing of some other women, were being fluttered again and again on their faces."
Sundara Kanda,9,51,"Those edges of clothes with various beautiful colours, shone at the base of Ravana's wives' throats like hoisted flags of beautiful shine."
Sundara Kanda,9,52,"Here ear-rings of some beautiful women with a good glory, also moved lightly due to the air from breathing of those women."
Sundara Kanda,9,53,"Then comforting breath from the faces of those women, by nature fragrant with the smell of liquor made of Sarkara, served Ravana."
Sundara Kanda,9,54,Some women of Ravana smelled co-wives' faces again and again imagining them to be face of Ravana.
Sundara Kanda,9,55,"Those best women with greatly devoted mind in Ravana, then not being on own will, brought delight only to their co-wives."
Sundara Kanda,9,56,"Some other women slept there, making as pillows their arms decorated with bracelets and beautiful clothes."
Sundara Kanda,9,57,"Another woman slept on another's bosom, again another woman slept on her shoulder, another woman slept on another woman's thigh and another slept on her breasts."
Sundara Kanda,9,58,"Overcome with heat and friendship, they resorted to thighs, sides, waist and back of one another, with mutual limbs placed on one another."
Sundara Kanda,9,59,That garland of women tied with the rope of each other's shoulders shone like a flower garland with dragon flies on it tied in thread.
Sundara Kanda,9,60,"That group of women of Ravana, tied by each other as garland with mixed group of flowers, with beautiful shoulders entwined promiscuously, hair like an exalted garden with a flower garland tied together of creepers in bloom due to the caress of the lord of wind in the vernal in the month of Vaisakha, with entwined beautiful trees."
Sundara Kanda,9,61,"Then it was not possible to make clear the knowledge of jewellery, body parts and clothes of those women even for those used to them."
Sundara Kanda,9,62,"While Ravana slept comfortably, golden lamps shining brilliant, were as though seeing without closing eyes, those women of various glows."
Sundara Kanda,9,63,"Women of royal sages, brahmanas and demons and of Gandharvas, of Rakshasas - all those unmarried girls surrendered from lust to Ravana."
Sundara Kanda,9,64,"All those women had been stolen by Ravana with a desire for war, some together with heat of youth obtained Ravana being desired by god of love."
Sundara Kanda,9,65,"There, even one woman had not been obtained forcefully by the strong Ravana, except for that daughter of Janaka, Seetha. Every other woman had been obtained by her character alone and there was no woman who had desire in another man, and there also was none with another lover."
Sundara Kanda,9,66,"And there was no wife of his without a good lineage, there was no one with less beauty, no one without skill, no one without service, none with low intellect, no one without causing desire to lover."
Sundara Kanda,9,67,"Following thought occurred to Hanuma with a pious mind : ""It would have been good for this Ravana if the virtuous wife of Rama had been left happy with her husband in the same such manner as these wives of the king of rakshasas."""
Sundara Kanda,9,68,"Hanuma became gloomy and thought thus: ""Seetha is definitely the best by virtues; then this lord of Lanka even though being great otherwise, did an evil and an un-gentlemanly deed with her."
Sundara Kanda,9,69,"Thus, this is the 9th chapter in Sundara Kanda of Valmiki Ramayana, the First Epic poem of India."
Sundara Kanda,10,1,"In that house, while observing, Hanuma saw a portion of house with beds and couches, consisting of best couches equaling those in heaven, made of crystal decorated with diamonds, with wonderful parts made of ivory and gold, covered with best beds made of cat's eye gems of great value."
Sundara Kanda,10,2,"Hanuma saw in a part of that room, an umbrella white in colour decorated with best flower garlands and resembling moon - the lord of stars."
Sundara Kanda,10,3,"Hanuma saw an excellent couch made of gold with radiance equaling that of fire, spread by garlands of Ashoka flowers."
Sundara Kanda,10,4,Fanned by women with fans in their hands in all the four directions and obtained by various fragrances fumigated by the best incense.
Sundara Kanda,10,5,"Covered by an excellent bed, spread by sheep skin everywhere and shone by rows of excellent garlands."
Sundara Kanda,10,6,"Hanuma saw Ravana in that house, equaling a cloud, wearing earrings with a brilliant shine with red eyes and with long arms wearing gold clothes."
Sundara Kanda,10,7,"With his body smeared with red sandal-wood with good fragrance like a cloud in the red sky at sunset, together with groups of lightening."
Sundara Kanda,10,8,"Ravana was filled with excellent jewellery, with a good appearance, with an ability to assume desired form, resembling mount Mandara in sleep, together with groups of trees and bushes."
Sundara Kanda,10,9,"Resting after having pleasure at night, bedecked with the best ornaments, he was a lover to the rakshasa girls and causing comfort to rakshasas."
Sundara Kanda,10,10,That great Hanuma saw the gallant king of rakshasas in sleep on a shining couch resting after drinking.
Sundara Kanda,10,11,"That Hanuma, best among Vanaras neared Ravana, became very gloomy and moved away with great dread, as though from a hissing serpent."
Sundara Kanda,10,12,"Thereafter the great Hanuma neared staircase, sought another dais and observed closely Ravana."
Sundara Kanda,10,13,The excellent couch of the sleeping Ravana shone like a great lake when a scented elephant resides in it.
Sundara Kanda,10,14,"That Hanuma also saw the wealthy Ravana's arms tied with golden armlets thrown apart, resembling flag staffs raised in honor of Indra."
Sundara Kanda,10,15,Those arms had wounds made by stabbing from the pointed edges of tusks of Iraavata and fleshy shoulders smeared with diamond and hit by Vishnu chakra.
Sundara Kanda,10,16,"These arms of Ravana were corpulent with well grown and equal strong shoulders proportionate to body, with knees and thumbs of good characteristics, with good fingers and palms."
Sundara Kanda,10,17,"With strong joints in the shape of club, round in shape resembling the trunks of an elephant, like five headed snakes thrown on clean couch."
Sundara Kanda,10,18,"Shoulders well smeared by best sandal with good smell and very cool resembling in color to a hare's blood, well decorated, massaged by the best women, served by the best sandal and which made yakshas, nagas, gandharvas, devas and daanavaas scream."
Sundara Kanda,10,19,That Hanuma saw there arms on the couch like great serpents in anger sleeping in the middle of mount Mandara.
Sundara Kanda,10,20,"That king of Rakshasas equaling a mountain with those shoulders, which were well built and shone like Mount Mandara with twin peaks."
Sundara Kanda,10,21,"From the great face of that king of Rakshasas who was sleeping, came out breath with fragrance like that of flowers of chuuta and punnaaga, consisting of the best fragrance of Vakula flowers, together with the flavor of best cooked rice, with the smell of liquor as though filling that house."
Sundara Kanda,10,22,"That Hanuma saw in the house of that king of Rakshasa's, wives at the feet, Ravana being a gigantic one with loving wives, shone with crown tilted to the side, having strange hue with pearls and diamonds and of golden colour, with a face made brilliant by earrings, shone with the chest region smeared with red sandal, shining with a necklace wide, high and corpulent with a silk cloth of white colour falling on him, with eyes reddish like blood, well tied by a best cloth of yellow colour and of very best quality, resembling a heap of black beans, snoring like a hiss of a snake, like an elephant sleeping in the middle of water belonging to the great river Ganga with all the four directions shone by the four lamps of golden colour, resembling a cloud with all the parts being shone by groups of lighting."
Sundara Kanda,10,23,"The leader of Vanaras saw those wives of Ravana with faces with radiance of moon, adorned with beautiful earrings, wearing jewellery and flower garlands which were not worn out."
Sundara Kanda,10,24,"Hanuma saw wives of Ravana with skill in dance and musical instruments, who obtained the shoulders of Ravana wearing the best jewellery and being in sleep."
Sundara Kanda,10,25,He saw earrings of those women at the end of ears with embedded diamonds and cats eye gems and having golden colour.
Sundara Kanda,10,26,With the faces of those women with delicate earrings which were equal to moon and auspicious that house shone like the sky with clusters of stars.
Sundara Kanda,10,27,Women of that Ravana being tired from lustful passion and exertion and having lean waists slept at first opportunity.
Sundara Kanda,10,28,Another woman with skill in dancing consisting of delicate body postures slept in the same way with all her body parts making the same dance postures.
Sundara Kanda,10,29,One woman hugging veena and sleeping was shining like a lotus plant thrown away by the flow of a great river and resorting a boat.
Sundara Kanda,10,30,Another woman with black eyes sleeping with an instrument called madduka under arm pit shone like a woman carrying an infant boy with love.
Sundara Kanda,10,31,"A woman with beautiful body features and with beautiful breasts slept tightly and hugged instrument called pataha as though hugging a lover, getting him after a long time."
Sundara Kanda,10,32,Another woman with lotus like eyes hugging a flute slept like a woman with lust holding her lover in secret.
Sundara Kanda,10,33,Another woman skilled in dance obtained sleep getting an instrument like veena and being in tune with it like a woman together with her lover.
Sundara Kanda,10,34,Another woman with lusty eyes slept hugging a percussion instrument called mridanga with her body parts which were pleasant which resembled gold and which were smooth and fleshy.
Sundara Kanda,10,35,"Another woman with thin stomach, who was not to be blamed, slept due to tiresomeness from lust together with an instrument called Padama between her shoulders and reaching arm pits."
Sundara Kanda,10,36,Another woman with an instrument called Dindima near her slept in the same way as a woman hugging her husband and also her child.
Sundara Kanda,10,37,Another woman with eyes like lotus petals slept making the instrument called adambara pressing it by her shoulders being desired by lust.
Sundara Kanda,10,38,"Another woman sleeping, felling down a small pot, shone like a flower garland with the flowers of strange hue made auspicious in spring."
Sundara Kanda,10,39,"Another woman slept hugging her breasts resembling golden pots by her hands, overcome with sleep."
Sundara Kanda,10,40,"Another woman with eyes like lotus petals, with her face resembling full moon, overcome with lust slept hugging another woman with a beautiful hip region."
Sundara Kanda,10,41,Some excellent women slept hugging strange instruments and pressing them with breasts as though lustful woman with lusty men.
Sundara Kanda,10,42,That Hanuma saw among those women a very beautiful woman sleeping on an auspicious couch arranged alone at a side.
Sundara Kanda,10,43,"Hanuma saw Mandodari with a beautiful form together with diamonds and pearls, well decorated by jewellery and with her self radiance as though decorating that great building with a fair complexion and with a radiance like golden colour, who was dear to her husband the lady of women in that gynaeceum sleeping there."
Sundara Kanda,10,44,"That Hanuma with great arms seeing the woman well decorated, out of logic thought thus: ""This is Seetha by the wealth of her appearance and her youth"". That warrior of Vanaras was delighted together with great pleasure."
Sundara Kanda,10,45,"He clasped his arms, kissed his tail he was delighted, he was playful, sang, paced showing his simian nature, climbed pillars and fell down on land."
Sundara Kanda,11,1,The great Hanuma then removing that thought became with the right mind and had another thought about Seetha.
Sundara Kanda,11,2,"That Seetha is not suitable to sleep separated from Rama, will not eat, will not decorate also, not suited to drink a beverage, to reach another man even though if he were Indra because there is indeed no one equaling Rama even among gods. This is another woman - thus deciding that Hanuma paced in that banqueting hall."
Sundara Kanda,11,3,Some women were tired from erotic dalliance and then some other women were tired from singing; some others were weary from dance and were unconscious from consumption of liquor.
Sundara Kanda,11,4,"Some women were stationed on tabors, on Mrudangas, on seats, some other women rested on chief carpets."
Sundara Kanda,11,5,"The warrior among Vanaras saw a thousand of women decorated by jewellery with a nature of talking about beauty, conversing about the correct meaning of songs being sung, behaving according to time and place, wont to speak appropriate words, indulged in sleep after sexual dalliance."
Sundara Kanda,11,6,"In the middle of that group of women, Ravana with great arms shone like a bull in the middle of cows in a big cow-pen."
Sundara Kanda,11,7,"That Ravana himself surrounded by those women, shone like a great elephant surrounded by she elephants in a great forest."
Sundara Kanda,11,8,"The best among Vanaras saw in that wealthy Ravana's house a bar also, consisting of all desirables."
Sundara Kanda,11,9,"Hanuma saw there in that bar, meat of dear and of buffalo, of wild boar kept separately."
Sundara Kanda,11,10,The best among Vanaras saw half eaten peacocks and chicken in wide vessels of golden colour.
Sundara Kanda,11,11,"Hanuma observed meat of pigs and goats, porcupines, deer and peacocks preserved in curds and sochal salt."
Sundara Kanda,11,12,"Hanuma saw birds called Krakara cooked ready to be eaten in variety of ways, birds called Chakoras half eaten, wild buffalos, fishes called ekashleya, goats, food to be licked of various kinds, beverages and various foods."
Sundara Kanda,11,13,"In the same way that floor was obtaining glory greatly with Ragas and Shadabas seasoned with sour and salty sauces, with necklaces, anklets and armlets of great value thrown around, with various fruits left in drinking vessels, with flowers sprinkled."
Sundara Kanda,11,14,"That bar was seen as though radiant without fire, with couches and chairs well arranged and placed there and there."
Sundara Kanda,11,15,"Many meats of different kinds cultured with various best seasonings, well arranged separately obtained that bar."
Sundara Kanda,11,16,"Excellent and clear various liquors, a liquor called Sura, liquor made of sugar, liquor made of honey, liquor made of flowers and liquors made of fruits also, artificially made liquors - those and those were cultured separately with various fragrant powders."
Sundara Kanda,11,17,"The floor shone filled by flower garlands in a variety of forms, with various vessels of golden hue and also made of crystal, filled with other small vessels of golden colour."
Sundara Kanda,11,18,Hanuma saw indeed then lot of best quality liquor in pots of silver and of golden colour.
Sundara Kanda,11,19,"That great Hanuma saw vessels full of liquor of golden colour, embedded with gem stones and also of silver hue."
Sundara Kanda,11,20,That Hanuma saw indeed at some places drinks half filled and at some places completely drunk and some places not at all drunk.
Sundara Kanda,11,21,"Hanuma paced about seeing at some places various eatables and at some places drinks separately, and at some places remnants of cooked rice."
Sundara Kanda,11,22,"Hanuma saw some places with vessels broken, some places with pots in shambles, some places with water together with flower garlands and fruits."
Sundara Kanda,11,23,"Here couches again of women were varied and clean, some best women slept there hugging one another."
Sundara Kanda,11,24,Some women conquered by the power of sleep pulled other sleeping women's clothing and slept covering themselves.
Sundara Kanda,11,25,Clothing and garland on the throats of those women was moving slightly and wonderfully as though obtaining air from the air of breath.
Sundara Kanda,11,26,"There wind blew carrying in a lot of directions, a variety of fragrances of cool sandal-paste and of sweet liquor, of various flower garlands and of various kinds of agallocum fumes."
Sundara Kanda,11,27,Then the blossoming fragrance from the baths and sandal paste and from agallocum fumes blew spreading all around in that Pushpaka plane.
Sundara Kanda,11,28,"There in that Ravana's house, some women had fair and white complexion some best women were black, some women had a body of golden complexion."
Sundara Kanda,11,29,"Appearance of those sleeping women, tired from being possessed by sleep and from lust, was like lotuses sleeping."
Sundara Kanda,11,30,Hanuma with great radiance thus saw entire Ravana's house completely but did not see Seetha.
Sundara Kanda,11,31,Then that Hanuma seeing those women obtained great anguish being in doubt because of fear in the matter of dharma.
Sundara Kanda,11,32,"""My seeing sleeping house of other people's wives will do a great deficit to dharma."""
Sundara Kanda,11,33,"""My sight is indeed not in the matter of other wives here. These other's wives have been seen by me."""
Sundara Kanda,11,34,"To that Hanuma with an excellent mind, with a fixed and concentrated mind, was born another thought again, showing a fixed resolve in the task at hand."
Sundara Kanda,11,35,"""All Ravana's women who were in faith could have been seen by me; to my mind there indeed was not even a little disturbance""."
Sundara Kanda,11,36,"""Among auspicious or inauspicious states in the behavior of all senses mind is the reason. My that mind is very steady."""

Sundara Kanda,15,14,"Observing that woman with wide eyes, very untidy, emaciated, Hanuma thought that this is indeed Seetha on logical grounds."
Sundara Kanda,15,15,"Then, while being abducted by that rakshasa with the ability to assume desired form in whatever way, She was seen, this woman has the same form."
Sundara Kanda,15,16,"Hanuma saw Seetha with a face like full moon, with beautiful eyebrows, with graceful rounded breasts, by the radiance making all directions without darkness, goddess like with black hair, with lips like bimba fruit, with a good waist, very firm, with eyes like lotus petals, like Rati the consort of god of love."

Sundara Kanda,15,25,"Hanuma recognized with great sorrow Seetha not decorated, like a sentence which got a different meaning being devoid of culture."
Sundara Kanda,15,26,"Seeing that princess, the wide eyed one, blameless one, Hanuma reasoned her to be Seetha for the following reasons."
Sundara Kanda,15,27,"Then Hanuma saw whatever groups of jewellery of Seetha on various parts Rama spoke, those charming Her limbs, well made earrings, well fitting Svadamstras and ornaments wonderful with diamonds on the limbs of Her hands, belonging to body for long time, blackened and making marks on body."
Sundara Kanda,15,28,"""I think all these to be same about which Rama spoke; among them whatever have been worn out those I will not see; whatever jewels of Her are not worn out these are they - no doubt."""

Sundara Kanda,18,9,While He was going only a hundred of women followed that Ravana like Deva and Gandharva women following Indra.
Sundara Kanda,18,10,There some women bore lamps of gold; some others carried chowries; some others had fans of Palmyra leaves in their hands.
Sundara Kanda,18,11,Some women carried water in small vessels of gold; some others followed in the back taking pillows with circular ends.
Sundara Kanda,18,12,One woman to the right of Ravana held with her right hand a vessel with gem stones filled with liqour.
Sundara Kanda,18,13,Another woman went at back taking an umbrella equalling a royal swan with the radiance of full moon with a golden handle.

Sundara Kanda,18,16,"Husband of those women, of great might, who was surrendered to lust, that Ravana also who was dull witted, with his mind interested in Seetha shone with a slow and beautiful gait."
Sundara Kanda,18,17,"Thereafter that Hanuma, the son of wind-god heard the sound of waist-bands and the sound of anklets of those excellent women."
Sundara Kanda,18,18,"Hanuma the monkey saw that Ravana also, performer of deeds without an equal, with unfathomable might and virility, reaching the entrance region."
Sundara Kanda,18,19,"Wettened by fragrant oil, being carried in front of Ravana, Hanuma saw Ravana being shone in all directions by many lamps."
Sundara Kanda,18,20,"Hanuma saw Ravana together with lust, vanity and intoxication, with wide red eyes which were slanted, like the god of love in person with bow kept at a distance."
Sundara Kanda,18,21,"Hanuma saw Ravana playfully readjusting his excellent upper garment with the luster of churned nectar froth, without stain,slipping being entangled in armlet."
Sundara Kanda,18,22,Hanuma blended in a branch full of leaves covered by groups of leaves and flowers started to see that Ravana as though coming near Him.
Sundara Kanda,18,23,"Thereafter Hanuma, the best among Vanaras looking in all directions saw best women of Ravana full of beauty and youth."
Sundara Kanda,18,24,"King of great fame, Ravana, together with those women with good appearance entered that garden resounded by animals and birds."
Sundara Kanda,18,25,"That king of Rakshasas who was intoxicated with wonderful ornaments, with pointed ears, son of Visravasa was like the moon together with stars, together with best women was seen by Hanuma. That great Vanara with great brilliance saw that Ravana with glory."
Sundara Kanda,18,26,"The son of god of wind Vanara Hanuma of great brilliance thinking thus ""This long armed one is Ravana"", jumped down."
Sundara Kanda,18,27,Thus Hanuma although of terrible energy was overshadowed by Ravana's brilliance and became rooted behind a group of leaves and was concealed.
Sundara Kanda,18,28,"That Ravana neared Seetha with black hair, with charming limbs with well knit breasts, with black corners of eyes, wishing to see Her."
Sundara Kanda,19,1,Thereafter at that time Seetha a princess without any blame of excellent limbs shook like a plantain tree in wind on seeing Ravana the king of rakshasas endowed with beauty and youth adorned with excellent ornaments.
Sundara Kanda,19,2,The wide eyed Seetha with excellent color covering stomach with thighs and breasts with hands sat down crying.
Sundara Kanda,19,3,Ravana saw Seetha protected by batches of ogres looking miserable being struck with grief like a ship in danger in the sea.
Sundara Kanda,19,4,"Hanuma saw Seetha sitting down on uncovered land, with a firm resolve, like a branch of a tree fallen down on earth being torn from the tree."
Sundara Kanda,19,5,"Hanuma saw Seetha with a stange body with dirt as ornament, who although suited to decorate with ornaments was without ornaments. Although She was shining like a lotus stem covered with mud, She was not shining also."
Sundara Kanda,19,6,Seetha was as though going near to Rama a lion among kings with a famous personality with desires as chariot tied with thoughts as horses.
Sundara Kanda,19,7,"Seetha a pleasant one, was emaciated, was crying, being alone having surrendered to Her thoughts and sorrow not seeing the end of grief, following the will of Rama."
Sundara Kanda,19,8,And also Seetha was like a great she-serpant writhing under the spell of an incantation. She was like Rohini being fumigated by a smoke colored planet called Ketu.
Sundara Kanda,19,9,"Being born in a virtuous traditional family with good conduct and character and getting married, Seetha appeared as if She was born in a bad family."
Sundara Kanda,19,10,Seetha was like fame fallen down due to false blame. She was like education ruined due to lack of learning by heart.

Sundara Kanda,19,14,"Seetha was like an altar desecrated, like a tongue of fire gone out, like a full moon night with moon devoured by Rahu."
Sundara Kanda,19,15,"Seetha was like a lotus pond agitated with torned out leaves and lotuses, being roughly traeated by the trunk of an elephant."
Sundara Kanda,19,16,"Grieved for husband, Seetha was like a river which has dried uo with water caused to flow out lacking best washing, was like a new moon night."
Sundara Kanda,19,17,"Seetha was a delicate one with well built limbs, accustomed to houses full of diamonds, being tormented by heat, like a lotus fibre uprooted short time back."
Sundara Kanda,19,18,"Seetha was like a she-elephant captured and tied to a pillar, made to be without the leader of herd, sighing, very much tormented by grief."
Sundara Kanda,19,19,"With a long single plait, shining without effort, Seetha was like the earth with dark groups of trees at the end of rainy season."
Sundara Kanda,19,20,"Wasted, emaciated due to fasting, due to sorrow, due to thought and due to fear, Seetha was with limited food and with austerity as wealth."

Sundara Kanda,40,21,"Having been appraised of the matter by Seetha the princess, having accomplished his object, having his mind filled with joy and having perceived that only a little remained to be done, Hanuma intellectually sought the northern direction."
Sundara Kanda,41,1,"Seetha honoured Hanuma, who was ready to go, with good words. Hanuma, having gone to a distance from that place, thought within himself (as follows):"
Sundara Kanda,41,2,"""I have seen this black-eyed Seetha. There is only a little that remains to be done by me. Abandoning the three strategies for success viz. sowing dissension, negotiation and bribery, I have to implement here the fourth strategy viz. open assault."""
Sundara Kanda,41,3,"""In the case of demons, the strategy of negotiation is not practicable. For those persons having abundant wealth, the strategy of bribery is not suitable. For persons who are proud of their strength, the strategy of sowing dissension is not amenable. Prowess alone is agreeable for me here."""

Sundara Kanda,41,12,"""Thereupon Ravana will order for an army consisting of horses, great chariots and elephants and armed with weapons like great tridents and spears made of iron. Then, a great combat will follow."""
Sundara Kanda,41,13,"""Attacking those demons of terrific prowess, I too with my unbearable prowess, will kill that army instigated by Ravana and return to the place of Sugreeva happily."""
Sundara Kanda,41,14,"Thereafter, Hanuma of terrific prowess, getting angry, started then to throw away trees by a highly violent jerk of his thighs akin to the jerk of a wind."
Sundara Kanda,41,15,"Then, the valiant Hanuma laid waste the royal garden attached to the gynaecium resonant with cries of birds in heat and endowed with various kinds of trees and creepers."
Sundara Kanda,41,16,"Hanuma damaged trees in that grove, destroyed the ponds and crushed the tops of pleasure hills to powder. Thus, that grove became nasty at sight."
Sundara Kanda,41,17,"With its trees and creepers dried up, with the howls of various birds, with its ponds destroyed, with its copper-coloured sprouts dried up there, that grove did not look bright, as though it had been destroyed by a wild fire. Those creepers with their bars of support displaced, fell down like distressed woman."
Sundara Kanda,41,18,"""With its arbours and picture-galleries destroyed, its great serpents and wild animals emitting cries of distress, its grottos and other structures demolished, that grove became defaced."
Sundara Kanda,41,19,"""That woody land of that pleasure-garden which afforded shelter to the women-folk of Ravana and which has clusters of Ashoka creepers became a jumble of creepers of sorrow for the distressed women; by the violence of Hanuma."""

Sundara Kanda,42,1,"At the screaming sound of birds and at the sound of the crash of falling trees, all the inhabitants of Lanka then became trembled with fear."
Sundara Kanda,42,2,"Made to run to-and-fro and getting frightened, beasts and birds began to scream. Atrocious omens made their appearance before the demons."
Sundara Kanda,42,3,"Then, the ugly-faced female-demons, whose sleep has vanished, found that grove demolished and saw that great heroic monkey."
Sundara Kanda,42,4,"Seeing those female-demons, the mighty armed Hanuma endowed with a great courage and might, assumed a gigantic form which created a terror to the female-demons."
Sundara Kanda,42,5,"Beholding that mighty monkey having a gigantic body similar to a mountain, the female-demons then asked Seetha (as follows):"
Sundara Kanda,42,6,"""Who is he? Whose messenger is he? From where and for what purpose he has come here? Wherefore a conversation was held by him with you?"""
Sundara Kanda,42,7,"""O large-eyed Seetha! Tell us. Let there be no fear for you, O fortunate lady! What did he speak to you? O lady having black outer eye-corners!"""
Sundara Kanda,42,8,"Thereupon Seetha the virtuous lady, having a complete beauty of all limbs, spoke as follows: ""Where is the ability for me to know about the demons of a terrific form?"""
Sundara Kanda,42,9,"""You alone can recognise who he is and what he does. A serpent only can recognise the feet of another serpent. There is no doubt about it."""
Sundara Kanda,42,10,"""By seeing him, I too get frightened. I do not know who he is. I only know him as a demon, able to assume any form at his will, who arrived here."""
Sundara Kanda,42,11,Hearing the words of Seetha some female-demons fled to different directions. Some stayed back. Some others went to Ravana to inform about the matter.
Sundara Kanda,42,12,"After approaching Ravana, the female demons of ugly faces started to tell (as follows) of the monstrous and terrific monkey."
Sundara Kanda,42,13,"""O king! A monkey having a terrific body and a boundless prowess, is stationed in the middle of Ashoka grove and made a conversation with Seetha."""
Sundara Kanda,42,14,"""Eventhough questioned in many ways by us, Seetha, the daughter of Janaka, having eyes similar to those of a doe, is not inclined to tell about the monkey."""
Sundara Kanda,42,15,"""He may be a messenger of Indra the Lord of celestials, or the messenger of Kubera the king of riches or even a messenger sent by Rama to search for Seetha."""
Sundara Kanda,42,16,"""He, having a wonderful form, has wiped off your grove, attached to the gynaecium, which is fascinating and extending with many kinds of animal-flock."""
Sundara Kanda,42,17,"""There is no place whatsoever in that grove, which was not destroyed by him. Only that place, where Seetha the daughter of Janaka was sitting, was not destroyed by him."""
Sundara Kanda,42,18,"""It is not known whether to protect Seetha or because of fatigue, he has left that place undestroyed, or else, what fatigue is there for him? He has done it to protect Seetha."""
Sundara Kanda,42,19,"""That well-grown Simsupa tree, abounding in charming sprouts and flowers, under which Seetha herself took shelter, has been spared by him."""
Sundara Kanda,42,20,To that terribly looking monkey by whom Seetha was spoken to and that grove destroyed you to order a terrible punishment.
Sundara Kanda,42,21,"""O chief of the demons-troops! Who would dare to talk to that Seetha, who has been mentally accepted by you, except perhaps he who is ready to abandon his life?"""
Sundara Kanda,42,22,"Hearing the words of the female-demons, Ravana the lord of demons flared up like a funeral fire, his eyes spinning with anger."
Sundara Kanda,42,23,"Tears dropped from Ravana's enraged eyes, like drops of oil dripping from resplendent lamps."
Sundara Kanda,42,24,"Ravana, with a great splendour, sent demons with a valiance equal to him, called Kinkaras, in order to catch hold of Hanuma."
Sundara Kanda,42,25,"He ordered for eighty thousand of those Kinkaras who were strong. All those mighty Kinkaras with their large bellies, long tusks and terrible forms, longing to fight with iron mallets and clubs in hand, in eagerness to lay hold on Hanuma, started from that place."
Sundara Kanda,42,26,"Approaching Hanuma who was standing near the arched doorway, they rushed towards him with a great speed, like locusts rushing towards a fire."
Sundara Kanda,42,27,"They banged Hanuma with various kinds of maces, iron bludgeons plated with gold and arrows shining like the sun."
Sundara Kanda,42,28,"Quickly surrounding Hanuma with clubs, sharp edged spears, iron pikes, lances, javelins and swords, they stood in front of him."
Sundara Kanda,42,29,"The highly splendorous and illustrious Hanuma too, looking like a mountain, hurled his tail on the ground, making a thunderous noise."
Sundara Kanda,42,30,"The highly splendourous and illustrious Hanuma too, looking like a mountain, hurled his tail on the ground, making a thunderous noise."
Sundara Kanda,42,31,"By that great sound made by Hanuma through clapping on his arms together with a resound, birds fell down from the sky. Hanuma also then cried aloud with a clamorous voice (as follows):"
Sundara Kanda,42,32,"""Long live the mighty Rama and the powerful Lakshmana! Long live the King Sugreeva, protected by Rama!"""
Sundara Kanda,42,33,"""I am Hanuma, the destroyer of the army of adversaries and the son of wind-god. I am the servant of Rama, the king of Kosala Kingdom, who is unwearied in action."""

Sundara Kanda,42,36,Those demons became frightened by the clamorous voice of Hanuma cried aloud and saw him to be as high as a twilight rain-cloud.
Sundara Kanda,42,37,"Not feeling apprehended because of the orders of their king, those demons thereafter rushed towards Hanuma, with their terrific and amazing weapons."
Sundara Kanda,42,38,"Surrounded on all sides by those strong demons, that Hanuma endowed with a great strength seized a huge iron bar belonging to the arched gate."
Sundara Kanda,42,39,"Taking that iron rod, Hanuma killed the demons. That violent Hanuma strolled in the sky, taking that iron rod in his hand, as Garuda the eagle would carrying a serpent in its claws."
Sundara Kanda,42,40,"Killing the valiant demons called Kinkaras, that heroic Hanuma wishing to fight again, arrived at the archy gate way."
Sundara Kanda,42,41,"Some demons, who somehow escaped from that terror, went to Ravana and informed him that all the Kinkaras have been killed."
Sundara Kanda,42,42,"Hearing of large army of demons having been killed, that Ravana with his eyes rolling rapidly (with anger), ordered Jambumali, son of Prahasta, who was unequal in prowess and admirably unconquerable in battle."
Sundara Kanda,43,1,"After killing the Kinkaras, that Hanuma thought to himself (as follows): ""The grove was damaged by me. The lofty palatial mansion of the sanctuary (sacred to the guardian-deity of the demons) has not been destroyed. For that reason, I will cause this mansion to crumble down in the same way."" Thus thinking himself, Hanuma the best among monkeys, son of the wind-god having large jaws, by showing his strength, bounced up and ascended the lofty palatial mansion of the sanctuary, which was as high as a mountain-top of Meru."
Sundara Kanda,43,2,"That Hanuma, an army-chief of monkeys, possessing a very great splendour, ascending the lofty palatial mansion similar to a mountain shone like a second rising sun."
Sundara Kanda,43,3,"Overpowering the lofty and inviolable of the sanctuary, Hanuma blazing mansion his splendour, meta morposed into a towering sized body equal to that of Pariyatra mountain."
Sundara Kanda,43,4,"Enhancing his body to a very big size by dint of his distinction, Hanuma clapped on his arms strongly, filling the City of Lanka with sound."
Sundara Kanda,43,5,"By the great deafening noise, made by clapping on his arms, the birds and also the guards protecting the sanctuary unconsciously fell down."
Sundara Kanda,43,6,"""Long live Rama, skilled in archery and the powerful Lakshmana! Long lie the King Sugreeva, protected by Rama! I am Hanuma, the destroyer of the army of adversaries and the son of wind-god. I am the servent of Rama, the king of Kosala kingdom, who is unwearied in action. Even a thousand of Ravanas will not be matching equally with me, who is capable of striking with thousnads of rocks and trees in battle. Here, before the eyes of all the demons, I will annihilate the City of Lanka and after offering salutation to Seetha, I will go back duly completing my task."""
Sundara Kanda,43,7,"Thus uttering to those guards protecting the sanctuary, roared terribly, making a noise and creating a terror to the demons."
Sundara Kanda,43,8,"Hearing that loud noise, hundreds of guards protecting the sanctuary went, taking many kinds of weapons, spears, swords and axes. Those Kinkaras with huge bodies surrounded Hanuma, duly discharging those weapons."
Sundara Kanda,43,9,"They banged Hanuma with various kinds of maces, iron bludgeons plated with gold and arrows shining like the sun. That troop of demons surrounding Hanuma the best among monkeys, shone like a greatly extensive whirlpool in the waters of River Ganga."
Sundara Kanda,43,10,"Thereupon, the enraged Hanuma assumed a terrific form. Hanuma possessing a gigantic body and the son of wind-god, uprooting a pillar with a hundred edges and decorated with gold in that edifice, then speedily whirled it around."
Sundara Kanda,43,11,"Fire was also generated there (due to friction with other pillars) The edifice was then consumed by fire. Seeing the edifice burning, that Hanuma killing those hundred demons, like Indra killing demons with his thunderbolt and gloriously staying in the sky, spoke (the following) words:"
Sundara Kanda,43,12,"""Thousands of monkeys like me, possessing gigantic bodies of strength, were sent on the orders of Sugreeva. We and other monkeys are now roaming the entire earth."""
Sundara Kanda,43,13,"""Some of the monkeys are having a strength of ten elephants. Some are having a strength of a hundred elephants. Some are having a prowess equal to that of a thousand elephants."""
Sundara Kanda,43,14,"""Some are having the strength of a strong stream. Some have strength equal to that of wind. Some other army-chiefs of monkeys even cannot be measured."""
Sundara Kanda,43,15,"""Surrounded by hundreds, myriads, lakhs and crores of such monkeys having their teeth and nails as their weapons, Sugreeva, who is capable of destroying you all, will come."""
Sundara Kanda,43,16,"""You hold enmity with the high souled Rama. For this, the City of Lanka will not be there. Neither you, nor even Ravana will survive."""
Sundara Kanda,44,1,"Jambumali, the demon with great tusks, wielding a bow, donning crimson garlands and clothes, wearing beautiful chaplet and charming ear-rings, possessing a gigantic body, having round and open eyes, the demon causing diseases, unconquerable in battle, a strong demon and the son of Prahasta, commanded by Ravana, started stretching with rashness his big bow resembling a rain bow garnished splendorous arrows and which brilliance was similar to that of a lightening and produced a sound like that of a thunder."
Sundara Kanda,44,2,"The tumultuous sound created out of the twanging of that bow, soon filled up the quarters, intermediate points and the sky."
Sundara Kanda,44,3,"Seeing him, arriving by a chariot yoked with donkeys, that Hanuma who was endowed with swiftness, was thrilled with joy and made a noise too."
Sundara Kanda,44,4,"The long-armed Jambumali transfixed sharp arrows into that great monkey, Hanuma who was standing on the top of the archy door-way."
Sundara Kanda,44,5,"He transfixed Hanuma the leader of monkeys in the face with an arrow with a crescent-shaped head, on the head with an arrow having an ear-shaped top and in the arms with ten steel arrows."
Sundara Kanda,44,6,"That crimson face of Hanuma, hit by an arrow, shone like a full-blown lotus touched by a sun's ray in autumn."
Sundara Kanda,44,7,"That face of Hanuma, which was naturally crimson in colour, smeared with blood, beamed like a large lotus in the sky sprinkled with drops of sandal."
Sundara Kanda,44,8,"Hanuma, struck by those arrows, was enraged with that demon and then saw by his side, a big rock of a very large measure."
Sundara Kanda,44,9,"Uplifting that rock with strength, the athletic Hanuma hurled it with force. The enraged demon then struck back that rock with ten arrows."
Sundara Kanda,44,10,"Seeing that work in vain, the powerful Hanuma of terrific prowess, uprooted a very large sal tree and whirled it around."
Sundara Kanda,44,11,"Seeing the mighty Hanuma, whirling around the sal tree, the exceedingly strong Jambumali discharged numerous arrows."
Sundara Kanda,44,12,"He splitted sal tree with four arrows and struck the arms of Hanuma with five arrows, in the chest with one arrow and in the space between the breast wit ten arrows."
Sundara Kanda,44,13,"Hanuma, with his body full of arrows, was highly enraged and taking the same iron rod as well as clasping it swiftly, whirled it around."
Sundara Kanda,44,14,"Spinning the iron rod with a great speed, Hanuma, richly endowed with strength and highly agitated, threw it on the broad chest of Jamubumali."
Sundara Kanda,44,15,"That Jambumali's head was not there, nor his arms, nor his knees, nor his bow, nor his chariot and nor his horses were seen nor his arrows."
Sundara Kanda,44,16,"Thus struck by Hanuma, the mighty Jambumali, with his limbs and ornaments crushed to powder, was instantly killed and fell dead on the ground."
Sundara Kanda,44,17,"Hearing Jambumali having been killed, as also the mighty Kimkaras, Ravana was angry with his red enraged eyes."
Sundara Kanda,44,18,"Since the mighty son of Prahasta was killed, that Ravana rolling his red eyes with rage, immediately ordered the sons of ministers possessing high strength and prowess, to go to the battle."
Sundara Kanda,45,1,"Thereafter, those seven sons of his chief minister having a lustre similar to that of fire, surrounded by a great army, wielding their respective bows, possessing a great strength, well-trained in archery and the best among knower of weapons, wishing a victory reciprocally, having an immense prowess each, and as directed by Ravana, started highly delighted from that palace, in great chariots yoked with horses. Those chariots were having a noise similar to that of an autumnal cloud, overlaid with a protective armour of gold, surmounted by banners and decorated with smaller flags. They were stretching their bows inlaid with refined gold and looking colourful like clouds accompanied by flashes of lightning."
Sundara Kanda,45,2,Coming to know that Kimkaras themselves were killed their mothers together with their relatives and friends were tormented with grief.
Sundara Kanda,45,3,"Those sons of chief minister, wearing ornaments made of pure gold, rushed towards Hanuma, who was ready for battle and who stood on the archy gate-way motionless."
Sundara Kanda,45,4,"Those demons looking like clouds, diffusing thunder-like sounds of their chariots and discharging a shower of arrows, moved in different directions resembling rainy clouds in the monsoon."
Sundara Kanda,45,5,"Thus covered by those showers of arrows, Hanuma became invisible even as a mountain-king is concealed by incessant showers."
Sundara Kanda,45,6,"Roaming about in a cloudless sky, that fast-footed monkey made the arrows and the speedy chariots of those virile demons, useless."
Sundara Kanda,45,7,"Playing with those demons wielding a bow each in the sky, that hero shone like the Lord of Wind, playing with clouds brandishing a rain bow."
Sundara Kanda,45,8,"Making a terrific roar and frightening that great army, the valiant Hanuma rushed on those demons."
Sundara Kanda,45,9,"That Hanuma, the annihilator of enemies, struck some with his palms, some with his feet and some others with his fists. He tore down some others with his nails."
Sundara Kanda,45,10,"Hanuma crushed some with his chest and some others with his thighs. Some fell down there itself on the ground, just by the roar made by Hanuma."
Sundara Kanda,45,11,"Seeing those demons dying and falling on the ground, all the remaining army, afflicted with fear, fled in ten different directions."
Sundara Kanda,45,12,"Their elephants trumpeted with a wrong accent. Horses fell down on the ground. Even the earth was filled with chariots which had their seats, banners and canopies broken."
Sundara Kanda,45,13,"Thereafter, streams flowing with blood were seen on the way. Lanka resounded with various kinds of horrible voices."
Sundara Kanda,45,14,"That heroic and mighty Hanuma having a terrible prowess, killing those arrogant demons and being desirous of a combat with the other demons, again reached that archy door way itself."
Sundara Kanda,46,1,Coming to know that the chief minister's sons were killed by the high souled who had cleverly concealed the expression made an excellent thought.
Sundara Kanda,46,2,"That Ravana ordered (as follows) five foremost leaders of the army viz. Virupaksha, Yupaksha, Durdhara the demon, Praghasa and Bhasakarna, all of them brave demons, skilled in strategy, eager to capture Hanuma and equal to the speed of wind in battle."
Sundara Kanda,46,3,"He ordered as follows: ""March, all of you O generals, taking a large army together that mokey be punished."""
Sundara Kanda,46,4,"""Approaching that monkey, you ought to become diligent. Action should be taken by you which is not out of accord with time and space."""
Sundara Kanda,46,5,"""Judging him by his actions, I do not think him as a mere monkey. By all means, he may be an evil spirit, putting on an extraordinary might."""
Sundara Kanda,46,6,"""This evil spirit may be some being evolved for our sake by Indra the Lord of celestials with a strength of his askesis. Celestials, demons, sages along with Nagas the serpent-demons, Yakshas the spirits and Gandharvas the celestials musicians were conquered by my along with you all together. Even same offensive surely, will be effected to us by them. It is such an evil spirit created by Indra. There is no doubt about it. Let it be captured forcibly. This monkey of a great prowess should not be despised by you."""
Sundara Kanda,46,7,"""Earlier, I saw the monkeys of a great prowess like Vali and Sugreeva, the mighty Jambavan, Nila the Chief of army and so on like Dvivida. their scheme of performance is not so fearful as this; nor their efficacy, nor their prowess, nor their intellect, nor this capacity to change their form or energy at will."""
Sundara Kanda,46,8,"""Keeping in view that it is a great evil spirit standing in the form of a monkey, exert a great effort and capture it."""
Sundara Kanda,46,9,"""The three worlds including Indra, celestials, demons and humans are not fit to stand before you in the battle-field."""
Sundara Kanda,46,10,"""Even then, the one who is skilled in strategy, desirous of a victory in a battle is to protect himself. Victory in a battle is indeed unreliable."""
Sundara Kanda,46,11,"All of them, having a great strength and a blaze equal to that of fire, accepting the orders of their king and augmenting their strength with chariots, elephants in rut, horses of extra ordinary swiftness and various kinds of sharp weapons, sallied forth with a great speed."
Sundara Kanda,46,12,"Thereafter, those valiant demons saw that Hanuma the great monkey, encircled by his rays of splendour like a rising sun, shining, standing on the archy door-way, possessing enormous energy, strong mental disposition and colossal strength."
Sundara Kanda,46,13,"Immediately on seeing that Hanuma of great intellect, of great swiftness and of a gigantic body, all those demons, stationed in all quarters, attacked him with their terrific weapons from every side."
Sundara Kanda,46,14,Durdhara discharged five sharp and fierce steel arrows with a lustre of black lily-petals and yellow tops to descend into Hanuma's head.
Sundara Kanda,46,15,"Pierced in the head by those fire arrows, Hanuma leapt roaring in the sky, making the roar reverberating in all directions."
Sundara Kanda,46,16,"Then the mighty and the valiant Durdhara leapt into the sky with his chariot. Stretching his bow and throwing hundreds of sharp arrows, he attacked Hanuma."
Sundara Kanda,46,17,"Hanuma warded him off from showering the arrows on him in the sky, as the wind wards off a rainy cloud from raining at the end of a monsoon."
Sundara Kanda,46,18,"Thus afflicted by that Durdhara, Hanuma then emitted a roar once again and swiftly expanded his body."
Sundara Kanda,46,19,"Like a mass of lightning on a mountain, Hanuma instantaneously fell on Durdhara's chariot, by jumping up from far above with great speed."
Sundara Kanda,46,20,"Losing his chariot whose axle and pole had been broken and all his eight horses destroyed, Durdhara then dropped down, losing his life, to the ground."
Sundara Kanda,46,21,"Engrossed in anger to see his fallen on the ground, the inviolable virupaksha and Yupaksha, the annihilators of enemies, jumped up into the air."
Sundara Kanda,46,22,Jumping up in the air all of a sudden those two demons struck in the chest with their clubs that long-armed Hanuma standing in clear sky.
Sundara Kanda,46,23,"Striking down the swiftness of those violent demons, the mighty Hanuma whose prowess is equal to that of Garuda the eagle, again descended on to the ground."
Sundara Kanda,46,24,"Approaching a sala tree and uprooting it, that Hanuma the monkey killed those two valiant demons."
Sundara Kanda,46,25,"Getting to know all those mighty three killed by Hanuma, Praghasa with a great alacrity, forcefully attacked Hanuma. The valiant Bhasakarna, highly enraged, attacked taking a spear in his hand."
Sundara Kanda,46,26,The two generals stood by the side of the illustrious Hanuma. Praghasa pierced Hanuma with a sharp-pointed spear and Bhasakarna attacked him with a dart.
Sundara Kanda,46,27,"With his limbs wounded by those two demons, that Hanuma with his body-hair anointed by blood, became enraged, with his blaze similar to that of a rising sun."
Sundara Kanda,46,28,"Having plucked up the top of a mountain with its various animals serpents and trees, the heroic Hanuma the best among monkeys, killed those two demons."
Sundara Kanda,46,29,"When those five army-generals have been killed, Hanuma then destroyed that remaining army."
Sundara Kanda,46,30,"Like Indra the thousand-eyed god destroying the demons, Hanuma destroyed the horses by striking them with horses, the elephants with elephants, the warriors with warriors and the chariots with chariots."
Sundara Kanda,46,31,"The earth had its path-ways blocked on all sides with the elephants and the horses killed, with the demons killed and with the big chariots which had their axles broken."
Sundara Kanda,46,32,"Like Yama the Time-spirit waiting for the right moment for the destruction of the mortals, the heroic Hanuma, killing the eminent demons and the army-generals with their troops and vehicles in the combat, waited for the right moment at the arch-way."
Sundara Kanda,47,1,"Hearing and sustaining that the five army-generals along with their followers and vehicles were disposed off by Hanuma, Ravana looked at Aksha, his son, violent in combat and who was inclined to fighting as well as sitting in front of him."
Sundara Kanda,47,2,"Goaded by the looks of Ravana, the energetic Aksha, wielding a golden dotted bow, quickly sprang up, like a fire switched up by the foremost of brahmins in a sacrificial fire, by offering oblations to it."
Sundara Kanda,47,3,"Mounting a great chariot, having a splendour of a newly risen sun and overlaid with a protective armour of highly refined gold, that valiant cheif of demons sallied forth towards that mighty monkey."
Sundara Kanda,47,4,"Aksha's chariot was earned through many kinds of his penances. It was shining with a protective armour of highly refined gold, adorned with a flag on a flag-staff studded with gems and yoked well with eight excellent horses, having speed equal to that of a mind."
Sundara Kanda,47,5,"That chariot was unassailable by celestials or demons. It moved without hindrance to any place. It shone like a sun and could move within the sky. It was well-conceived with a quiver, eight swords and tied with bells. It was orderly arranged with spears and lances in their respective places."
Sundara Kanda,47,6,"Then, Aksha having a prowess equal to that of celestials, came forth, mounting that chariot decorated with golden wreaths, having a brilliance of moon and sun, filled with every right thing and shining like rays of sun."
Sundara Kanda,47,7,"Aksha, filling the sky earth and its mountains with sounds of horses elephants and chariots, together with his army, approached the efficient Hanuma the great monkey, standing at the archy door-way."
Sundara Kanda,47,8,"Approaching that Hanuma, standing there readily to destroy mortals, similar to a fire that is to destroy the world, the yellow-eyed Aksha was bewildered, born of a surprise and looked to him with a great esteem."
Sundara Kanda,47,9,"That Aksha, the mighty prince, assessing the swiftness of that high-souled Hanuma and his prowess with regard to his adversaries as also his own strength, increased his body more and more like the sun when the frost is faded away."
Sundara Kanda,47,10,"Understanding Hanuma's prowess to be unrestrainable and stable in battle, that Aksha, exhibiting anger initially, became stable and mentally composed and incited Hanuma to battle by discharging three sharp arrows towards him."
Sundara Kanda,47,11,"Recognizing that Hanuma, as a haughty monkey, after having gallantly conquered his adversaries and accustomed to fatigue, that Aksha, graspign the bow and arrows his hand, saw him with an excited mind."
Sundara Kanda,47,12,"Having a glden chain, a pair of armlets and charming ear-rings, Aksha of a swift prowess, approached Hanuma. Their unmatched get-together in combat became a baffle to even the celestials and demons."
Sundara Kanda,47,13,"Seeing that battle between Hanuma and Aksha, the earth uproared. The sun did not shine brightly. The wind ceased to blow. The mountain shook. The sky made a reverberant sound. The ocean too was agitated."
Sundara Kanda,47,14,"Then, that eminent demon, who correctly knew how to fix his gaze on the target, to fit an arrow to the bow and to discharge it, hurled on Hanuma's head, three arrows which were well-painted, having golden shafts and feathers and which resembled venomous serpants."
Sundara Kanda,47,15,"Oozing the blood from his wound caused by those arrows descended into his head (by Aksha), looking like the newly risen sun, his eyes bathed in blood rolling rapidly, Hanuma shone brightly like the sun surrounded by a circle of rays, having the arrows as its rays."
Sundara Kanda,47,16,"Seeing in the battle that Aksha the prince, with his marvellous weapons and picturesque bow, that Hanuma the excellent one among Sugree's counsellors, was rejoiced and with an inclination to fight, grew in size."
Sundara Kanda,47,17,"That Hanuma, endowed with strength and prowess, resembling the sun appearing on a peak of Mandara muntain and whose anger was increased, then burnt the prince Aksha along with his army and vehicles, by the rays of fire emnating from his eyes."
Sundara Kanda,47,18,"That demon in the form of a cloud, raining down arrows, then wielding a bow in the form of a rain-bow, soon discharged arrows on Hanuma standing in the form of a mountain, like a cloud showering rain on a high mountain."
Sundara Kanda,47,19,"Seeing that Aksha the prince, possessing an impetuous valour, endowed with enhanced splendour strength and vigour with a capacity to move within the sky like a cloud, coming to the battle, Hanuma roared with joy."
Sundara Kanda,47,20,"Boastful of his valour in battle because of his childish attitude, Aksha wit an enhanced fury and red-blood eyes, approached Hanuma who was incomparable in battle, as an elephant approaching a well covered with heaps of straw."
Sundara Kanda,47,21,"As Aksha forcefully discharged his arrows, Hanuma roared a sound of thunder and bounced quickly to the sky assuming a terrible sight, stretching out his arms and thighs."
Sundara Kanda,47,22,"That strong and valiant Aksha, the foremost among the demons, and the best among car warriors, went chasing Hanuma who was flying upwards, difusing arrows like a cloud showering hail-stones on a mountian."
Sundara Kanda,47,23,"That valiant Hanuma, whose swiftness was equal to the mind and possessing impetuous valour in battle, rushing forth like wind in the space between one arrow and another and thus escaping Aksha's arrows, moved in the path visited by wind (the sky)."
Sundara Kanda,47,24,"With a respectful faculty of sight, Hanuma saw that Aksha who was wielding his bow and readily inclined to fight, covering the entire sky with excellent arrows with various types of tops and became thoughful."
Sundara Kanda,47,25,"Then, the mighty armed Hanuma, who knew how to act under particular circumstances, roaring when pierced in the breast with shafts by the high souled heroic, Aksha, reflected on the prowess of his adversary in battle."
Sundara Kanda,47,26,"""The mighty Aksha, possessing the lustre of a rising sun, is performing a great act, as a mature youth. My mind is not conceding here to kill him, who is distinguished in all acts of war-fare."""
Sundara Kanda,47,27,"""He possesses a great intellect and is also prominent by his valour. He is well-composed and highly tolerant in battle. Due to his eminent deeds and virtues, he is undoubtedly adored by saints, Nagas the serpent-demons and Yakshas the semi-dviine being."""
Sundara Kanda,47,28,"""He is standing very much before me and looks me straight in the eyes, reassured as he is, by his prowess and enthusiasm. His swift-moving prowess trembles even the minds of celestials and demons."""
Sundara Kanda,47,29,"'If neglected, he would undoubtedly overpower me. His prowess is getting augmented in battle. The only option left out for me is to kill him now. It is not proper to neglect a spreadin fire."""
Sundara Kanda,47,30,"The valiant and te mighty Hanuma, reflecting thus about the swiftness of the adersary and determining his own couse of action, then acquired a course of action, then acquired a momentum and also made up his mind to kill him."
Sundara Kanda,47,31,"That Hanuma, the heroic son of wind, killed using the blows of his palm, those eight horses posessing a great speed in the path of sky with alertness as also having a capacity to bear burden while turning to different directions."
Sundara Kanda,47,32,"Then, the great chariot of Aksha, thus struck by the palm and subdued by Hanuma the counsellor of Sugreeva, had its interior broken, its carriage pole loosened and its horses dead and fallen from the sky to the ground."
Sundara Kanda,47,33,"Leaving the chariot, wielding the bow and sword, that Aksha the chariot-warrior leapt to the sky. Having a terrible power of penance and leaving his body like a sage, he then was seen departing to heaven because of his Yogic penance."
Sundara Kanda,47,34,"Thereafter, Hanuma with his prowess equal to that of wind, approaching Aksha moving in the sky, which is often frequented by Garuda the eagle, the wind and Siddhas the ascetics endowed with supernatural powers, slowly grasped his feet firmly."
Sundara Kanda,47,35,"That Hanuma, with a prowess equal to that of wind-god, his father, and the excellent one among monkeys, spigning round Aksha like grasping a great serpent an eagle for a thousand times in the battle, hurled him down to the floor rapidly."
Sundara Kanda,47,36,"With his arms, thighs, hips and neck broken, blood dripping, his bones and eyes crushed, his joints displaced and his sinews shattered, that demon was killed by Hanuma."
Sundara Kanda,47,37,"Hanuma, having crushed him on the ground, created a great fear to Ravana. Aksha, thus having been killed, Hanuma was gazed on with excessive astonishment by great sages who move everywhere without obstruction and having great voes as also by spirits Yakshas the semidivine beings, Pannagas the serpent-demons and by celestials with Indra the lord of celestials."
Sundara Kanda,47,38,"Killing that Aksha, possessing a lustre equal to that of Jayanta the son of Indra the lord of celestials and having his eyes resembling blood, the heroic Hanuma reached the same archy door way again, like Yama the lord of death expecting in a moment any mortal getting destroyed by him."
Sundara Kanda,48,1,"Filled with anger on his son Aksha having been killed by Hanuma, yet reconciling his mind, the high-minded Ravana the king of demons for his part then instructed Indrajit (his eldest son) possessing the qualities of god (as follows):"
Sundara Kanda,48,2,"""You are well acquainted with mystic missiles. You are the foremost among those who are conversant with weapons. You cause anguish even to celestials and demons. Indra and other celestials perceived your performance with your missiles acquired by propitiating Brahma the creator."""
Sundara Kanda,48,3,"""Celestials together with troops of storm-gods joining Indra the lord of celestials were not able to endure the strength of your missiles in battle."""
Sundara Kanda,48,4,"""In a battle against you, every one in the three worlds gets exhausted. You are protected yourself by your great intellect and strong arms. You are guarded by your penance. You are aware of apportioning place and time properly."""
Sundara Kanda,48,5,"""There is nothing impossible for you in your acts of war. With your purposeful thinking, everything is possible for you. There is none in the three worlds, who does not know the force of missiles as also your (physical) strength."""
Sundara Kanda,48,6,"""The strength of your penance as also your prowess and strength in battle resemble mine. Admitting you in the squeeze of battle, my mind does not get fatigues because of the re-assurance."""
Sundara Kanda,48,7,"""All the Kimkaras, a demon called Jambumali, the heroic sons of ministers and the five chiefs of army have been killed, as also the army together with highly abundant number of horses, elephants and chariots."""
Sundara Kanda,48,8,"""Your beloved brother Aksha the prince also has been killed. O annihilator of enemies! The strength which is in me or in you, is indeed not there in them at all."""
Sundara Kanda,48,9,"""O intelligent one! Seeing the great strength, power and prowess of this monkey and keeping in view your own strength, exhibit your valour accordingly."""
Sundara Kanda,48,10,"""Keeping in view your own strength and of the army, O the foremost among those employing missiles, exert yourself in such a way, that further destruction of our army may stop, the moment you, whose enemies have died, have arrived near Hanuma."""
Sundara Kanda,48,11,"""O hero! The armies cannot protect you, even if they are in multitudes. There is no use taking a weapon like a strong thunder bolt against the monkey. There is no limit to the strength of Hanuma the son of wind-god. It is not possible to kill him, who resembles fire, by means of any weapon."""
Sundara Kanda,48,12,"""Perceiving well the fact in this way and with your mind composed by the thought that success can be achieved by your own effort, and remembering the strength of arrows of your wonderful bow, go and duly proceed with your work, without any hindrance."""
Sundara Kanda,48,13,"""This thought of my sending you is not indeed the best option. But, this decision is said to be according to the duties of a king and is the commendation of a warrior-class."""
Sundara Kanda,48,14,"""O destroyer of enemies! You have to learn surely the skill to employ various weapons in battle. You have to aspire for a victory too in battle."""
Sundara Kanda,48,15,"Hearing the words of his father, Indrajit the strong demon, possessing a power similar to that of gods, with an undepressed mind and with his intellect resolved to fight, performed a circumambulation in honour of Ravana the lord."
Sundara Kanda,48,16,"Acclaimed by the beloved people of his own class, Indrajit who was violent in battle then entered the battle-field with an accomplished enthusiasm."
Sundara Kanda,48,17,"Indrajit, the illustrious son of Ravana, having eyes like lotus-petals and endowed with extra ordinary energy, rushed forth like an ocean on full-moon days."
Sundara Kanda,48,18,"That Indrajit, alike Indra the lord of celestials, ascended a chariot with unchecked speed and yoked with four sharp-toothed tigers, having their swiftness similar to Garuda the king of eagles."
Sundara Kanda,48,19,"That Indrajit, the chariot-warrior, best among the wielders of bow, skilled in the use of weapons and excellent among those proficient in the use of missiles, went swiftly in his chariot to where Hanuma was."
Sundara Kanda,48,20,"Hearing the rattling sound of Indrajit's chariot and a twang of his bow, the heroic Hanuma became more thrilled with delight."
Sundara Kanda,48,21,"Indrajit, skilled in warfare, taking a very big bow with pointed arrows, went aiming towards Hanuma."
Sundara Kanda,48,22,"While that Indrajit who was energetic in battle, was going ahead to the combat, with a bow in his hand, all the quarters became gloomy and ferocious animals howled in many ways."
Sundara Kanda,48,23,"Nagas and Yakshas, great sages moving in astronomical circles, Siddhas and a multitude of birds going around the sky, gathered there and clamoured loudly with a great rejoice."
Sundara Kanda,48,24,"Seeing Indrajit coming swiftly with the chariot, Hanuma made a noise with great resonance and grew up his body speedily."
Sundara Kanda,48,25,"Ascending on his wonderful chariot and wielding a colourful bow, Indrajit on his part, stretched his bow, which made a glaring sound like that accompanying a stroke lightning."
Sundara Kanda,48,26,"Those two warriors, Hanuma and Indrajit, possessing great velocity and a great strength as also fearless in combat, confronted in the battle like Indra the Lord of celestials and Ravana the Lord of demons who tightened hostility with each other."
Sundara Kanda,48,27,"Hanuma, of immeasurable strength, having expanded his body, aborted the swiftness of arrows of that Indrajit, the great chariot-warrior, the wielder of a bow and well-renowned in battle. Hanuma wheeled about in the path of wind-god, his father."
Sundara Kanda,48,28,"Then, the heroic Indrajit, the destroyer of strong enemies, discharged long and sharp-pointed arrows, having beautiful feathers, provided with picturesque golden shafts, with good inclination and as swift as lightning."
Sundara Kanda,48,29,"Hearing the rattling sound of the chariot and the sound of wooden tomtoms, kettledrums and war-drums as also the sound of the bow-string being plucked, Hanuma sprang up again."
Sundara Kanda,48,30,"Making the total target of Indrajit who was skilled in hitting his target useless, Hanuma the great monkey swiftly wheeled about between the arrows."
Sundara Kanda,48,31,"Hanuma, the son of wind-god, again stayed in front of his arrows and stretching out his hands, sprang up."
Sundara Kanda,48,32,"Those two warriors, full of swiftness and skilled in their war-fare, staged an excellent battle, which captivated the minds of all beings."
Sundara Kanda,48,33,"Indrajit could not know the weakness of Hanuma, nor did Hanuma know the weakness of high-minded Indrajit. Those two warriors, who were equal in prowess to gods, coming into collision with each other, became unbearable to each other."
Sundara Kanda,48,34,"The aim of his arrows getting aborted and even his unfailing arrows falling down, the high-minded Indrajit, who was well-known for hitting his target, got hold of a great thought."
Sundara Kanda,48,35,"Keeping in view of that monkey being incapable of being slain, Indrajit, Ravana's son then formed an idea as to how to resort to capture of that Hanuma the chief of monkey-warriors."
Sundara Kanda,48,36,"That warrior, Indrajit, excellent among the knowers of missiles and possessing a great splendor, then fitted to his bow, a missile presided over by Brahma the creator."
Sundara Kanda,48,37,"Indrajit, who knows the true nature of missiles, feeling certain that he was incapable of being killed, bound that Hanuma, the son of wind-god, by that presided over by Brahma the creator."
Sundara Kanda,48,38,"Fastened with the weapon discharged by the demon, Hanuma became motionless and fell down on the ground."
Sundara Kanda,48,39,"Realizing that he had been bound by a missile presided over by Brahma the Lord of creation that Hanuma failing to keep his swiftness, considered it to be a favour of Brahma the creator done to him."
Sundara Kanda,48,40,"Knowing it to be a missile presided over by Brahma the creator and consecrated by spells sacred to Brahma, the creator, Hanuma then recollected a boon got by Lord Brahma, the grand father of the entire creation."
Sundara Kanda,48,41,"""I have no capacity to liberate from the bondage of the missile due to the power of Brahma the father of the world. Thus knowing the bondage, through the missile presided over by Brahma the self-born creator imposed by the enemy, it must be obeyed by me."""
Sundara Kanda,48,42,"Thinking of the potency of the missile and the grace of Brahma, the grandfather of the entire creation enjoyed by him, and thinking about his capacity to liberate from it (which was going to alight on him after a while) that Hanuma obeyed the command of Brahma the grand father of the entire creation."
Sundara Kanda,48,43,"""Since I am being protected by Brahma, Indra and the wind-god, I do not have fear, eventhough I am fastened by the missile."""
Sundara Kanda,48,44,"""Even if I were captured by the demons, a great advantage is foreseen. There will be a dialogue with Ravana. Therefore, let the enemies capture me."""
Sundara Kanda,48,45,"That Hanuma, the destroyer of enemies and who acted after fully considering the pros and cons, ascertained his objective and stayed motionless. Approached and captured forcibly by the enemies as also frightened by them, he made a loud scream."
Sundara Kanda,48,46,"Seeing that Hanuma, the destroyer of enemies falling motionless, the demons then tied him with plaited chords of hemp and bark of trees."
Sundara Kanda,48,47,"Hanuma approved of being forcibly bound and reviled by the enemies, with an assured feeling that Ravana was curious as he was, to see him."
Sundara Kanda,48,48,"That powerful Hanuma, tied with those chords of hemp and bark, was relieved of the missile, since the bondage of that missile does not indeed coexist with another bondage."
Sundara Kanda,48,49,"Conceiving that Hanuma the foremost among the monkeys, bound with the bark of trees, as having been relieved of the missile, the heroic Indrajit, on his part, then became thoughtful as follows: ""A person tied with other means cannot indeed be bound again by the missile."""
Sundara Kanda,48,50,"""Alas! My great exploit has been rendered futile. The scope of the mystic formula has not been considered by the demons. Once the spell has been made ineffective, another missile cannot be operative. All of us became jeopardized."""
Sundara Kanda,48,51,"Hanuma, liberated from the missile being dragged away by the demons and afflicted by the ties of ropes, could not realize that he was liberated from the missile."
Sundara Kanda,48,52,"That Hanuma, then being beaten with sticks and fists by the cruel demons, was dragged to the vicinity of Ravana."
Sundara Kanda,48,53,"Then, recognizing that Hanuma, tied with barks of trees and ropes, but liberated by the missile, Indrajit slowed that mighty Hanuma the jewel among the monkeys, to Ravana there sitting along with a body of his attendants."
Sundara Kanda,48,54,"The demons showed to Ravana, the king of demons that captured Hanuma, the jewel among the foremost of monkeys who looked like an elephant in rut."
Sundara Kanda,48,55,"So went round the following conversations from the heroic demons there: ""Who is this being? Whose savant is he? Where has he come from? What is his pursuit? Who is his alley?"""
Sundara Kanda,48,56,"Thereafter, some demons, highly enraged, said to one another as follows: ""Let this monkey be killed, even roasted alive and devoured."""
Sundara Kanda,48,57,"After crossing over the path swiftly, the high-souled Hanuma saw there the palace of Ravana, decorated with highly precious stones and his elderly attendants sitting at the feet of Ravana."
Sundara Kanda,48,58,"That Ravana, who was endowed with an extraordinary energy, saw Hanuma the foremost of monkeys, being dragged hither and thither by demons of ugly countenance."
Sundara Kanda,48,59,"Hanuma the jewel among the monkeys also saw Ravana the king of demons, charged with luster and strength and blazing like the sun."
Sundara Kanda,48,60,"That Ravana, rolling his red-hot eyes with rage by seeing that Hanuma and thereafter seeing his important ministers who were elder to his by clan and character sitting there, ordered them to interrogate Hanuma."
Sundara Kanda,48,61,"Questioned, as per order, by those ministers as to the purpose of his operation and the motive of his act, that Hanuma at the outset informed, ""I came from Sugreeva as an envoy."""
Sundara Kanda,49,1,"Then, Hanuma with a terrific prowess, was enraged (at his capture and his being dragged) and saw Ravana with his red hot eyes. He was surprised by that deed of Indrajit."
Sundara Kanda,49,2,Ravana was endowed with a great splendor and shone with a glittering and precious diadem of gold as also encircled with strings of pearls.
Sundara Kanda,49,3,"That Ravana was adorned with bright-coloured gold ornaments, inlaid with diamonds and decorated with worthy gems, which appeared as though they were prepared with the mind."
Sundara Kanda,49,4,Ravana was attired in very costly silk and his body was smeared with red-sandal paste and well painted with various brightly coloured designs.
Sundara Kanda,49,5,"Ravana looked strange with his ten heads, having terrible-looking yet good-looking pair of red eyes each, with brilliant sharp enormous teeth and protruding lips, like a daring demon endowed with extra ordinary vigour, shining brightly as Mount Mandara with its peaks and infested with snakes of different varieties."
Sundara Kanda,49,6,"Ravana was having a pearl necklace casting its splendor on his bosom. He was looking like a mass of blue antimony, but with his countenance shining like the full moon and appearing like a cloud illumined by the rising sun."
Sundara Kanda,49,7,"Ravana was distinguished by (twenty) arms, adorned with bracelets, smeared with excellent sandal-paste and decked with shining Angadas another variety of bracelets and looking like large five-hooded serpents."
Sundara Kanda,49,8,"He was comfortably seated on a big excellent throne of crystal, rendered picturesque by being embedded with jewels and overspread with an exquisite covering."
Sundara Kanda,49,9,"He was duly waited upon at close quarters on all sides by young ladies, well-adorned and with whisks in their hands."
Sundara Kanda,49,10,"He was proud of his might and had four counselors sitting nearby, all belonging to the demonical race and who knew the secret of good counsel, viz. Durdhara, Prahasta, Mahaparshva the demon and the counselor Nikumbha and looked like the entire terrestrial globe enclosed by four oceans."
Sundara Kanda,49,11,"He was being reassured by counselors knowing the secret of good counsel and other demons with auspicious minds, as Indra the lord of celestials is reassured by celestials."
Sundara Kanda,49,12,"Hanuma saw Ravana with a great splendor, sitting on the throne, looking like a rainy cloud on the peak of Mount Meru."
Sundara Kanda,49,13,"Though tortured by the demons that Hanuma, of terrific prowess, experiencing a great surprise, looked attentively at Ravana."
Sundara Kanda,49,14,"Seeing the glittering Ravana, the king of demons, Hanuma was bewildered by his splendor and thought in his mind as follows:"
Sundara Kanda,49,15,"""What figure, what courage, what strength, what splendor and what amalgam of auspicious marks, alas, this king of demons has!"""
Sundara Kanda,49,16,"""Had this lord of demons perhaps not strong in unrighteousness, he would have been a protector of even the world of celestials together with Indra the lord of celestials."""
Sundara Kanda,49,17,"""By his cruel and violent acts despised by the world, all people including gods and demons indeed remain frightened of him. If enraged he is indeed capable to turn the entire world into a single ocean."""
Sundara Kanda,49,18,"Seeing the power of Ravana the king of demons, who possessed an unlimited vigour, the intelligent Hanuma formulated many kinds of thoughts in this way."
Sundara Kanda,50,1,"That Ravana, the long-armed, who caused people to cry, looking up at that monkey standing in front of him, was affected with violent anger, having his mind seized with suspicion, speculated (as follows) about Hanuma, the jewel among the monkeys, who was invested with splendour."
Sundara Kanda,50,2,"""When Mount Kailasa was moved by me, is it the same Nandi the divine bull (attendant of Siva) which cursed me long ago and came here now in this form or whether he is Bana the great demon (son of Bali) came here in the form of a monkey."""

Sundara Kanda,54,34,"Hanuma, with his great mind, saw Lanka with its dazed, frightened and dejected demons, marked by blazing flames of fire and afflicted by the fury of Brahma the creator of the universe."
Sundara Kanda,54,35,"After demolishing the garden which was full of excellent trees, killing great demons in battle and burning that city endowed with a series of excellent houses, Hanuma the monkey and the son of wind-god, stood at ease."
Sundara Kanda,54,36,"Standing there on the wonderful flat summit of Mount Trikuta, Hanuma the foremost leader of the monkeys, having a garland of flames formed by his blazing tail, shone like the sun having a garland of rays."
Sundara Kanda,54,37,"Killing those multitudes of demons, demolishing that garden endowed with several trees and scattering fire on the houses of demons, the high-souled Hanuma sought Rama with his mind."
Sundara Kanda,54,38,"Then, all the multitude of celestials enlogised that Hanuma, the principal warrior of the monkeys, possessing great strength and swiftness similar to the wind, greatly intelligent and the most excellent."
Sundara Kanda,54,39,"Demolishing the garden, killing the demons in battle, Hanuma of great splendour shone brightly, after burning the beautiful City of Lanka."
Sundara Kanda,54,40,"Seeing that city of Lanka burnt there, celestials, saints and great sages along with celestial's musicians, got a colossal surprise."
Sundara Kanda,54,41,"Seeing that Hanuma, the foremost among the monkeys and a mighty monkey, all the created beings were frightened, thinking of him as a fire that is to destroy the world."
Sundara Kanda,54,42,"There, all the celestial musicians, Vidyadharas the supernatural beings, Nagas the celestial serpents, Yakshas the spirits and all great living beings attained a great joy."
Sundara Kanda,55,1,"Seeing the city of Lanka blazing, and frightened with its multitude of demons getting alarmed, Hanuma the monkey became thoughtful."
Sundara Kanda,55,2,"A great anxiety entered his mind and there arose in him a feeling of self-contempt. He said to himself ""What an admonitory act has bee done by me in burning Lanka."""
Sundara Kanda,55,3,"""As a burning fire is extinguished with water, blessed indeed are those great-souled men of excellence, who in their wisdom, restrain their elevated fury."""
Sundara Kanda,55,4,"""Which enraged man would not incur a sinful act? An enraged person may even kill his elders. An enraged person may insult virtuous men with harsh words."""
Sundara Kanda,55,5,"""An agitated person ever does not know which appropriate words are and which are forbidden words to be uttered. For enraged persons, there is neither an improper act nor ever an improper word to be spoken."""
Sundara Kanda,55,6,"""As a serpent casts off its slough, whoever casts aside an intense anger sprung up in him suddenly by virtue of his endurance, he verily is said to be an excellent man."""
Sundara Kanda,55,7,"""Shame be upon me, the greatest sinner with utter foolishness and impudence, who became a fire-brand without giving thought to that Seetha and became hurtful to my master."""
Sundara Kanda,55,8,"""If this whole Lanka for its part has been burnt, the worshipful Seetha too has surely been burnt. Thus, I have spolt the purpose of my lord inadvertently."""
Sundara Kanda,55,9,"""That purpose for which all this effort was taken, has been spoilt. At the time of burning the city, I have not saved Seetha indeed."""
Sundara Kanda,55,10,"""This task (of burning Lanka) has been fulfilled by me and it has been completed only with a small effort. Overpowered as I was with anger, the very root of that fulfillment has been destroyed by me. There is no doubt."""
Sundara Kanda,55,11,"""The entire Lanka has been reduced to ashes. No place is seen unburnt in this City. Therefore, Seetha also must have been surely lost."""
Sundara Kanda,55,12,"""If this task has been spoiled due to my perverted intelligence, it is appropriate even for me, here and now itself, to give up my life."""
Sundara Kanda,55,13,"""Shall I jump into fire now or into the mouth of a submarine fire? Or shall I give up my body as a feed to the marine animals?"""
Sundara Kanda,55,14,"""By me who has ruined the entire task, how can I, even while remaining alive, see Sugreeva the Lord of monkeys or Rama and Lakshmana the best of men?"""
Sundara Kanda,55,15,"""Due to culpability of my anger, I have indeed shown this apishness that is famous for instability in the three worlds."""
Sundara Kanda,55,16,"""Let there be shame upon the passionate way of my thinking, which breeds helplessness and instability. fir, eventhough capable as I am, Seetha could not be saved by me due to my exciting passion of anger."""
Sundara Kanda,55,17,"""If Seetha dies, those two princes, Rama and Lakshmana will die. If their death occurs, Sugreeva along with his associates will also die."""
Sundara Kanda,55,18,"""How can the virtuous Bharata together with Shatrughna, who are affectionate to his brother, survive after hearing this news?"""
Sundara Kanda,55,19,"""When the virtuous Ikshvaku dynasty perishes, all the people will undoubtedly be tormented with anguish and affliction."""
Sundara Kanda,55,20,"""Therefore, I, the unfortunate being, deprived of the values of duty and interest, with my mind filled with culpability of anger, clearly became the destroyer of the world."""
Sundara Kanda,55,21,"While thinking thus, Hanuma clearly saw some omens, whose welcome-results had already been directly experienced by him and again thought (as follows);"
Sundara Kanda,55,22,"""Or else, Seetha the auspicious lady, who is completely charming of her limbs and protected by her own effulgence, does not get destroyed. Fire does not indeed destroy fire!"""
Sundara Kanda,55,23,"""If this fire with its burning nature is not igniting me, it is surely due to the power of Rama and the benevolence of Seetha."""
Sundara Kanda,55,24,"""How should that Seetha, who is a godhead for the three brothers (of Rama) starting with Bharata and who is dear to the heart of Rama perish?"""
Sundara Kanda,55,25,"""This fire, which spreads everywhere without any hindrance, is not burning my tail. How can it burn the venerable Seetha?"""
Sundara Kanda,55,26,Hanuma then recalled with wonder the sight of Mount Mainaka (having gold in its cavities) in the midst of sea-water there.
Sundara Kanda,55,27,"""That Seetha can even burn away the fire by her penance, true utterances and undivided devotion towards her husband. Fire does not ignite her."""
Sundara Kanda,55,28,"Hanuma, who was thus thinking there about the overpowering virtue of Seetha, happened to hear the words of the high-souled charanas (heavenly bards)."
Sundara Kanda,55,29,"""Alas! Hanuma, who hurled a very terrific fire into Ravana's house, has indeed done a difficult act."""
Sundara Kanda,55,30,"""The city of Lanka, full of demons their wives, children and elders running hither and thither, as also filled with an uproar of people, appears as if it weeping through its mountain-caves."""
Sundara Kanda,55,31,"""It is just so surprising a marvel to us that the entire City with its market-places, ramparts and arched door-ways, was burnt, but Seetha alone was not burnt."""
Sundara Kanda,55,32,"That Hanuma became delighted in his mind, by seeing the omens, with their apparent advantages in them and very high qualities of their origin as also the words of those sages."
Sundara Kanda,55,33,"Then, Hanuma, having fulfilled his object of desire by learning that Seetha the princess remains uninjured, made up his mind to return only after seeing her personally yet again."
Sundara Kanda,56,1,"Thereafter, having offered his salutation to Seetha, who was present at the foot of Ashoka tree, Hanuma spoke: ""Thank heaven! I am seeing you uninjured here!"""
Sundara Kanda,56,2,"Then, beholding again and again, that Hanuma, who had made ready for his return journey, Seetha spoke the following words, filled with affection towards her husband."
Sundara Kanda,56,3,"""O Hanuma, the annihilator of enemies! You are yourself surely sufficient single-handed completion of this task. Your elevated energy is creditable indeed."
Sundara Kanda,56,4,"""But, it will be appropriate for Rama, who destroys the hostile forces, to take me with him, after routing Lanka with his arrows."""
Sundara Kanda,56,5,"""Therefore, you act in such a way that the high-souled Rama, valiant in battle, may exhibit prowess worthy of him."""
Sundara Kanda,56,6,"Hearing those humble, reasonable and meaningful words of Seetha, Hanuma spoke the following words in reply."
Sundara Kanda,56,7,"""Rama, accompanied by the leaders of monkeys and bears, will come soon and after conquering the enemies in battle, will take away your grief."""
Sundara Kanda,56,8,"Hanuma, the son of wind-god, thus consoling Seetha and making up his mind to go, saluted Seetha with reverence."
Sundara Kanda,56,9,"Thereafter, that Hanuma the foremost among the monkeys, and the annihilator of enemies, with an anxious desire to see his lord, ascended the Mount Arishta of excellence."
Sundara Kanda,56,10,"That mountain was covered as it were with dark green rows of gardens inhabited by towery elephants with red spots on their skin and with its clouds hanging between its summits, as with an upper garment."
Sundara Kanda,56,11,"By metals scattered here and there, looking like eyes drawing up the eye-lids, the mountain looked like being awakened, as it were, with love by the bright rays of the sun."
Sundara Kanda,56,12,"The mountain looked resembling the one which has started reciting the scriptures clearly in the form of the deep sound of running streams of water, singing as it were at a high pitch, in the form of roaring sound of various cascades."
Sundara Kanda,56,13,"The mountain stood as it were with uplifted arms in the form of very lofty deodars and which started crying loudly as it were, on all sides, in the form of the sound of its cascades."
Sundara Kanda,56,14,"The mountain seemed to be trembling in the form of waving dark automnal groves, which was piping as it were, in the form of hollow bamboos shaken up by the wind and whistling."
Sundara Kanda,56,15,"The mountain was hissing as it were with fury, in the form of its terrible and most poisonous snakes and which sat absorbed in meditation as it were, in the form of its deep caves covered with mist."
Sundara Kanda,56,16,"The mountain seems to be setting out on a journey on all four sides, with feet of the mountain, looking like rising clouds, which with its peaks having a lining of clouds, seemed to stretch its limbs in the sky."
Sundara Kanda,56,17,"The mountain was embellished with a number of summits and adorned with numerous caves scattered at many places and endowed with many sal, palmyrah, karna and bamboo trees."
Sundara Kanda,56,18,"The mountain was adorned with clusters of creepers having plenty of flowers, filled with a number of summits and adorned with numerous caves scattered at many places and endowed with many sal, palmyrah, karna and bamboo trees."
Sundara Kanda,56,19,"The mountain was endowed with many cascades, crowded together with heaps of rocks and frequented by great sages, Yakshas, Gandharvas, Kinnaras and celestial serpents."
Sundara Kanda,56,20,"The mountain was exquisite with creepers and trees, having caves inhabited by lions, spread over with a number of tigers and endowed with sweet roots and fruit-trees."
Sundara Kanda,56,21,"Hanuma, the son of wind-god, in a hurry to see Rama, ascended that mountain, excited as he was with an extreme joy."
Sundara Kanda,56,22,"Then, the rocks in the charming table-land of the mountain, on which the soles of Hanuma lied heavily, were crushed with noise and fallen to pieces."
Sundara Kanda,56,23,"Desirous of reaching the northern shore from the southern shore of that ocean, Hanuma ascended that mountain and enlarged his body."
Sundara Kanda,56,24,"Then, the valiant Hanuma after ascending the mountain, saw the terrific ocean inhabited by fishes and water-snakes."
Sundara Kanda,56,25,"Hanuma, the foremost among the monkeys and the son of the wind-god, entered the sky towards northern direction, like a wind, from southern direction."
Sundara Kanda,56,26,"Pressed at that moment by Hanuma, that excellent mountain sank into the bowels of the earth along with the various living beings and made a noise with its shaking summits and toppling trees."
Sundara Kanda,56,27,"Shaken by the impetus of the thighs of Hanuma, trees in blossom were broken and fell down on earth, as though struck by a thunder-bolt."
Sundara Kanda,56,28,"When the lions of great prowess dwelling in the midst of caves were tormented and roared terribly, that roaring noise was heard as it was piercing the sky."
Sundara Kanda,56,29,"The females of Vidyadhara class of supernatural beings, with their raiments in disorder through fear and their ornaments fallen off, went up all of a sudden from the mountain."
Sundara Kanda,56,30,"Large poisonous serpents of immense size, possessing vigour and having fiery tongues with their hoods and necks severely pressed lay coiled."
Sundara Kanda,56,31,"Then, leaving that tormented mountain of excellence; Kinnaras, Nagas, Gadharvas, Yakshas and Vidyadharas ascended to the sky."
Sundara Kanda,56,32,"Pressed down by that strong Hanuma, that beautiful mountain having its elevated summits crowned with trees, entered the bowels of the earth."
Sundara Kanda,56,33,"That mountain, with a width of ten yojanas (or eighty miles) and a height of thirty yojanas (or two hundred and forty miles) got level with the earth."
Sundara Kanda,56,34,"With a desire to cross easily the terrific ocean, whose shores were being lashed by its waves, which Hanuma jumped up into the air."
Sundara Kanda,57,1,"Hanuma, with a rush equal to that of wind, withaut a fatigue, leapt across the baundless sea looking analogaus to sky, like a large ship crossing the ocean. In that pleasant and auspiciaus sky-like sea, shone the moon as a white water-like sea, shone having the constellations known by the names of Pushya and Shravana as swans, the clauds as its duck-weeds; the twin constellations the Punarvasus as its large fish, the planet Mars as its large alligator, a large island as Airavata (Indra's elephant), graced with a swan in the form of the constellation, Shwati, having gales as its waves, the moon bea.ns as its cool water and with the Nagas, yakshas and Gandharvas as its full blown lotuses and water-lilies."
Sundara Kanda,57,2,"While moving in the sky, the illustrious Hanuma, the son of wind-god and the great monkey, appeared as if swallowing the sky, scratching the moon and carrying off the sky with its stars and the disc of the sun and was going as though dragging asunder, a mass of clouds."
Sundara Kanda,57,3,"Dense clauds, with white and red colaurs, blue and yellow colaurs as also green and reddish brown colaurs shone brightly in the sky."
Sundara Kanda,57,4,"Time and again, entering and coming out of the clusters of clouds, Hanuma appeared like the moon becoming visible and invisible again and again."
Sundara Kanda,57,5,"The heroic Hanuma, who was clad in white clothes, having faund his way into variaus kinds of dense clauds (and energing again) and having his personlaity becoming visible and invisible, shone like the moon in the sky."
Sundara Kanda,57,6,"Tearing asunder the clusters of clouds again and again as also energing from them and roaring with a big noise, Hanuma the son of wind-god, making a thunderous great sound, shone flying like Garuda the eagle, in the sky."
Sundara Kanda,57,7,"Killing the foremost of demons, becoming famaus by is name, making Lanka perplexed, causing anguish to Ravana by tormenting his terrible army, and bidding his adieu to Sheetha, Hanuma returned by flying over the middle of the sea."
Sundara Kanda,57,8,"Touching Mount Mainaka, the victorious Hanuma came with a great speed resembling an iron arrow discharged from a bow-string."
Sundara Kanda,57,9,"Approaching a bit near and observing Maunt Mahendra, the great mauntain looking like a dense claud, that Hanuma made a laud noise."
Sundara Kanda,57,10,"Emitting a great roar, that Hanuma, whole loud noise resembled the rumbling of a cloud, filled the whole space in all directions with the noise."
Sundara Kanda,57,11,"Having reached that place, Hanuma who was ardently desiraus of seeing his friends, roared and waved his tail."
Sundara Kanda,57,12,"The sky, with the disc of the sun, began to crack as it were, due to his roar, even as he repeatedly roared on the path of the sky as followed by Garuda, the eagle endowed with charming wings."
Sundara Kanda,57,13,"Those mighty heroes who were waiting already on the northern shore of the sea, with an eagerness to see Hanuma, heard there at that time, the saund produced by the sweeping motion of Hanuma's thighs, which resembled the reoar of a huge claud propelled by the wind."
Sundara Kanda,57,14,"All those monkeys, who were distressed in mind (for not having heard the news of Seetha hitherto), heard Hanuma's roar similar to the roar of a rumbling cloud."
Sundara Kanda,57,15,"Hearing that roar of Hanuma, who was making the saund, all those mokeys stationed there in all directions, became anxiausly desiraus of seeing their friend."
Sundara Kanda,57,16,"The Jambavan, the foremot among the monkesy and bears, with his mind thrilled with joy, having summoned all the monkeys, spoke the follwoing words:"
Sundara Kanda,57,17,"""This Hanuma has accoMplished his assignment in all ways. His saund will not indeed be like this, if he has not fulfilled his task. There is not daubt in this matter."""
Sundara Kanda,57,18,"Hearing the sound of the dashing movement of the high souled Hanuma's arms and thighs, the monkeys moved by jumps with joy from their respective places."
Sundara Kanda,57,19,"Those monkeys with joy, longing to see Hanuma, took off from the top of one tree to the tops of other trees as also from one mauntain-summit to the other summits."
Sundara Kanda,57,20,"Those monkeys, grasping the boughs at the tops of trees, and standing there firmly, joyously waved the twigs, as if they are their raiments."
Sundara Kanda,57,21,"The mighty, Hanuma the son of wind-god, roared as thaugh the wind roars while it enters the caves of mauntains."
Sundara Kanda,57,22,"Seeing that Hanuma then rushing like a dense cloud, all those monkeys stood there, joining their palms in salutation."
Sundara Kanda,57,23,"The swift Hanuma, looking like a mauntain, then descended on the summit of that Maunt mahendra, thick with trees."
Sundara Kanda,57,24,"Hanuma like a mountain with its wings torn off, thrilled with joy, fell from the sky into a charming mountain-torrent."
Sundara Kanda,57,25,"Then, all the foremost of those monkeys, with their pleasing hearts, stood surraunding the high-sauled Hanuma. Having encircled Hanuma, all of them obtained a supreme joy."
Sundara Kanda,57,26,"All those mokeys with their delightful faces, taking roots and fruits as their presents, honured Hanuma, the foremost among the monkeys, who came back hale and healthy."
Sundara Kanda,57,27,"Then, Hanuma the excellent one among the monkeys, on his part, offered his salutation to venerable persons and elders like Jambavan in the first place, as also Angada, the prince."
Sundara Kanda,57,28,Jambavan and Angada honoured that victorious and venerable Hanuma. The other monkeys also made him gracious. Hanuma informed them briefly that he had seen Seetha.
Sundara Kanda,57,29,"Then, seizing the hand of Angada, Vali's son, Hanuma sat down at a distinct spot in the charming forest of Maunt Mahendra."
Sundara Kanda,57,30,"Then, the pleased Hanuma spoke the following words to those excellent monkeys: ""I saw that Seetha, the duaghter of Janaka, who was staying in Ashoka garden, guarded unblemished by highly dreadful female-demons and wearing a single braid, young woman, as she was, longing to see Rama, thoroughly fatigued due to her fasting, with her hair twisted together, wearing soiled clothes and looking emaciated."""
Sundara Kanda,57,31,Hearing from Hanuma that iMportant and nectar like word to the effect that Sheetha had been seen all the monkeys became delighted.
Sundara Kanda,57,32,Some mighty monkeys made a lion's roar. Some were making a sound of approbation. Some were making a sound of thunder. Some others proudced cries expressing joy. Some others were roaring in return.
Sundara Kanda,57,33,"Shome eminent monkeys, with joy and with their tails lifted up, waved their distended curved tails."
Sundara Kanda,57,34,"Descending from the mountain-tops; some other monkeys, with delight, fondingly touched Hanuma who resembled an elephant."
Sundara Kanda,57,35,"After hearing the words of Hanuma, Angada spoke the follwoing excellent words in the midst of those eminent monkeys."
Sundara Kanda,57,36,"""O Hanuma! Since you returned here crossing the extensive ocean, none stands equal to you in strength and prowess."""
Sundara Kanda,57,37,"""What amazing is yaur devotion to the Lord! What a wonderful prowess! What a surprising caurage! By aur good fortune, yau saw the illustriaus Sheetha, Rama's consort. Thank heaven! Rama can give up his sorrow born aut of Sheetha's separataion."""
Sundara Kanda,57,38,"Very much delighted, the monkeys then sat on extensive flat rocks encircling Angada, Hanuma and Jambavan."
Sundara Kanda,57,39,"Longing to hear abaut crossing of ocean and the seeing of Lanka, Sheetha and Ravana, all those excellent monkeys waited with their joined pal.ns, in anctipation of Hanuma's words."
Sundara Kanda,57,40,"The auspicious Angada encircled by many monkeys there, waited like Indra the lord of celestials, who was waited upon by celestials in heaven."
Sundara Kanda,57,41,"The high and large summit of the mauntain, on which were seated then with delight, the illustriaus Hanuma and the famaus Angada, with bracelets worn on his upper ar.ns, stood blazed with splendaur."
Sundara Kanda,58,1,"Thereafter, the mighty monkeys, headed by Hanuma and others, experienced a great joy on that summit of Mount Mahendra."
Sundara Kanda,58,2,"Then, Jambavan, thrilling with rapture, asked the delighted Hanuma, the great monkey about the particulars of that actual occurrence (of seeing Seetha) as follows"
Sundara Kanda,58,3,"""How did you see Seetha? How was she there? How was that Ravana of terrible deeds behaving towards her?"""
Sundara Kanda,58,4,"""O Hanuma! Tell us entirely, in truth whatever has occurred. Ascertaining the truth, from you, we shall again think about what decision to be taken further."""
Sundara Kanda,58,5,"""When we go there (to the presence of Rama), having prudence, tell us clearly which matter is to be disclosed and which matter is to be kept off from him."""
Sundara Kanda,58,6,"Thus commanded by Jambavan, Hanuma, with his hair standing on end mentally offered his salutation to Seetha, the princess, by bowing his head and replied as follows:"
Sundara Kanda,58,7,"""With an intention to reach the southern shore of the ocean, I leapt into the sky, indeed before your presence, from the summit of Mount Mahendra."""
Sundara Kanda,58,8,"""While I was going, a terrific hindrance occurred in my way as it was. I saw a golden mountain-peak which was so charming and fascinating."""
Sundara Kanda,58,9,"""I accounted that mountain staying turned towards the path, as an impediment. Approaching that excellent charming and golden mountain, I made up my mind to shatter it."""
Sundara Kanda,58,10,"""As I struck it with my tail, the mountain-peak of that great hill, resembling the sun, was broken into a thousand pieces."""
Sundara Kanda,58,11,"""Understanding my purpose, that great mountain spoke the following sweet words saying, 'O my son!', As though it was refreshing my mind (once more to proceed further)."""
Sundara Kanda,58,12,""" 'Know me to be generally called as Mynaa dwelling in this great ocean, as a companion of the wind-god and even as your father's brother'."""
Sundara Kanda,58,13,""" 'O my son! Long ago, the foremost among the mountains used to have wings. They used to wander the entire earth freely, hurting the people!"""

Sundara Kanda,58,16,""" 'O Hanuma the annihilator of enemies! I have to behave in such a way as to help Rama. For, Rama, having a prowess equal to that of Indra; is indeed excellent in supporting righteousness.'"""
Sundara Kanda,58,17,"""Hearing the words of that high-souled Mynaka and after informing my purpose, my mind was prepared for a further travel. The high-soled Mynaka also allowed me to depart."""
Sundara Kanda,58,18,"""That Mynaka mountain vanished in the guise of a beautiful form of a human being. That large mountainous form also later drowned into the great ocean."""
Sundara Kanda,58,19,"""Thereafter, employing an excellent speed and continuing on my course, I proceeded in that path speedily for a long time."""
Sundara Kanda,58,20,"""Thereafter, I saw Surasa, the mother of serpents in the midst of the sea. That goddess spoke the following words to me."

Sundara Kanda,58,22,"""Hearing Surasa's words, I stood there, offering salutation with my joined palms to her. Becoming pale-faced, I spoke the following words:"

Sundara Kanda,58,27,"""Hearing the words of Surasa, I, as tall as ten Yojanas (eighty miles), within a moment, grew half as much in size (fifteen Yojanas or one hundred twenty miles)."""
Sundara Kanda,58,28,"""She opened her mouth so wide as to correspond to the size of my body. Seeing her expanded mouth, I assumed a dwarfish form. At that moment, I still became reduced to the size of a human thumb."""
Sundara Kanda,58,29,"""After entering her mouth quickly, I then came out instantly. The divine Surasa, in her native form, spoke to me again, as follows:"

Sundara Kanda,58,31,"""Then, all living beings praised me! Saying Good! Well done! Bravo! Thereupon, I leapt into the extensive sky, like Garuda the eagle, the carrier of Lord Vishnu."""
Sundara Kanda,58,32,"""In the meanwhile, my shadow was held fast. Yet, I did not perceive anything. My speed having been blocked, I surveyed all the ten directions. But I could not discover there, any object by which my movement was blocked."""
Sundara Kanda,58,33,"""Then, the thought arose in me: ""How I wonder has such a hindrance arose in my journey, although no concrete configuration is being seen here?"""
Sundara Kanda,58,34,"""While I was thinking thus, my sight has fallen downward. There, I saw a terrible female-demon lying in water."""

Sundara Kanda,62,1,"Hanuma, like a bull among the monkeys and the foremost among them spoke to them as follows: ""Cherish the honey with a cool mind, O monkeys! I will keep off your opposer who is standing in your way."""
Sundara Kanda,62,2,"Hearing the words of Hanuma, the gracious minded Angada the principal among the monkeys repeated the words: ""Let the monkeys drink the honey."""

Sundara Kanda,62,4,"Hearing the words coming from the mouth of Angada, those monkeys who were like bulls among the monkeys were delighted and answered with reverence, saying 'good, good!'"
Sundara Kanda,62,5,"Reverencing Angada the foremost among the monkeys, all the monkeys rushed towards Madhuvana, the grove abounding in honey, like the rush of a river towards a tree."
Sundara Kanda,62,6,"Because Hanuma had seen Seetha and others had heard of her and because of the grant of permission from Angada, all those gifted monkeys entered Madhuvana the grove, overpowered the guards with their prowess, drank honey and the partook juicy fruits there."
Sundara Kanda,62,7,"Then, all those monkeys jumped on the guards of the grove, who came there in hundreds together and banged them."
Sundara Kanda,62,8,All those monkeys together took vessels of honey in their arms and drank them. Some others banged those who obstructed them.
Sundara Kanda,62,9,"Some monkeys, with their skin-colour as yellow as honey, after drinking vessels of honey, also threw some honey away. Some others, with the remnant of honey in their arms, after drinking, whipped up one another with their excessive intoxication."
Sundara Kanda,62,10,"Some others, seizing a branch of a tree, stood rooted at the foot of a tree. Some, who were highly intoxicated, laid down spreading leaves on the ground."
Sundara Kanda,62,11,"Those monkeys, who were intoxicated by drinking the honey, became inebriated and started pushing one another cheerfully and some others began to stumble."
Sundara Kanda,62,12,"Some were roaring like lions. Some, with joy, whistled like birds. Some monkeys, inebriated as they were by drinking honey, simply slept on the floor."
Sundara Kanda,62,13,"Doing something or other, some were laughing. Some others were doing something else. Some were telling what they were doing, while some others were understanding some things else."
Sundara Kanda,62,14,"The honey-keepers, who were there as messengers of Dadhimukha in that Madhuvana, were warded off by the terrific monkeys and they fled to different directions."
Sundara Kanda,62,15,"Dragged by their knees and tossed up in the air by the monkeys, those honey-keepers were very much depressed, went to Dadhimukha and complained as follows:"

Sundara Kanda,62,19,"Hearing these words of Dadhimukha, the foremost of those monkeys who displayed their heroism, quickly went again to madhuvana along with him."
Sundara Kanda,62,20,"Grasping a tree, Dadhimukha speedily took up his position in the middle of those monkeys in Madhuvana. All his follower-monkeys also ran with him."
Sundara Kanda,62,21,"Those enraged monkeys, taking rocks, trees and even mountains, went to the place wehre those foremost of monkeys were there."
Sundara Kanda,62,22,"Those heroic monkeys, keeping the words of their master in mind, briskly ran with Sala trees, palm trees and rocks as their weapons."
Sundara Kanda,62,23,"Then, the valiant guards of the grove running in thousands invaded the monkeys who were on trees, at the foot of the trees and who were arrogant of their strength."
Sundara Kanda,62,24,"Seeing Dadhimukha coming with anger, Hanuma along with eminent monkeys ran towards him with speed."
Sundara Kanda,62,25,"The enraged Angada struck there with his arms, that long-armed Dadhimukha the maternal uncle his father, who was endowed with extraordinary might and who was rushing with speed with a tree in his hand."
Sundara Kanda,62,26,"Blinded with arrogance, that Angada did not show any mercy to him on the score of his being the maternal uncle of his father and caused him at once to fall down and began to crush him against the ground."

Sundara Kanda,62,36,"That Dadhimukha, the monkey, reached the place where that Sugreeva, the intelligent monkey was there, within an interval of only a moment."
Sundara Kanda,62,37,"Seeing Rama, Lakshmana and Sugreeva, Dadhimukha descended to a level ground, from the sky."
Sundara Kanda,62,38,"That Dadhimukha of a great prowess, the supreme lord of the guards, surrounded by all those garden-guards keeping a sad face, made a respectful salutation to Sugreeva with his head, by falling down and touching with his head, the auspicious feet of Sugreeva."
Sundara Kanda,63,1,"Just on seeing Dadhimukha, who fell touching his feet with his head, Sugreeva the chief of monkeys, with an agitated mind, spoke the following words:"

Yuddha Kanda,4,59,"Some monkeys lashed their tails. Some even stamped their feet. Some others, stretching their arms, broke off rocks and trees."
Yuddha Kanda,4,60,Some monkeys ascended mountain-peaks and uttered huge noises. Some others made lion's roars.
Yuddha Kanda,4,61,"Some monkeys were crushing many webs of creepers by the jerks of their thighs. The valiant monkeys also played with rocks and trees, by stretching their limbs."
Yuddha Kanda,4,62,"In that place, the land was covered splendidly by hundreds of thousands, by thousands and crores of monkeys, who were looking very dreadful."
Yuddha Kanda,4,63,"That extensive monkey-army was marching day and night. All the monkeys ruled by Sugreeva were exceedingly pleased and cheerful. All were marching quickly, rejoicing for war. Those monkeys desirous of Seetha's release, did not halt even for a moment anywhere."
Yuddha Kanda,4,64,"Then, those monkeys reached and climbed up a mountain called sahya with a full canopy of trees and filled with many kinds of beasts."
Yuddha Kanda,4,65,"Rama too went along, seeing the wonderful woods, streams and cascades of Sahya and Malaya mountains."
Yuddha Kanda,4,66,"The monkeys enjoyed the fruits of Champaka, Tilaka, mango, Praseka, Sindnvaara Timisa and Karaveera trees."
Yuddha Kanda,4,67,"The monkeys enjoyed Ashoka, Karanja, Plaksa, Nyagrodha, Jambu, myrobalan and Naga trees."
Yuddha Kanda,4,68,"Various kinds of forest-trees standing on enchanting plateaus, being shaken by gust of winds, poured out flowers on those monkeys."
Yuddha Kanda,4,69,"A soft-touching breeze, refreshing as a sandal, blew while the bees hummed in the nectar-scented woods."
Yuddha Kanda,4,70,"That royal Sahya Mountain was highly adorned with red-coloured metal. The dust blown from that metal by the velocity of wind, coming forth from all sides, obscured the huge monkey-army."
Yuddha Kanda,4,71,"On the lovely mountain slopes, in blossom on all sides, Ketaki and Sindhuvara trees, the charming Vasanti, Madhavi creepers with flowers full of scent, clumps of jasmine, Chiribila, Madhuka, Vanjula and Vakula, Ranjanka and Tilaka, Nyavriksha all in flower, Mango, Patalike, Kovidara in flower, Muchulinda, Arjuna, Simsapa and Kutaja, Hintala, Timisa, Chirna and Nipa, blue Ashoka, Sarala, Ankola and Padmaka all these trees were crawled in excitement by the monkeys who were delighted."
Yuddha Kanda,4,72,"There were delightful wells with stairs and ponds in that mountain, sought after by chakravaka birds, frequented by karandava birds, crowded with water-fowls and cranes, visited by boars and deer, haunted on all sides by bears, hyenas, lions and many dreadful tigers. There were beautiful reservoirs of water with blossoming blue lotuses, water lilies, white water lilies, black water lilies and various other kinds of aquatic flowers."
Yuddha Kanda,4,73,"Various kinds of birds sang in those mountain-peaks. Monkeys bathed in water, drank those waters and played. They ascended the mountain and got drenched in water, by sprinkling water by one over the other among themselves."
Yuddha Kanda,4,74,"Monkeys in mad rut plucked sweet-smelling fruits, roots and flowers there."
Yuddha Kanda,4,75,"Those monkeys, in reddish brown colour like honey, drinking honey from honey-combs weighing about a maund each, went on cheerfully."
Yuddha Kanda,4,76,"Those foremost among the monkeys marched, breaking off trees, pulling along creepers and throwing away excellent mountains."
Yuddha Kanda,4,77,"Some other monkeys, well-pleased with honey got from trees, yelled loudly. Some others reached trees to get honey. Some others were drinking honey excessively."
Yuddha Kanda,4,78,"The earth filled with those excellent monkeys, was like land filled with ripened fields of paddy."
Yuddha Kanda,4,79,"Then, the lotus-eyed and the mighty-armed Rama reached Mahendra mountain and ascended its top, adorned with trees."
Yuddha Kanda,4,80,"Then, Rama the son of Dasartha mounted the peak and saw an ocean ruffled with water and scattered well with turtles and fishes."
Yuddha Kanda,4,81,They crossed Sahya mountain and Malaya mountain and systematically approached the ocean having terrific sound.
Yuddha Kanda,4,82,"Rama the foremost of those who entrance the mind, together with Sugreeva and Lakshmana quickly descended the mountain and went to the excellent woodland adjoining the sea."
Yuddha Kanda,4,83,Then Rama reached the extensive ocean with rocks underneath washed by floods of water risen vehemently and spoke these words.
Yuddha Kanda,4,84,"""Oh, Sugreeva! We have reached the abode of Varuna. We should consider now the matter (of how to cross the ocean) with which we were formerly preoccupied."""
Yuddha Kanda,4,85,"""This ocean, the lord of Rivers, is shore less beyond. This sea is impossible to be crossed without a proper strategy."""
Yuddha Kanda,4,86,"""For this reason, let the military be assembled here only. Here, let us discuss the plan how this military of monkeys will reach the other shore."""
Yuddha Kanda,4,87,"Rama, the mighty armed, emaciated due to taking away of Seetha, then reached the sea and ordered thus for the halt of the army there."
Yuddha Kanda,4,88,"""Let all the army be stationed at the sea-shore, Sugreeva! Here, the time has come for us to think about the subject of crossing the ocean."""
Yuddha Kanda,4,89,"""Let not anyone slip away in any direction, leaving his respective unit of army. Let valiant monkeys make a more and it should be known whether there is a hidden danger for us."""
Yuddha Kanda,4,90,"Hearing Rama's words, Sugreeva along with Lakshmana made the army to halt at the sea-shore, stretched with trees."
Yuddha Kanda,4,91,"That army, stationed at the vicinity of the ocean, shined like a second ocean splendid with yellowish white honey-coloured water."
Yuddha Kanda,4,92,"There, those foremost of monkeys reached the woodlands at the shore and settled down, desiring to reach the other shore of the vast sea."
Yuddha Kanda,4,93,"While all the monkeys were halting there, the noise created out of their movement was dominantly heard, concealing the roar of the sea."
Yuddha Kanda,4,94,"That army of the monkeys ruled by Sugreeva, stationed as three divisios (viz. 1. bears 2. long tailed monkes and 3. monkeys) looked fully dedicated to the cause of Rama."
Yuddha Kanda,4,95,That army of monkeys reached the mighty ocean and was delighted to behold the mighty ocean being diffused by the velocity of wind.
Yuddha Kanda,4,96,"Seeing the sea, the abode of Varuna, which was boundless and having the opposite shore far off, inhabitd by a number of demons, the monkey-troups sat down there."
Yuddha Kanda,4,97,"Rendered appalling by the ferocity of fierce alligators and crocodiles, that ocen with its foaming waves at the end of the day and at the beginning of the night, appeared to laugh and dance."
Yuddha Kanda,4,98,"The ocean surged, when the moon rose. The image of moon was reflected limitlessly in it. The sea was full of huge alligators swift as fierce winds along with whales and great fish."
Yuddha Kanda,4,99,"That sea, the abode of Varuna was filled with serpents bestowed with flaming hoods, plunged with mighty aquatic creatures, abounding in various types of mountains, too difficult to cross, with an inaccessible path, suffocationly fathomless and an abode of demons."
Yuddha Kanda,4,100,"Increasing waves of the sea in which sharks and bodies of serpents swarmed, rose and fell whipped into motion by the breeze."
Yuddha Kanda,4,101,"Emitting whirled sparkles, shining with large water-snakes, a fearful abode of enemies of gods forever, the sea reaches upto the uneven Patala (subterranean region)."
Yuddha Kanda,4,102,The ocean looked like the sky. The sky looked like the ocean. The ocean and the sky looked alike without any distinction.
Yuddha Kanda,4,103,"The water blended with sky and the sky blended with water. Filled with stars above and the pearls below, both the sky and the sea looked with the same splendour."
Yuddha Kanda,4,104,"There was no distinction between the two, of the sea filled with a row of waves and of the sky with a row of falling clouds."
Yuddha Kanda,4,105,"The waves of the ocean together banging one another with a terrific resonance, sounded like a kettle-drum in the sky."
Yuddha Kanda,4,106,"Those high-souled monkeys saw the sea lashed with winds, resonating with abundance of precious stones and water, rising high as if enraged in a grip of hurricane, filled with a number of aquatic creatures and tossed by them in the air by seemingly murmuring waves."
Yuddha Kanda,4,107,"The standing monkeys were struck with amazement to see the ocean seemed moving, full of resonance produced by a multitude of dashing waves rolling to and fro."
Yuddha Kanda,5,1,"That famous army, well-protected by Neela, was kept stationed nicely at the northern shore of the ocean."
Yuddha Kanda,5,2,"Both Maina and Dvivida the distinguished monkeys there moved in all directions through that army, for the purpose of vigilance."
Yuddha Kanda,5,3,"After the army was settled at the sea-shore, Rama spoke to Lakshmana who was by his side (as follows):"
Yuddha Kanda,5,4,"""It is so said that sorrow gets vanished at the passing of time. But my agony of not seeing my beloved is getting increased every day."""
Yuddha Kanda,5,5,"""There is no anguish for me that my beloved is at a distance, nor that she was taken away. Her age is indeed passing away. Only about this, I am repenting."""
Yuddha Kanda,5,6,"""Oh, wind! Flow from the side of my beloved. Touch her and touch me too. It is through you that I get a contact of her limbs. It is through moon that I get a contact of her eyes."""
Yuddha Kanda,5,7,"""That darling being carried away; might have cried ""Oh, Lord!"" Seeking for help. That thought is like poison gulped by me, hovering in my stomach and scorching my limbs."""
Yuddha Kanda,5,8,"""My body is scorching night and day, by the fire of passion, holding fuel of my separation from her and my thoughts of her flaring into shimmering flames."""
Yuddha Kanda,5,9,"""Oh, Lakshmana! Diving deep into the sea without you, I shall fall asleep. This flaming passion will not thus scorch me, lying down in water."
Yuddha Kanda,5,10,"""It is enough for me, who is passionate, that Seetha with charming thighs and myself are resting on one the same earth and on this fact I am able to survive."""
Yuddha Kanda,5,11,"""Even as a paddy-field without water survives, by getting wet from a neighboring paddy-field under water, I also survive since I am hearing her as surviving."
Yuddha Kanda,5,12,"""When shall I behold Seetha with charming hips, having long lotus-like eyes flourishing as prosperity, by conquering the enemies?"""
Yuddha Kanda,5,13,"""When, gently raising her face looking like louts, with its beautiful teeth and lips, shall I drink as a sick man the sovereign drink of remedy?"""

Yuddha Kanda,5,16,"""How Seetha the daughter of King Janaka, my darling and Dasaratha's daughter-in-law is sleeping among ogresses?"""
Yuddha Kanda,5,17,"""Seetha will come out, driving away (through my force) the unassailable demons, as driving away black clouds by a digit of the moon, in autumn."""
Yuddha Kanda,5,18,"""Seetha, who by nature is slender, will undoubtedly become leaner further because of her anguish, her abstinence from food and her adverse position of time and place."""
Yuddha Kanda,5,19,"""When shall I bring back Seetha, having lodged arrows in Ravana's chest and having abandoned this mental agony?"""
Yuddha Kanda,5,20,"""When indeed Seetha the virtuous lady similar to the child of a celestial, with an excited longing, will embrace my neck and release tears of joy?"""
Yuddha Kanda,5,21,"""When shall I thrillingly abandon this terrible anguish, born out of my separation from Seetha so soon, as we abandon a soiled clothing?"""

Yuddha Kanda,20,13,"Proceeding in the sky for a distance continuously over the ocean, Shuka then stood up in the sky itself and spoke these words to Sugriva:"
Yuddha Kanda,20,14,"Shuka repeated all the words the wicked Ravana had told him to say to Sugriva. As he was still speaking, the monkeys bounded into the air to reach him at that moment quickly to tear off his wings and to smite him by their fists."
Yuddha Kanda,20,15,The demon thus attacked was forcibly seized by all the monkeys and immediately brought down to the ground from the sky.
Yuddha Kanda,20,16,"Shuka being harassed by monkeys spoke the following words: ""O, Rama! Messengers are not to be killed. Let your monkeys be restrained properly."""
Yuddha Kanda,20,17,"""That messenger, who by abandoning the opinion of his king will speak about his own opinion though he being a messenger and he who on the other hand speaks that which was not told to him, that messenger is indeed fit to be killed."""
Yuddha Kanda,20,18,"Hearing Shuka's complaining words, Rama spoke to the foremost of monkeys, who were beating him as aforesaid, saying ""Do not kill him"""
Yuddha Kanda,20,19,"Perceiving no fear from monkeys, Shuka became light winged, virtually standing in the sky and spoke again the following words."
Yuddha Kanda,20,20,"""O, Sugriva, rich in courage and possessing great strength and valor! What am I to tell Ravana, whose nature is to cause world to cry?"""
Yuddha Kanda,20,21,"Hearing the aforesaid words, the mightily strong Sugriva the king of monkeys and the foremost among them, with a merciless mind then spoke to the blame less Shuka, Ravana's spy, as follows:"
Yuddha Kanda,20,22,"""O, Ravana, worthy of killing! You are not my companion. You are not worthy of sympathy. You are not the person who helped me in any way. I do not like you, as you are Rama's enemy. Hence, You are worthy to be killed like Vali, along with your associates"""
Yuddha Kanda,20,23,"""O, the king of demons! I am killing you along with your sons, relatives and other kinsfolk. Arriving with a great army, I will reduce the entire Lanka and all of you to ashes."""

Yuddha Kanda,20,26,"""You killed Jatayu, the king of vultures and who was senior to you in old age. Why the wide-eyed Sita was not taken away in the presence of Rama and Lakshmana? Having made her captive, you do not recognize her for what she is."""
Yuddha Kanda,20,27,"""You are unaware how strong, high soled and irresistible even to celestials, is this Rama the excellent man of Raghu dynasty, who shall deprive you of your life."""
Yuddha Kanda,20,28,"Thereafter, Angada the son of Vali and the foremost of the monkeys spoke as follows: ""O, Sugriva the highly intelligent! He is not an ambassador. He appears to me as a spy."""
Yuddha Kanda,20,29,"""All our army has been indeed evaluated by him, standing here. Let him be made captive. Let him not return to Lanka. This indeed finds favor with me."""
Yuddha Kanda,20,30,"Commanded then by the king Sugriva, the monkeys jumped up, seized and bound him, who without defence, wailed loudly."
Yuddha Kanda,20,31,"Harassed by those monkeys there, Shuka on his part cried loudly towards Rama, the high soled son of Dasaratha as follows:"
Yuddha Kanda,20,32,"""My wings are being pulled out forcibly. My eyes are being pierced. If I die, all the sins incurred by me between my birth and my death would fall to your share."""
Yuddha Kanda,20,33,"Hearing that lamentation of Shuka, Rama did not allow his killing by the monkeys. Rama ordered monkeys to release him, as he came as an ambassador."
Yuddha Kanda,21,1,"Thereafter Rama, the annihilator of enemies, spreading sacred grass on the sea shore, making a respectful salutation (by joining his palms) to the great ocean with his face turned eastward, lied down with his arm, resembling the body of a snake , as his pillow."
Yuddha Kanda,21,2,"His arm formerly adorned with armlets of gems and gold and the most excellent jewels of pearls, was touched more than once, by excellent women ( Kausalya and other mothers or by royal maids)."
Yuddha Kanda,21,3,"Formerly, his arm used to be tended with sandalwood and aloe and with saffron pastes and made beautiful like the splendor of a rising sun."
Yuddha Kanda,21,4,"In the past, the aforesaid arm was graced by the head of Seetha on the couch. It resembled the body of Takshaka. (A snake) supported on the water of the Ganga."
Yuddha Kanda,21,5,The aforesaid arm resembled a yoke. It enhanced the grief of his enemies in battle. It was delightful to his friends. It is now placed at the shore of the sea.
Yuddha Kanda,21,6,"The aforesaid arm whose skin had been hardened by the strokes of the bow string, off the left arm resembling a great mace and that mighty right arm that bestowed thousands of cows in charity was used as a pillow. Rama, the competent man and the mighty armed said: "" Either crossing of the ocean or a death should occur to me today"". Making that resolve he laid down by the ocean, restraining his speech and with a pious disposition according to tradition."
Yuddha Kanda,21,7,"Following the scriptural injunction, that Rama who was devoted to his sacred vow, while sleeping on the ground spread with Kusha grass, spent a time of three nights there."
Yuddha Kanda,21,8,"Remaining there for three nights, Rama who was skilled in policy and fond of piety, waited upon the ocean, the lord of rivers."
Yuddha Kanda,21,9,"Though honored according to his worth by the self subdued Rama, the careless ocean did not appear in his personal form to Rama."
Yuddha Kanda,21,10,"Rama becoming angry with the ocean, having the outer corners of his eyes turned red, spoke those words to Lakshmana, having auspicious marks, who was in his vicinity:"
Yuddha Kanda,21,11,"""O, what arrogance of the ocean, who does not appear himself personally before me! Indeed calmness, forbearance kind spoken ness and straight -forwardness- these qualities of noble men give weak results, when directed towards those having no virtues."""

Yuddha Kanda,21,17,"""This ocean is considering me as an incapable man endowed as I am with forbearance. It is a great mistake to show forbearance to such an individual."""
Yuddha Kanda,21,18,"""The Ocean is not appearing himself before me on kind words. O, Lakshmana! Bring the bow and the serpentine arrows. I shall dry up this ocean, so that our monkeys can cross it by feet."""
Yuddha Kanda,21,19,"""Being provoked now, I will shake this ocean, even if it is unshakable. I will force the ocean, which is demarcated by banks and agitated with thousands of waves, bereft of a boundary, by my arrows. I will agitate the great ocean, thronged with great demons."""
Yuddha Kanda,21,20,"Speaking as aforesaid, Rama with his eyes made larger by anger and wielding a bow with his hand, became dreadful to look at, as a blazing fire at the end of the world."
Yuddha Kanda,21,21,Swaying his terrific bow and making the earth tremble by his violence Rama released the arrow resembling a powerful thunderbolt of Indra. (god of celestials).
Yuddha Kanda,21,22,"Those excellent arrows having a great speed and ablaze by their splendor, penetrated the waters of the ocean, striking the water- snakes with terror."
Yuddha Kanda,21,23,"The great jerk of water with fishes and alligators of the ocean, together with the resonance of the wind became very much dreadful."
Yuddha Kanda,21,24,"Immediately that great ocean, became shaken by the cluster of huge waves enveloped by a multitude of conches in its rolling waves and a smoke came out."
Yuddha Kanda,21,25,"Sea-snakes having brilliant faces and glittering eyes and the very valiant demons residing in nethermost subterranean region of the sea, were perturbed."
Yuddha Kanda,21,26,"Thousands of waves, so large resembling Vindhya and Mandhara mountains, jumped up from the sea with its crocodiles and sea monsters."
Yuddha Kanda,21,27,"That ocean with its multitude of fluctuating waves, with its frightened serpents and demons, with huge crocodiles coming out, became full of noise."
Yuddha Kanda,21,28,"Then Lakshmana rushed towards Rama who in a terrific velocity was stretching his incomparable bow, with a penetrating sigh, crying: ""No further, no farther"" and took hold of the bow."
Yuddha Kanda,21,29,"""O, honorable man! Even without the destruction of the ocean, the purpose of you the greatest hero will be fulfilled. Men like you do not fall into the sway of anger. You see some durable and noble alternative"""
Yuddha Kanda,21,30,"Brahmana-sages and celestial sages, stationed in the interior of the sky cried in a loud voices, saying ""No farther, no farther"" and making a noise ""Ah,Oh,Alas!"""
Yuddha Kanda,22,1,"Then, Rama spoke these harsh words to the ocean: ""O, ocean! I will make you dry up now along with your nethermost subterranean region."""
Yuddha Kanda,22,2,"""O, Ocean! A vast stretch of sand will appear, when your water gets consumed by my arrows; when you get dried up and the creatures inhabiting you get destroyed by me."""

Yuddha Kanda,22,5,"""Fixing an arrow resembling the Rod of Brahma (the creator) charged with a missile (presided over by Brahama) to his excellent bow, the exceedingly powerful Rama stretched it towards the sea."""
Yuddha Kanda,22,6,"While Rama was stretching that bow, both the heaven and earth suddenly seemed to be split asunder. Mountains also were shaken."
Yuddha Kanda,22,7,Darkness enveloped the world. All the quarters were obscured. Lakes and rivers were soon agitated.
Yuddha Kanda,22,8,"The moon sun and the stars moved obliquely and though the sun's rays lighted the sky, it was enveloped by darkness and shined with a blaze of hundreds of meteors while thunders reverberated with an unparalleled sound in the sky."
Yuddha Kanda,22,9,"Series of celestial winds blew in their colossal form and the winds, then sweeping away the clouds, tore up the trees again and again."
Yuddha Kanda,22,10,"The wind, shattering the mountain peaks, broke off the points of the rocks. Winds of great velocity struck together in the sky and emitted flashes of radiance proceeding from lightning with a great sound and then there were great thunders."
Yuddha Kanda,22,11,"The visible creatures cried out along with the thunders. The invisible beings too gave off a terrific noise. The creatures were overpowered, frightened, agitated, lied down and also very much anguished. They did not move due to fear."
Yuddha Kanda,22,12,"The great ocean with its waves and water, along with its living creatures including snakes and demons soon became possessed of a terrific velocity. Due to that speed and swelling of waters, the ocean crossed beyond the other shore to the extent of a Yojana (eight miles)."
Yuddha Kanda,22,13,"Rama born in Raghu dynasty and the annihilator of enemies, did not retreat before that ocean, which swelled and crossed its limits."
Yuddha Kanda,22,14,"Then, Sagara (the ocean god) himself rose from the middle of the ocean as the sun rises at dawn from the huge mountain of Meru."
Yuddha Kanda,22,15,That ocean along with snakes of flaming jaws appeared with a hue of glossy emerald adorned with gold.
Yuddha Kanda,22,16,"The valiant ocean, the lord of rivers, wearing a wreath of pearls, with his eyes resembling lotus leaves, bearing a beautiful garland made of all kinds of flowers on his head, with ornaments of refined gold, adorned with excellent jewels made of pearls from his domain, decorated with different kinds of gems and metals, resembling Himavat mountain, wearing on his broad chest a locket shedding a white luster, resembling a Kaustubha gem (adorning the blossom of Lord Vishnu) and hanging in the middle of a single string of pearls, with a multitude of waves whirled around him, encircled by the clouds and winds, escorted by rivers mainly the Ganga and Sindhu, endowed with diverse forms resembling various deities, approached Rama with joined palms, who stood with arrows in hand, addressing him first as ï¿½Rama!' and spoke the following words:"
Yuddha Kanda,22,17,"""O, beloved Rama! Earth, wind ether, water and light remain fixed in their own nature, resorting to their eternal path."""
Yuddha Kanda,22,18,"""Therefore, I am fathomless and my nature is that it is impossible of being swum across. It becomes unnatural if I am shallow. I am telling you the following device to cross me."""

Yuddha Kanda,22,20,"""O, Rama! I shall make it possible to see that you are able to cross over. I will arrange a place for the monkeys to cross me and bear with it. As far as the army crosses me, the crocodiles will not be aggressive to them."""
Yuddha Kanda,22,21,"Then, Rama spoke to that ocean as follows: ""Listen to me. This great arrow should not go in vain. In which region should it be descended?"""
Yuddha Kanda,22,22,"Hearing Rama's words and seeing that powerful arrow, the large splendid Ocean spoke the following words to Rama:"
Yuddha Kanda,22,23,"""Towards my northern side, there is a holy place. It is well known as Drumatulya, in the same way as you are well known to this world."""
Yuddha Kanda,22,24,"""Numerous robbers of fearful aspect and deeds, having the sinful Abhiras as their chief, drink my waters there."""

Yuddha Kanda,22,26,"Hearing those words of the high-soled Ocean, Rama released that excellent and splendid arrow towards that place as directed by the ocean."
Yuddha Kanda,22,27,"The place where the arrow, whose splendor was akin to that of a thunder and a thunder bolt, was descended by Rama- that place is indeed famous as desert of Maru* on this earth."
Yuddha Kanda,22,28,"The earth there, pierced by the dart, then emitted a sound . The waters of the penultimate subterranean region gushed forth from the mouth of that cleft."
Yuddha Kanda,22,29,"Then the hollow became known as Vrana. Water constantly seen, gushing forth from it resembled seawater."
Yuddha Kanda,22,30,"A terrific splitting sound was born in that place. Water was dried up in those cavities, as a result of hurling of that arrow by Rama."
Yuddha Kanda,22,31,"That desert of Maru became famous in the three worlds. Rama (the son of Dasaratha), a wise man and a valiant man resembling a celestial, made that cavity dried up and gave a boon to that desert of Maru."
Yuddha Kanda,22,32,"Due to granting of a boon by Rama, that desert of Maru became the most congenial place for cattle rearing, a place with a little of disease, producing tasty fruits and roots, with a lot of clarified butter, a lot of milk and various kinds of sweet- smelling herbs. Thus it became an auspicious and suitable move, bestowing these merits."
Yuddha Kanda,22,33,"While that cavity was burning, Ocean the lord of rivers spoke these words to Rama who knew all scientific treatises."
Yuddha Kanda,22,34,"""O, excellent man! This one, named Nala, a glorious person, is the son of Vishvakarma; who was given a boon by his father and is equal to Visvakarma."""

Yuddha Kanda,22,36,"Thus speaking, the god of Ocean disappeared from that place. Then Nala, the more distinguished among monkeys stood up and spoke the following words to Rama of great power:"

Yuddha Kanda,22,38,"""This Sagara, the formidable mass of water, in fear of punishment, gave a passage to Rama, wishing to see a bridge constructed on it."""

Yuddha Kanda,22,41,"""I am capable of constructing a bridge across the ocean. Hence, let the foremost of monkeys build the bridge now itself."""
Yuddha Kanda,22,42,"Then, being sent by Rama, hundreds and thousands of monkey heroes jumped in joy on all sides towards the great forest."
Yuddha Kanda,22,43,"Those army-chiefs of monkeys, who resembled mountains, broke the rocks and trees there and dragged them away towards the sea."
Yuddha Kanda,22,44,"Those monkeys filled the ocean with all types of trees like Sala and Asvakarna, Dhava and bamboo, Kutaja, Arjuna, palmyra,Tilaka, Tinisa, Bilva, Saptaparna, Karnika, in blossom as also mango and Asoka."
Yuddha Kanda,22,45,"The excellent monkeys, the forest animals lifted and brought, like Indra's flag posts, some trees with roots intact and some others without roots."
Yuddha Kanda,22,46,"From here and there the monkeys brought Palmyra trees, pomegranate shrubs, coconut and Vibhitaka, Karira, Bakula and neem trees."
Yuddha Kanda,22,47,The huge bodied monkeys with mighty strength uprooted elephant-sized rocks and mountains and transported them by mechanical contrivances.
Yuddha Kanda,22,48,"The water, raised up due to sudden throwing of mountains in the sea, soured upward towards the sky and from there again, gushed back."
Yuddha Kanda,22,49,The rocks befalling on all sides perturbed the ocean. Some others drew up strings a hundred Yojanas long (in order to keep the rocks in a straight line.)
Yuddha Kanda,22,50,"Nala on his part initiated a monumental bridge in the middle of the ocean. The bridge was built at that time with the cooperation of other monkeys, of terrible doings."
Yuddha Kanda,22,51,"Some monkeys were holding poles for measuring the bridge and some others collected the material. Reeds and logs resembling clouds and mountains, brought by hundreds of monkeys, lead by the command of Rama, fastened some parts of the bridge."
Yuddha Kanda,22,52,Monkeys constructed the bridge with trees having blossom at the end of their boughs. Some monkeys looking like demons seized rocks resembling mountains and peaks of mountains and appeared running hither and thither.
Yuddha Kanda,22,53,"Then, a tumultuous sound occurred when the rocks were thrown into the sea and when mountains were caused to fall there."
Yuddha Kanda,22,54,"On the first day, fourteen Yojanas of bridge were constructed by the monkeys speedily, thrilled with delight as they were, resembling elephants."
Yuddha Kanda,22,55,"In the same manner, on the second day twenty Yojanas of bridge were constructed speedily by the monkeys of terrific bodies and of mighty strength."
Yuddha Kanda,22,56,"Thus, on the third day twenty-one Yojanas of the bridge were constructed in the ocean speedily by the monkeys with their colossal bodies."
Yuddha Kanda,22,57,"On the forth day, a further of twenty-two Yojanas were constructed by the dashing monkeys with a great speed."
Yuddha Kanda,22,58,"In that manner, on the fifth day, the monkeys working quickly constructed twenty-three yojanas of the bridge up to the other seashore."
Yuddha Kanda,22,59,"That Nala, the strong and illustrious son of Visvakarma and an excellent monkey built the bridge across the sea as truly as his father would have built it."
Yuddha Kanda,22,60,"That beautiful and lovely bridge constructed by Nala across the ocean the abode of alligators, shone brightly like a milky way of stars in the sky."
Yuddha Kanda,22,61,"With a desire to behold that marvel, celestials along with Gandharvas, the heavenly musicians, Siddhas (semi-divine beings of great purity and perfection, possessing super natural qualities) and great sages came then and stood up in the sky."
Yuddha Kanda,22,62,"The celestials and Gandharvas, the heavenly musicians saw Nala's bridge, having a width of ten yojanas and a length of hundred yojanas and which was very difficult to be built."
Yuddha Kanda,22,63,"The monkeys taking long leaps and short leaps shouted in joy. All other beings saw that construction of the bridge across the ocean as unimaginable, impossible and wonderful, causing their hair to stand on end in amazement."
Yuddha Kanda,22,64,Those thousand crores of monkeys in a great spectacle reached the other shore of the great ocean soon after building that bridge across the sea.
Yuddha Kanda,22,65,"That colossal bridge, which was broad, well-constructed, glorious, well postured and held together firmly, looked beautiful like a separating straight line in the ocean."
Yuddha Kanda,22,66,"Vibhishana, wielding a mace in his hand, stood up on the seashore along with his ministers, for the purpose of invading the enemies."
Yuddha Kanda,22,67,"Thereafter, Sugriva on his part spoke to Rama, the truly brave man as follows: ""O, valiant man! This ocean, the abode of alligators, is indeed vast.

Yuddha Kanda,22,68,"Rama the glorious and righteous man, wielding a bow along with Lakshmana together with Sugriva, went in front of that army."
Yuddha Kanda,22,69,Some monkeys went along the middle of the bridge. Some others went along the sides. Some others were jumping into water. Some others marched forward on the path. Some monkeys entered the sky and aviated like Garuda the eagle.
Yuddha Kanda,22,70,The highly terrific sound of the ocean was covered up by the great sounds of the terrific monkeys who were crossing the sea.
Yuddha Kanda,22,71,"That army of monkeys, which crossed the ocean by the bridge constructed by Nala, was encamped by Sugriva at a shore having many fruits tubers and water."
Yuddha Kanda,22,72,"Seeing that Rama's accomplishment, which was amazing and arduous; celestials, Siddhas (semi-divine beings possessing supernatural faculties) and Charanas (celestial bards) along with great sages, forthwith approached Rama and consecrated him with very splendid waters separately."

Yuddha Kanda,40,4,"On seeing Ravana, Sugreeva got up all at once, while Rama and the chiefs of the army of monkeys were looking on."
Yuddha Kanda,40,5,"Gathering up his strength and courage, Sugreeva, in an impulse of fury, bounded from the summit of the mountain and then sprang to the top of the gate (where Ravana was)."
Yuddha Kanda,40,6,"For a moment, he paused and then with a fearless soul, he saw that demon, whom he regarded as a mere straw and thereafter spoke the following words harshly:"
Yuddha Kanda,40,7,"""O, demon! I am a friend and a servant of Rama, the Lord of the world. You will not be spared by me today, by the inspiring grace of Rama."""
Yuddha Kanda,40,8,"Thus speaking, Sugreeva jumped up all at once, bounced over on ravana, pulled his brightly coloured crown from his head and threw it away on the ground."
Yuddha Kanda,40,9,"Seeing Sugreeva about to rush upon him again, Ravana spoke as follows: ""You were Sugreeva (one who has a handsome neck), when your were not present before my eyes. But now, you will now become Hinagriva bereft of your neck."""
Yuddha Kanda,40,10,"Speaking thus, Ravana raised up and quickly flung Sugreeva to the ground with both his arms. Bouncing like a ball, Sugreeva flung back his adversary with his arms."
Yuddha Kanda,40,11,"Ravana and Sugreeva of great strength carried on a duel which was unbearable, with perspiration broke out on their limbs, with their bodies red with blood, each clung to other other paralyzing his opponent's movements resembling silk-cotton and Kimshuka trees, followed by blows of fists, slaps of hands blows of elbows and blows of fingers on each other."
Yuddha Kanda,40,12,"Having wrestled for a long time in the center of the flat floor of the gate way, each in turn repeatedly lifting their bodies and bending their feet in a particular way, the two highly swift combatants remained in that flat roof of the gate way."
Yuddha Kanda,40,13,"Crushing one another and their bodies clung together, they both dropped down between the defensive walls and the moat. They would leap up again, seizing each other from the ground, after pausing an instant to regain their breath."
Yuddha Kanda,40,14,"With arms interlaced like with ropes joined together, they remained locked together in the struggle. Both of them, who had received training in wrestling and fully endowed with night, were now moving to and fro in the arena."
Yuddha Kanda,40,15,"The two heroes, who resembled a tiger and a a lion having their tusks growing or two young lordly elephants encountening in a hostile manner, with arms interlaced and having duly tried their strength, fell on the ground together."
Yuddha Kanda,40,16,"Thereafter rising, those two heroes hurled themselves on each other, circling around the arena again and again, like skilled and mighty wrestlers, nor were they easily fatigued."
Yuddha Kanda,40,17,"Like unto great tuskers with their enormous arms resembling the trunks, those two warriors were keeping back each other, fought vehemently for a long time and moved speedily in a circular arena."
Yuddha Kanda,40,18,"Approaching each other like tow wild cats fighting over a piece of meat trying to kill each other, they stood growling again and again."
Yuddha Kanda,40,19,"The two warriors, Sugreeva and Ravana, who were skilled in wrestling, excuted innumerable and myraid evolutions, taking up diverse postures, moving in a curved line like an ox's urine, coming and going, stepping side ways, having a retrograde motion to avoid blows, turning about abandoning the attack, dashing towards each other, leaping, standing firm and erect, retreated, turned sideways, rushed in a bent posture, ran lifting their foot to kick the opponent and by letting go or stealing away."
Yuddha Kanda,40,20,"Meanwhile, Ravana decided to common using his magic power. Knowing it, Sugreeva flew into the sky triumphantly shaking off all fatigue, while Ravana, baffled by Sugreeva stood confounded there alone."
Yuddha Kanda,40,21,"Thus, the Lord of the monkeys, acquiring fame as a warrior, reducing Ravana to exhaustion, ascended into the infinite sky and the offspring of the Sun then went to the side of Rama, who as in the middle of the mokye-troops."
Yuddha Kanda,40,22,"That Sugreeva, the offspring of the Sun, who was endowed with a speed of the wind, having accomplished that feat there, increasing the military zeal of the foremost of Raghu dynasty, honoured by the monkey leaders and delighted, rejoined the army."
Yuddha Kanda,41,1,"Seeing the marks of conflict on the person of Sugreeva, Rama the elder brother of Lakshmana after embracing Sugreeva spoke these words."
Yuddha Kanda,41,2,"""Without consulting me closely, such a reckless act has been done by you, such a rashness is not seemly in a king."""
Yuddha Kanda,41,3,"""O, warrior longing for acts of daring! This wrong and reckless act has been done by you, causing me, this army and Vibhishana great anxiety."""
Yuddha Kanda,41,4,"""O, warrior! O, vanquisher of foes! Do not act thus in future. O, the mighty armed! O, annihilator of enemies! If you have come by some misfortune, I would have had nothing to do with Seetha, Bharata, Lakshmana or still younger Shatrughna or even with my own person."""
Yuddha Kanda,41,5,"""O, monkey of great strength, equal to Indra the god of celestials and Varuna the king of universe! If you have not returned, though I am conversant with your valour, this was my pre-determined resolve that having killed Ravana in fight with his sons forces and chariots, I should have installed Vibhishana as king of Lanka, placing the kingdom of Ayodhya in the hands of Bharata and renounced my life."""
Yuddha Kanda,41,6,"Hearing Rama's words, Sugreeva replied as follows: ""O, brave Rama! Seeing Ravana who had taken away your consort and being conscious of my own strength, how can I act otherwise?"""
Yuddha Kanda,41,7,"Complimenting that hero Sugreeva who was thus speaking, Rama addressed Lakshmana, who was endowed with auspicious marks, saying:"
Yuddha Kanda,41,8,"""O, Lakshmana! Beside these fresh waters and trees laden with fruit, let us divide this multitude of troops, drawing it up in a battle array and remain alert."""
Yuddha Kanda,41,9,"""I foresee a terrible calamity to come, boding universal destruction and death to the intrepid bears, monkeys and demons."""
Yuddha Kanda,41,10,"""Harsh winds blow. The earth trembles. Mountain-peaks shake and the elephants bearing the earth trumpet."""
Yuddha Kanda,41,11,"""Sinister clouds prey-roar violently like carnivorous animals and let fall a rain mixed with drops of blood."""
Yuddha Kanda,41,12,"""The dusk, red as sandal, is full of horror and from the sun, this blazing mass of fire falls."""
Yuddha Kanda,41,13,"""Wile beasts and birds emit frantic cries, ill at ease and ominous, inspiring great fear, facing the sun."""
Yuddha Kanda,41,14,"""The moon shorn of its radiance, surrounded by black and fiery rays, burns red as at the time of destruction of the word and is creating an anguish in the night."""
Yuddha Kanda,41,15,"""O, Lakshmana! In the disk of the sun, a small halo with a black mark, fiery, shorn of its radiance and of coppery hue is seen."""
Yuddha Kanda,41,16,"""O, Lakshmana! The stars are not appearing as they should be duly foretelling their intention to hasten a final dissolution of the world."""
Yuddha Kanda,41,17,"""Crows, eagles and vultures are whirling round at a lower level. Jackals too are howling inauspicious sounds."""
Yuddha Kanda,41,18,"""The earth, crowded with rocks, darts and daggers discharged by monkeys and demons, will become a slime of flesh and blood."""
Yuddha Kanda,41,19,"""Now surrounded by the monkeys from all sides, let us make an attack on that invincible citadel ruled by Ravana quickly and swiftly."""
Yuddha Kanda,41,20,"Thus speaking to Lakshmana, the heroic Rama of great strength climbed down from that mountain-peak."
Yuddha Kanda,41,21,"Having descended from that mountain, Rama, whose mind was set on righeousness, held a review of his own army, which was verily difficult to conquer for the enemies."
Yuddha Kanda,41,22,"Rama, who knew the fitting moment to act, along with Sugreeva made ready the great army and commanded the army to advance, at the appropriate moment for the battle."
Yuddha Kanda,41,23,"Rama, the mighty armed, together with the mighty army marched in front, wielding a bow, towards the city of Lanka, at the befitting moment."
Yuddha Kanda,41,24,"Then, Vibhishana, Sugreeva, Hanuman, Jambavan the king of bears, Nala, Nila and Lakshmana accompanied that Rama."
Yuddha Kanda,41,25,"Thereafter, fully covering a vast stretch of land, the great army of bears and monkeys, followed in the wake of Rama."
Yuddha Kanda,41,26,"Monkeys, the annihilator of enemies, resembling elephants, took hold of mountain-peaks and hundreds of well-grown huge trees."
Yuddha Kanda,41,27,"Those two brothers Rama and Lakshmana, the destroyers of their adversaries, reached the city of Lanka ruled by Ravana, in not a long time."
Yuddha Kanda,41,28,"The monkeys, encouraged by the sound of Rama's voice and obedient to his command, halted before the city of Lanka, garlanded with banners, beautiful and splendid with pleasure-gardens, having an unusual rampart which is inaccessible with its elevated arched door-ways and invincible even by the celestials."
Yuddha Kanda,41,29,"Reaching the city of Lanka ruled by Ravana, the heroic Rama the son of Dasaratha accompanied by Lakshmana, halted near the northern gate, where Ravana stayed. Who else but Rama is capable of protecting the army besieging that gate, regulated by Ravana, as an ocean, regulated by Varuna, guarded by awful demons on all sides and creating fear to the weak as a subterranean region is guarded by demons?"
Yuddha Kanda,41,30,Rama saw various types and multitude of weapons and shields kept there by the warriors.
Yuddha Kanda,41,31,"Nila, the valiant army-chief of monkeys together with Mainda and Dvivida reached and halted before the Eastern gate."
Yuddha Kanda,41,32,"Angada of very mighty prowess, together with Rishhabha, Gavaksha, Gaja and Gavaya took charge of the Southern gate."
Yuddha Kanda,41,33,"The strong monkey Hanuman together with Prajangha, Tarasa and other warriors, guarded the western gate."
Yuddha Kanda,41,34,"Sugreeva, along with all the chiefs of monkeys equal to the strength of Garuda (the eagle and the vehicle of Vishnu) as well as Vayu the god of the wind, was stationed himself in the middle of the fort."
Yuddha Kanda,41,35,"Thirty six crores of monkeys, highly renowned generals stood besiezed, where the monkey Sugreeva was there, having exerted pressure on the demons occupying that post."
Yuddha Kanda,41,36,"Meanwhile, under Rama's command, Lakshmana along with Vibhishana distributed a crore each of his monkeys at each gate."
Yuddha Kanda,41,37,"Behind Rama and not far from him, Sushena together with Jambavan, followed by a multitude of forces, stood at the intermediate post."
Yuddha Kanda,41,38,"Those lions among the monkeys, possessing the teeth of tigers, taking hold of trees and rocks, waited delightedly for the signal to fight."
Yuddha Kanda,41,39,"All of them were lashing their tails feverishly, using their jaws and nails as weapons, trembling in every limb and had their faces set grimly."
Yuddha Kanda,41,40,"Some were having the strength of ten elephants, some a ten times of that and some were equal to the strength of a thousand elephants."
Yuddha Kanda,41,41,"Some were having the strength of an ogha* of elephants. Some were endowed with a strength of ten times to that. some others there were chiefs of monkeys, having an immeasurable strength."
Yuddha Kanda,41,42,"Marvellous and astonishing was the gathering of those troops of monkeys there, like a swarm of locusts."
Yuddha Kanda,41,43,"By the monkeys who reached Lanka and by those stationed already beneath its walls, the air and earth seem to be completely filled."
Yuddha Kanda,41,44,"A hundred divisions of one lakh each of bears and monkeys poured towards the gates of Lanka, while others proceeded to fight on every side."
Yuddha Kanda,41,45,Those monkeys covered the mountain on every side. A crore of them ranged round that city.
Yuddha Kanda,41,46,Even winds were unable to penetrate Lanka being surrounded on all sides by heroic monkeys holding tree trunks in their hands.
Yuddha Kanda,41,47,"The demons, who in their valour equaled Indra the ruler of gods, seeing themselves besieged, as by clouds, were struck with sudden terror."
Yuddha Kanda,41,48,"While the flock of monkey- troops was advancing there, a tremendous clamour arose, resembling a roar in the ocean beating against its shore."
Yuddha Kanda,41,49,"By that great tumult, the entire Lanka with its ramparts arches, hills, woods and forests began to tremble."
Yuddha Kanda,41,50,"That army of monkeys, guarded by Rama, Lakshmana and Sugreeva became even more invinceible than all the celestials and demons put together."
Yuddha Kanda,41,51,"Having thus ranged his forces, with a view to destroy the demons, Rama who knew about the four expedients (to be used against an enemy in the shape of conciliation, gift, sowing dissension and punishment) employed in succession, took counsel again and again with his ministers and arrived at a decision. Calling to his mind the duty of the kings, Rama who was eager to undertake what was to be done next, in concurrence with Vibhishana, summoned Angada the son of Vali and spoke as follows:"
Yuddha Kanda,41,52,"""Go my gentle Angada on my behalf and, passing thought the city of Lanka without fear and anxiety and Lanka without fear and anxiety and approaching Ravana - the unfortunate demon devoid of sovereignty and who has lost his splendour because of his inclination to die - admonish him in the following words:"""
Yuddha Kanda,41,53,"""O, Ravana the Ranger of the Night! In your reckless arrogance, sages, celestials, celestial musicians and their wives, serpent - demons, yakshas the semi-divine beings and kings have been oppressed by you. From now on, that arrogance, born of the boon you received from Brahma the Lord of creation, shall be subdued."""
Yuddha Kanda,41,54,"""I shall inflict a fitting penalty for your ruthless abduction of my consort. I am stationed myself at the gate of Lanka, with a Rod of chastisement."""
Yuddha Kanda,41,55,"""O, demon! Slain by me, you will attain the region of Gods, of all the great sages and all the royal sages."""
Yuddha Kanda,41,56,"""O, the worst demon! Demonstrate the same courage and magic that you did employ in bearing Seetha away from me."""
Yuddha Kanda,41,57,"""If you do not make an appeal to my clemency by returning Seetha, I shall make this world devoid of all demons."""
Yuddha Kanda,41,58,"""This pious minded Vibhishana, the foremost of demons has come to me. Surely, this illustrious demon will obtain the kingdom of Lanka, which will henceforth be free from troubles."""
Yuddha Kanda,41,59,"""You, without a knowledge of the self and a sinful demon having stupid followers around you, cannot indeed enjoy the kingdom even for a moment, by this unrighteousness."""
Yuddha Kanda,41,60,"""O, demon! Otherwise, get ready for a battle, by gathering courage and laying hold of your valour. Having been slain by my arrows in combat, you will be laid in peace."
Yuddha Kanda,41,61,"""O, Ranger of the Night! Even if you range the three worlds in the forms of a bird, you will not return alive, when you come into my range of sight."""
Yuddha Kanda,41,62,"""I give you this salutary counsel prepare for your obsequies. Let Lanka be obliged to be seen well by you (like your last sight), as your survival is in my hands."""
Yuddha Kanda,41,63,"Hearing the words of Rama, who was unwearied in action, Angada the son of Tara, leapt into air like a god of fire personified and marched ahead."
Yuddha Kanda,41,64,"Reaching Ravana's palace in an instant, the illustrious Angada saw Ravana, seated coolly along with his ministers."
Yuddha Kanda,41,65,"Angada, the foremost of the monkeys, wearing golden bracelets, descended close to the king and stood there like a flaming torch."
Yuddha Kanda,41,66,"Having made himself known, Angada communicated, that whole of the excellent speech of Rama without adding or subtracting anything to Ravana in the presence of Ravana's ministers, saying:"
Yuddha Kanda,41,67,"""I am the son of Vali, Angada by name. I have come as a messenger for the king of Koshala, Rama of imperishable exploits. Has my name ever reached your ears?"""
Yuddha Kanda,41,68,"""Rama who is born in Raghu dynasty and who augements the joy of Kausalya speaks thus to you, ï¿½O, ruthless demon! Come forth and enter into combat. Prove to be the representative of your race!' """
Yuddha Kanda,41,69,""" ï¿½I shall kill you along with your ministers, sons, cousins and other relatives. You being dead, all the three worlds will be rid of fear.'"""
Yuddha Kanda,41,70,""" ï¿½Now, I shall uproot you, a thorn to sages and an enemy to celestials, demons, semi-divine beings, celestial musicians, serpent-gods and ogres'."""
Yuddha Kanda,41,71,"""If you do not restore Seetha honourably, by bowing respectfully before me, you are slain and Vibhishana will become the king.'"""
Yuddha Kanda,41,72,"Hearing these harsh words from Angada the lion among the monkeys, Ravana the Lord of the demon-tribe was infuriated."
Yuddha Kanda,41,73,"Then, the enraged Ravana repeatedly commanded his attendants, saying: ""Let this stupid monkey be seized and put to death."""
Yuddha Kanda,41,74,"Hearing Ravana's words, four terrible demons seized Angada who, in his splendour, resembled a blazing torch."
Yuddha Kanda,41,75,"Then, the prudent and heroic Angada the son of Tara voluntarily allowed himself to be seized, in order to display his prowess before the host of demons."
Yuddha Kanda,41,76,"Then, seizing like unto birds those attendants clung to his arms, Angada leapt on to the palace that resembled like a mountain."
Yuddha Kanda,41,77,All those four demons were shaken out by Angada's impetuous leap and fell on the ground there under the eyes of their king.
Yuddha Kanda,41,78,"Thereafter, the glorious Angada the son of Vali ascended the roof of Ravana's palace, which equaled the summit of a mountain in height."
Yuddha Kanda,41,79,"That roof of the palace, trampled by Angada, crumbled - as a peak of Himalayan range was shattered long ago by lightening - before Ravana's gaze."
Yuddha Kanda,41,80,"After destroying the roof of the palace, Angada proclaimed his name and with a triumphant roar, rose into the air."
Yuddha Kanda,41,81,"Causing restlessness to all the demons but delight to the monkeys, Angada approached close to Rama, who was stationed in the middle of the monkey-forces."
Yuddha Kanda,41,82,"Because of the destruction of his palace, Ravana on his part got extremely angry. Foreseeing his own destruction, he became a desponded demon."
Yuddha Kanda,41,83,"Surrounded by many monkeys, roaring with delight, Rama on his part was proceeding ahead already for the battle, with an intent to wipe out the enemy."
Yuddha Kanda,41,84,"Now, Sushena the highly valiant monkey, was stationed there like the head of the mountain surrounded by innumerable monkeys, who were bale to change their form at will."
Yuddha Kanda,41,85,"Under the order of Sugreeva, the invincible monkey, Sushena was patrolling the gates and wandering like a moon among the stars."
Yuddha Kanda,41,86,"Seeing hundreds of divisions of those monkeys encamped under the walls of Lanka, marshaled on the shores of the sea, the demons were amazed and some others were terror-struck while others, overjoyed at the prospect of fighting, leapt even in exultation."
Yuddha Kanda,41,87,"Those miserable demons saw the entire extensive space between the walls and the moat being occupied by the monkeys, like unto a second rampart. The demons cried out, ""Woe! Alas!"" in panic."
Yuddha Kanda,41,88,"As a result of that appalling tumult in the capital city of the demons, the soldiers of Ravana seized hold of their great weapons and sallied forth like the winds that blow at the dissolution of the worlds."
Yuddha Kanda,42,1,"Then, the demons there, approached Ravana and informed him that the city had been besieged by Rama along with his monkeys."
Yuddha Kanda,42,2,"Hearing that the city has been attacked, Ravana exhibiting his anger, doubly made the necessary arrangements for the war and ascended his mansion."
Yuddha Kanda,42,3,"That Ravana caught a glimpse of the city of Lanka, with its mountains, groves and forests all being covered by innumerable troops of monkeys, waiting for war."
Yuddha Kanda,42,4,"Seeing the earth made all brown with innumerable monkeys, Ravana in great perplexity reflected: ""How can they be exterminated?"""
Yuddha Kanda,42,5,"Having pondered for long, regaining his confidence and with his eyes widened by surprise, Ravana gazed on Rama and his troops of monkeys."
Yuddha Kanda,42,6,"Full of delight, Rama passed forward (on the back of a monkey) along with his army and saw Lanka being guarded on all sides and thronged with demons."
Yuddha Kanda,42,7,"Seeing that city of Lanka duly decorated with banners and flags, Rama remembered Seetha with a distressed heart."
Yuddha Kanda,42,8,"He said to himself, ""Here is that daughter of Janaka, whose eyes resemble those of a fawn, tormented with grief, emacitated, with a bare ground as her bed and suffering here on my account."""
Yuddha Kanda,42,9,"Reflecting on Seetha being troubled, the virtuous Rama speedily issued a command to the monkeys to destroy the enemies forthwith."
Yuddha Kanda,42,10,"Hearing those words of Rama, who was unwearied in action, the monkeys vying with one another filled the air with their roaring resembling those of lion."
Yuddha Kanda,42,11,"""We shall tear asunder this Lanka with mountain-peaks or with fists alone."" - thus resolved all the monkey- generals."
Yuddha Kanda,42,12,"Lifting up mountain peaks and huge rocks and plucking up various kinds of trees, the monkey-generals stood prepared (for the attack)."
Yuddha Kanda,42,13,"In order to fulfill Rama's cherished desire, those troops, forming themselves into columns, began to scale the heights of Lanka, while Ravana stood gazing."
Yuddha Kanda,42,14,"Those monkeys, of golden hue with coppery countenance, fighting with Sala trees and mountain-peaks, marched ahead towards the city of Lanka, ready as they were to lay down their lives in Rama's service."
Yuddha Kanda,42,15,"Those monkeys demolished innumerable defensive walls and arches with blows from trees, mountain-tops and fists."
Yuddha Kanda,42,16,"The monkeys filled the moats containing clear water with sands, mountain-tops, grasses and logs of wood."
Yuddha Kanda,42,17,"The commanders scaled the walls of Lanks, taking with them battalions of monkeys in thousands, in crores and even hundreds of crores."
Yuddha Kanda,42,18,The monkeys stood tearing up the golden arches and breaking down the gates that equaled the peak of Kailasa the mountainous abode of Shiva the Lord of Destruction.
Yuddha Kanda,42,19,"The monkeys who resembled great elephants hurled themselves towards that Lanka, springing, leaping and roaring."
Yuddha Kanda,42,20,"The monkeys, who were able to change their form at will, shouting - ""Victory to the mighty Rama and the valiant Lakshmana!"" ""Victory of Sugreeva protected by Raghava!"" and roaring, rushed towards the defensive walls of Lanka."
Yuddha Kanda,42,21,"Those monkey-generals Virabahu, Subahu, Nala and Panasa, having position on them. Meanwhile, they formed an encampment of a multitude of military divisions there."
Yuddha Kanda,42,22,"The mighty Kumuda, surrounded by a crore of monkeys, who behaved like conquerors, stood besieging the eastern gate (while remaining stationed in north-east)."
Yuddha Kanda,42,23,"Surrounded by other monkeys, a monkey called Prasabha and the mighty armed Panasa too up their position, in order to assist Kumuda himself."
Yuddha Kanda,42,24,"The strong and valiant monkey, Shatabali accompanied by twenty crores of monkeys, approached the southern gate (while remaining stationed in south-east) and stood there, to obstruct the exit."
Yuddha Kanda,42,25,"The mighty monkey named Sushena, the father of Tara (Vali's wife), going to the western gate (while remaining stationed in the south-west) surrounded by crores and croes of monkeys, stood besieging that gate."
Yuddha Kanda,42,26,"Rama along with Lakshmana and Sugreeva the mighty lord of the monkeys, seeking the northern gate (while remaining stationed in the north west) stood besieging that gate."
Yuddha Kanda,42,27,"Accompanied by a crore of bears having terrific rage, Dhumra (brother of Jambavan, the king of bears) of great prowess and the annihilator of enemies, took up his position by the side of Rama."
Yuddha Kanda,42,28,"Vibhishana of great energy with mace in hand, clad in defensive armour and accompanied by his watchful ministers, took his position where the mighty Rama is stationed."
Yuddha Kanda,42,29,"Gavaksha, Gavaya, Sharabha and Gandhamadana, galloping on all sides, defended the army of monkeys."
Yuddha Kanda,42,30,"Ravana the lord of demons with his mind filled in anger, then commanded for the decamping of the entire army immediately."
Yuddha Kanda,42,31,"At this command coming from Ravana lips, a tremendous clamour arose among the demons."
Yuddha Kanda,42,32,"By beating with sticks of gold, the demons stirred up on every side, kettle drums whose discs were white as the moon."
Yuddha Kanda,42,33,"Hundreds and thousands of sonorous couches blared forth, blown with their cheeks extended to the full, by the most ghastly demons."
Yuddha Kanda,42,34,"With their handsome limbs equipped with couches, those rangers of night shone like clouds bordered with lightning accompanied by rows of cranes."
Yuddha Kanda,42,35,"The battalions rushed forth under Ravana's instructions like the rushing forth of the ocean, which is swollen by the clouds, at the time of universal dissolution."
Yuddha Kanda,42,36,"Then, from every side a clamour, arose from the army of monkeys, which filled Malaya mountain with its ridges, plains and caves."
Yuddha Kanda,42,37,"The sound of couches and drums made by the demons and the leouine roars of those monkey- warriors re-echoed over the earth, sky and sea."
Yuddha Kanda,42,38,"With the trumpeting of elephants, the neighing of the horses, the clattering of the chariot-wheels and the sounds of the foot-steps, the sound of the couches reechoed over the earth, sky and sea."
Yuddha Kanda,42,39,"In the meantime, a terrible struggle ensued between the demons and the monkeys, as in the former times between celestials and demons."
Yuddha Kanda,42,40,"Exhibiting their native prowess, the demons began to strike all the monkeys with their flaming maces, spears, harpoons and axes."
Yuddha Kanda,42,41,"Then, the gigantic monkeys swiftly struck those demons with trees, mountain-tops, nails and teeth ""Victorious is king Sugreeva"" - thus arose a loud war-cry."
Yuddha Kanda,42,42,"Then, some other terrifying demons on their part, shouting ""Be winsome! Be victorious!"", proclaimed their own respective names. While some demons standing on walls hacked at the monkeys standing on the ground (below) with hooks and harpoons."
Yuddha Kanda,42,43,"The enraged monkeys, who wee standing on the ground, leapt into the air and dragged down the demons stationed on the walls by seizing them with their arms."
Yuddha Kanda,42,44,"That tumultuous combat between demons and monkeys transformed into a wonder, leaving a mire of flesh and blood."
Yuddha Kanda,43,1,While highly wise monkey-troops and the demons were fighting a terrible military ferocity arose in them.
Yuddha Kanda,43,2,"Those demons, the best of ogres, doing terrific acts and eager to triumph in Ravana's name, marched ahead on steeds with golden trappings or elephants resembling pointed flames, or in chariots flashing like the sun and themselves wearing beautiful armours, creating reverberant sounds in the ten regions."
Yuddha Kanda,43,3,"The great army of monkeys, also eager to triumph, marched opposite to those troops of demons of terrible acts."
Yuddha Kanda,43,4,"Extra-ordinary duels arose between those demons and monkeys, who ran up towards each other."
Yuddha Kanda,43,5,"The demon Indrajit of immense energy fought with Angada the son of Vali, as the demon Andhaka fought with Shiva the Lord of destruction."
Yuddha Kanda,43,6,The ever indomitable Sampati fought with Prajangha and Hanuman the monkey measured his strength with Jambumali.
Yuddha Kanda,43,7,"The demon with great fury, Vibhishana the younger brother of Ravana confronted with Shatrughna possessing fiery velocity in battle."
Yuddha Kanda,43,8,Gaja of great strength fought with a demon called Tapana and Nila too of great energy fought with Nikumbha.
Yuddha Kanda,43,9,Sugreeva the king of monkeys confronted well with Praghasa and the glorious Lakshmana confronted with Virupaksha in the battle.
Yuddha Kanda,43,10,"The invincible Agniketu, Rashmiketu, Mitraghnu and Yajnakopa confronted with Rama."
Yuddha Kanda,43,11,Vajramushti confronted with Mainda and Ashaniprabha with Dvivida. Those principal monkeys Mainda and Dvivida confronted with those highly terrific demons.

Yuddha Kanda,43,13,"That great monkey called Sushena, the strong son of Yama fought with Vidyunmali."
Yuddha Kanda,43,14,"Some other dreadful monkeys, having finished their fight with many demons, swiftly got a duel with some other demons."

Yuddha Kanda,44,32,"That Indrajit the son of Ravana, the sinful demon who had gone out of sight and was cruel in battle, rendered himself as invisible again and hurled forth sharp arrows, bright as lightning."

Yuddha Kanda,45,3,"All those monkeys, thrilled with enthusiasm, flung into the air brandishing huge trunks of trees in order to explore the ten regions."
Yuddha Kanda,45,4,"Indrajit, the son of Ravana, who was skilled in the use of magic weapons, by means of his arrows with great speed, released from his most excellent of bows, arrested the impetuous outbreak of the monkeys."

Yuddha Kanda,45,7,"The bodies of both those warriors, Rama and Lakshmana were densely transfixed with serpentine arrows by the enraged Indrajit."
Yuddha Kanda,45,8,Blood flowed from the wound-marks of both Rama and Lakshmana and both of them shone like Kimshuka trees in flowring.
Yuddha Kanda,45,9,"At that instant, though still invisible, Indrajit, Ravana's son, with his inflamed eyes, which resembled a mass of collyrium mixed with oil, spoke the following words to those two brothers."
Yuddha Kanda,45,10,"""When I enter into combat, making myself invisible, even Indra the lord of celestials is not able to see or approach me. How much less, you two!"""
Yuddha Kanda,45,11,"""O, Descendents of Raghu! Having imprisoned you in this net work of arrows furnished with heron's feathers, I, yielding myself up to the violence of my wrath, am about to dispatch you to the region of Yama the Lord of Death."""
Yuddha Kanda,45,12,"Speaking thus to the brothers Rama and Lakshmana, who were aware of righteousness, Indrajit pierced them with pointed arrows and shouted too exultantly."
Yuddha Kanda,45,13,"Indrajit, who was as black as a heap of shattered collyrium, stretching his immense bow, discharged formidable arrows even once more, in that great fight."
Yuddha Kanda,45,14,"That warrior, Indrajit, who was aware of their vital parts, set up a continual shouting, digging sharp arrows into the vital parts of Rama and Lakshmana."
Yuddha Kanda,45,15,"Those two princes, in the forefront of battle, bounded by that net work of arrows in the twinkling of an eye, became incapable of even looking up."
Yuddha Kanda,45,16,"Pierced in their vital parts, exhausted, and covered all over with heads of arrows, those two mighty and courageous archers fell to the earth, they who were the lords of the earth, shaking violently like a pair of flag-staffs in honour of Indra the Lord celestials and freed from their raised of chords."
Yuddha Kanda,45,17,"Those warriors, Rama and Lakshmana, lying on that heroes' bed (on the battle-ground), bathed in blood, all their limbs bristling with arrows and extremely injured, felt distressed."
Yuddha Kanda,45,18,"There was not a finger's breadth on their bodies form the tips of their fingers to the end of their feet that was not lacerated, implanted and pierced by those arrows."
Yuddha Kanda,45,19,"Struck down by that ferocious demon, who was able to change his shape at will, the hot blood gushed forth from both Rama and Lashmana, as water from a spring."

Yuddha Kanda,45,21,"Indrajit pierced Rama by arrows with golden shafts, with sharp points, which had downward movement, which go fast, Narchas, Demi-narachas, Bhallas (with wide tips), Anjalis, Vatsa dantas, Simha dantas and those shafts like unto razors."
Yuddha Kanda,45,22,"Throwing asunder his bow bent at three places, adorned with gold, with its string loosened away and detached from the hold of his fist, Rama lied down on the battle-ground."
Yuddha Kanda,45,23,"Seeing Rama the excellent man fallen, at a distance of an arrows range, Lakshman became hopeless about his own life."
Yuddha Kanda,45,24,"Seeing his elder brother Rama, with his eyes resembling lotus-leaves, having fallen on the ground, wounded as he was by a net work of arrows, Lakshmana felt sad."
Yuddha Kanda,45,25,"Beholding that Rama, the monkeys too were in great grief and wept terribly, with their eyes filled in tears, being afflicted as they were by sorrow."
Yuddha Kanda,45,26,"Those monkeys with Hanuman in first place gathered at a place and stood surrounding Rama and Lakshmana, who wee bound by a net work of arrows and lying down on the battle ground. They were disturbed and afflicted sorrow."
Yuddha Kanda,46,1,"Thereafter, surveying the earth and the sky, the monkeys beheld the brothers Rama and Lakshmana, covered with arrows."
Yuddha Kanda,46,2,"Then, along with Sugreeva, Vibhishana came to that place, after Indrajit finished his work and retired; even as Indra* would, after raining."
Yuddha Kanda,46,3,"Nila, Dvivida, Mainda, Sushena, kumuda, Angada along with Hanuman forthwith began to grieve for Rama and Lakshmana."
Yuddha Kanda,46,4,"Breathing but faintly, bathed in blood; riddled with innumerable arrows, motionless and lying inactive, they lay stretched on a bed of arrows, sighing like serpants, helpless, having little prowess, their limbs smeared with a stream of blood, resembling two golden standards, and lying on heroes' couch, those warriors with tardy movement of their limbs, were surrounded by their monkey-leaders, whose eyes were suffused with tears. Seeing the two Raghavas, pierced by a multitude of arrows, all the monkeys along with Vibhishana became perturbed."
Yuddha Kanda,46,5,"The monkeys surveyed all the quarters in the sky, without being able to discover Indrajit (the son of Ravana), who was veiled by his magic powers in the fight."
Yuddha Kanda,46,6,"Vibhishana, beholding by his magic arts, saw that nephew, standing nearby, duly hidden by his occult power."
Yuddha Kanda,46,7,"Althought that warrior who had no peer in the field and who had unique exploits, had made himself invisible by virtue of the boon he had received, he was recognized by Vibhishana, who was full of energy, glory and prowess."
Yuddha Kanda,46,8,"Contemplating his own feat, Indrajit gazed on those two warriors, stretched on the earth and in excess of joy, wishing to share it with all the demons, said."
Yuddha Kanda,46,9,"""The exceedingly strong brothers Rama and Lakshmana, the killers of Khara and Dushana have been killed by my arrows."""
Yuddha Kanda,46,10,"""Even were they aided by the gods and demons with the host of sages, these two brothers would never be able to release themselves from those arrows that paralyse them."""
Yuddha Kanda,46,11,"""This non- sensical pest, which was wearing away the very roots of us all, on whose account, the three watches of the night slipped past my father, who is unable even to touch his couch with his limbs, who remains absorbed in thought and stricken with grief and because of whom, the entire city of Lanka remains agitated, like a river during the rains, has ban destroyed by me."""
Yuddha Kanda,46,12,"""As clouds are useless in the autumn, so are all the exploits of Rama, Lakshmana and all the monkeys."""
Yuddha Kanda,46,13,"Thus speaking to all those demons, Indrajit the son of Ravana (by his arrows0 struck the monkey chief."

Yuddha Kanda,46,18,"Indrajit, that strong and highly courageous demons, pierced those jewels among the monkeys there with his arrows which resembled flames of fire and began to shout in triumph."
Yuddha Kanda,46,19,"Tormenting them with a multitude of arrows and frightening the monkeys, the mighty armed Indrajit heartily laughed and spoke (as follows)."
Yuddha Kanda,46,20,"""O, demons! At the forefront of the army, behold those two brothers (Rama and Lakshmana) bound together by me by a terrible net work of my arrows."""
Yuddha Kanda,46,21,"All those demons, the treacherous fighters on their part, after hearing the words of Indrajit, were seized with a great wonder and were overjoyed."
Yuddha Kanda,46,22,"All of them cheered Indrajit unanimously with a roar like unto thunder, crying ""Rama is dead""."
Yuddha Kanda,46,23,"Seeing the two brothers - Rama and Lakshmana lying motionless and breathless on the floor, Indrajit thought they were dead."
Yuddha Kanda,46,24,"Indrajit, full of joy and victorious in conflict, returned to Lanka, spreading happiness among the demons."
Yuddha Kanda,46,25,"Seeing Rama and Lakshmana riddle with arrows and pierced in every limb and bone of their bodies, a great fear had taken possession of Sugreeva."
Yuddha Kanda,46,26,"Vibhishana then spoke to that Sugreeva, who was frightened, whose eyes were filled with tears, looking helpless and whose eyes were agitated in grief."
Yuddha Kanda,46,27,"""Have no fear, O Sugreeva! Stay this rush of tears. Wars are like this. Victory is not certain."""
Yuddha Kanda,46,28,"""O, warrior! If a remnance of luck is there with us, the highly-souled and the exceedingly strong Rama and Lakshmana will drive off this loss of consciousness."""
Yuddha Kanda,46,29,"""O, Sugreeva! Be courageous and bring about courage in me, having no protector. For those who are devoted to truth and righteousness, there is no fear of death."""
Yuddha Kanda,46,30,"Thus speaking, Vibhishana then wiped the charming eyes of Sugreeva with his hand moistened in water."
Yuddha Kanda,46,31,"Then, the pious minded Vibhishana took water, enchanted it with an incantation and wiped the eyes of Sugreeva."
Yuddha Kanda,46,32,Having dried the face of the wise Sugreeva Vibhishana spoke the following words full of good sense and comfort.
Yuddha Kanda,46,33,"""O, Sugreeva the king of monkeys! This is not the time to cling to despondency. At this hour, even too much attachment leads to death."""
Yuddha Kanda,46,34,"""Therefore, abandoning your despair, which ruins all actions, focus now on how best to serve the troops which have Rama going before them."
Yuddha Kanda,46,35,"""Or else, let Rama be protected till he regains consciousness. Having regained consciousness, Rama and Lakshmana can indeed drive away the fear of both of us."""
Yuddha Kanda,46,36,"""This is nothing to Rama nor Rama is going to die. The bodily splendour, which is difficult to be found in those whose longevity of life has run out; is not abandoning him."""

Yuddha Kanda,46,38,"""O, the foremost of monkeys! These monkeys, having their eyes dilated due to fear, are signaling some words into each other's ear, terrified as they were."""
Yuddha Kanda,46,39,"""Let the monkeys cast off their fear, even as one would discard a used garland, on seeing me running about to activate the troops."""
Yuddha Kanda,46,40,"Having emboldened Sugreeva, Vibhishana the foremost of demons once again reassured that army of monkeys, who were pushing away."
Yuddha Kanda,46,41,"Indrajit, the great conjurer, surrounded by all his forces, re-entered the city of Lanka."
Yuddha Kanda,46,42,"Approaching Ravana there and saluting with joined palms, Indrajit informed his father in pleasing words that both Rama and Lakshmana had been slain."
Yuddha Kanda,46,43,"Hearing in the midst of demons, the news that both the enemies having been killed, Ravana forthwith sprang on his feet in joy and embraced his son."
Yuddha Kanda,46,44,"Smelling on his head, Ravana delighted at heard, made enquiries in the matter. Indrajit reported the matter as it happened, to his enquiring father, as to how both Rama and Lakshmana were made motion-less and luster-less by entwining them with arrows."
Yuddha Kanda,46,45,"Hearing the words of Indrajit the great charioteer, Ravana with his heart filled with a gush of joy, relinquished his anguish, caused on account of Rama and applauded his son with pleasing words."
Yuddha Kanda,47,1,"Indrajit, the son of Ravana having returned to Lanka, his purpose accomplished, the leading monkeys surrounded Rama in order to watch over him."

Yuddha Kanda,47,3,"Ravana, meanwhile, full of joy, dismissed his son Indrajit and thereafter summoned the female demons who guarded Seetha."
Yuddha Kanda,47,4,"Following his orders, the female-demons along with Trijata appeared before him. Then, the rejoiced Ravana said to them as follows:"

Yuddha Kanda,47,17,"On seeing those two brothers, who were filled with valour, having lotus-eyes, the excellent of men, lying streteched on a bed of arrows there in that wretched plight like the two sons of the fire-god (Shkha and Vishakha) lying on a bed of reeds, Seetha wailed piteously, stricken as she was with a great agony."

Yuddha Kanda,51,24,"As he mounted and advanced in an excellent chariot harnessed to mules, whose voices he emulated, birds of ill-omen in the sky obstructed that advancing demon of very terrible and fearful appearance."
Yuddha Kanda,51,25,"A highly terrible vulture alighted on the top of his chariot, while those devourers of corpses clustered on the point of his standard."
Yuddha Kanda,51,26,"Streming with blood, a huge decapitated trunk fell to earth, emitting inarticulate noise in Dhumraksha's vicinity and the sky rained down blood. The earth trembled."
Yuddha Kanda,51,27,"The wind with noise resembling a thunder blew adversely. Every quarter, obscured by abundant darkness, did not dazzle."
Yuddha Kanda,51,28,"Seeing those terrible amones that appeared in all their horror to the demons, Dhumraksha became perturbed. Terror seized all the demons who were advancing in front of Dhumraksha."
Yuddha Kanda,51,29,"Then, Dhumraksha, the highly terrible and strong demon, surrounded by a multitude of demons, eager to enter into combat, set out and beheld that army of a multitude of monkeys, resembling a flood, protected by the arms of Rama."
Yuddha Kanda,52,1,"Beholding the demon, Dhumraksha of terrible prowess coming forth, all the monkeys waiting for the war, roared with joy."
Yuddha Kanda,52,2,"A highly tumultuous battle was seen between those monkeys and demons, who were slaying each other, with terrible trees, lances and maces."
Yuddha Kanda,52,3,The terrible monkeys were moved down on all sides by the demons. The demon too were levelled down to the earth with trees by the monkeys.
Yuddha Kanda,52,4,"Enraged with anger, the demons, on their part, paralyzed the monkeys with sharp and frightful arrows, going as straight as wings of eagle."
Yuddha Kanda,52,5,"While being torn asunder by the demons with terrible maces, spears, hammers, frightful iron bars and variegated tridents, the mighty monkeys fearlessly accomplished their tasks with an excitement born of anger."
Yuddha Kanda,52,6,"While their bodies were split up by the tridents and their limbs broken by arrows, those leaders of monkeys took up trees and rocks there to fight."
Yuddha Kanda,52,7,"Those terribly swift monkeys, roaring aloud harassed the valiant demons at all places, by calling out their names."
Yuddha Kanda,52,8,That awful battle with all kinds of rocks and trees furnished with many branches between monkeys and demons appeared wonderful.
Yuddha Kanda,52,9,"Some demons were crushed by monkeys, who conquered fear and some blood-sucking demons vomited blood from their mouths."
Yuddha Kanda,52,10,Some demons were slashed open at their sides. Some were formed into a heap by the trees. Some others were crushed by stones and yet others torn to pieces by the monkeys teeth.
Yuddha Kanda,52,11,"With their standards crushed and broken, their swords snapped and their chariots overturned, some demons were perturbed."
Yuddha Kanda,52,12,"Crushed by the great rocks of monkeys, the earth was scattered with corpses of great elephants resembling hills and horses with their riders."
Yuddha Kanda,52,13,"The monkeys of terrific prowess rushed upon the demons, flinging themselves upon them with great bounds horizontically and vertically and scratching their faces with their sharp nails."
Yuddha Kanda,52,14,"With their faces dejected very much, their hair torn out and maddened by the smell of blood, those demons fell on the ground."
Yuddha Kanda,52,15,"Some other demons of exceeding valour, who were enraged, very much, ran up towards the monkeys to attack them with their palms having a diamond-like blow."
Yuddha Kanda,52,16,"The monkeys, receiving that sharp shock, with even a greater ferocity, crushed the demons with blows of their fists, feet teeth and trees."
Yuddha Kanda,52,17,"Seeing his army routed, Dhumraksha that lion among the demons, in his anger began to create a blood-shed of the monkeys wishing to fight."
Yuddha Kanda,52,18,"Some monkeys pierced with spears lost rivers of blood while others struck down by blows of axe, fell to the earth's surface."
Yuddha Kanda,52,19,"Some were crushed by iron bars, others torn by harpoons, some others pierced by javelins, all exhausted and lost their lives."
Yuddha Kanda,52,20,"Slain in battle by infuriated demons, some monkeys, drenched with blood, fell on the ground and some others disappeared, having been driven away."
Yuddha Kanda,52,21,"With pierced hearts, some monkeys were made to lie down on one side. Some were torn asunder by tridents that even their intestines came out."
Yuddha Kanda,52,22,"That mighty battle assumed most awful proportions in that monkeys and demons were crammed with rocks, trees and multitude of weapons."
Yuddha Kanda,52,23,"With the bow-strings as the tuneful lute, the neighing of horses as a measure rhythm and the trumpeting of elephants as the vocal music, the whole battle resembled a symphony."
Yuddha Kanda,52,24,"Dhumraksha on his part, wielding a bow in his hand and laughing at the battle-front, made those monkeys to run away to all the quarters by a shower of his arrows."
Yuddha Kanda,52,25,"Seeing the army perturbed due to tormented by Dhumraksha, Hanuman was enraged and turned towards him, taking a gigantic rock in his hands."
Yuddha Kanda,52,26,"Hanuman, who was equal in strength to his father, with his eyes inflamed with anger, flung the rock on the chariot of Dhumraksha."
Yuddha Kanda,52,27,"Beholding the befalling rock, Dhumraksha lifting his mace hurriedly, jumped down speedily from the chariot and stood there on the earth."
Yuddha Kanda,52,28,"Shattering his chariot with its wheels, its pole, its crest along with banner and bows, that rock rolled down to the ground."
Yuddha Kanda,52,29,"Thereafter, Hanuman the son of Maruta (the wind-god), after breaking the chariot, destroyed the demons with trunks of trees furnished with their branches."
Yuddha Kanda,52,30,"With their heads crushed, the demons were drenched with blood. Some others were crunched by the trees and fell down to the earth."
Yuddha Kanda,52,31,"Having driven away the army of demons, Hanuma born of Maruta, breaking off the peak of a mountain, ran towards Dhumraksha."
Yuddha Kanda,52,32,"The valiant Dhumraksha lifted his mace and making a roaring sound, ran towards that Hanuman who was rushing on him suddenly."
Yuddha Kanda,52,33,"Thereafter, Dhumraksha with an outrage, brought down that mace studded with countless spikes on the head of that Hanuma."
Yuddha Kanda,52,34,"That Hanuman, who was endowed with an energy similar to the wind, was in no way disturbed by that blow but struck Dhumraksha on the middle of his skull with his rocky peak."
Yuddha Kanda,52,35,"That Dhumraksha, struck by the rocky peak, which shattered all his limbs, soon fell down on the ground like a mountain crumbling."
Yuddha Kanda,52,36,"Seeing Dhumraksha having been killed, the demons left surviving were frightened of being killled by the monkeys and re entered Lanka."
Yuddha Kanda,52,37,"That illustrious Hanuman the son of Pavana having destroyed his enemies, causing rivers of blood to flow, weary of slaughter of the enemies, with delight, received the cordial felicitations by the monkeys."
Yuddha Kanda,53,1,"Hearing the death of Dhumraksha, Ravana the King of demons was possessed of anger and began to hiss like a serpent. Polluted by anger, with long and burning sighs, he addressed the cruel and mighty Vajradamshtra, a demon (as follows)"
Yuddha Kanda,53,2,"""O, warrior! Go ahead as the head of the demons and slay Rama the son of Dasaratha, as also Sugreeva and his monkeys!"""
Yuddha Kanda,53,3,"""So it be"" answered the leader of the demons who was a conjurer and departed with many divisions of the army that surrounded him. With the utmost attention, he assembled teams of elephants, horses mules camels and chariots adorning them with conspicuous flags and banners and he himself was well-prepared."
Yuddha Kanda,53,4,"Adorned with colourful bracelets and a diadem, Vajradamshtra set out immediately, wielding a bow and well-covered by an armour."
Yuddha Kanda,53,5,"That army-general circumambulated and ascended his chariot, duly decorated with flags and shiningly adorned with purpose."
Yuddha Kanda,53,6,"Infantry of every kind issued forth, furnished in their hands with weapons such as clubs, excellent javelins, smooth pestles, harpoons, bows, lances, spears, swords, discus, maces and sharp axes."
Yuddha Kanda,53,7,"All those excellent demons in their resplendent and coloured uniforms, full of strength and mounted on elephants furious with rut, resembled moving mountains."
Yuddha Kanda,53,8,"All those excellent demons in their resplendent and coloured uniforms, full of strength and mounted on elephants furious with rut, resembled moving mountains."
Yuddha Kanda,53,9,"That whole army of demons paraded, looking as brilliant as the clouds, with lightning and sound in the rainy season. They emerged from the southern gate where the General Angada is stationed."
Yuddha Kanda,53,10,"While those demons set forth, inauspicious portents appeared. From a cloudless yet burning sky, meteors fell. Fearful jackals, emitting their howls, belched forth flames and fire."
Yuddha Kanda,53,11,"The dreadful beasts then foretold destruction of demons, who while entering the combat, stumbled miserably."
Yuddha Kanda,53,12,"Ever after seeing these portents Vajradamshtra of exceeding prowess and sharpness, shored up courage and being fond of battle, set out for the combat."
Yuddha Kanda,53,13,"The monkeys, burning for victory, seeing their enemies advancing, made tremendous shouts which echoed every quarter."
Yuddha Kanda,53,14,"Thereafter, a tumultuous battle ensured between the monkeys and the demons, who were cruel, of ferocious form and desirous of each other's destruction."
Yuddha Kanda,53,15,"Some warriors of great energy, coming for war, their necks, and bodies severed, fell to the surface of the earth, their entire bodies bathed in blood."
Yuddha Kanda,53,16,"Some other warriors, who did not turn back in battle, with arms resembling steel, approached one another, attacking with various kinds of weapons."
Yuddha Kanda,53,17,"An extremely great and terrible noise, breaking the hearts, was heard there from trees, rocks and weapons."
Yuddha Kanda,53,18,"A terrific noise of the wheel-rims of chariots and the bow, along with the tumultuous sounds of couches, kettle-drums and tabours arose there."
Yuddha Kanda,53,19,"Some demons, leaving weapons, performed battle with their arms. The demons were beaten and their bodies made fragmented by the monkeys of fighting arrogance, with their palms, feet, fists, trees and knees. Some demons were crushed to powder with rocks."
Yuddha Kanda,53,20,"Tremendously frightening the monkeys in the battle by his arrows, Vajradamshtra moved himself in the battle-field like Yama the God of Death moving at the time of dissolution of the worlds, wielding a noose in his hand."
Yuddha Kanda,53,21,"The strong demons skilled in weaponry and wielding various kinds of weapons, killed the army of monkeys in that battle, with their increased anger."
Yuddha Kanda,53,22,"The courageous Angada the son of Vali, twice possessed of anger, killed all those demons in the battle, like a world-destroying fire."
Yuddha Kanda,53,23,"The valiant Angada with his raging red eyes lifted a tree and killed all those troop of demons, like a lion killing small animals. Angada, with his prowess resembling that of Indra the Lord of celestials, brought about a terrific destroyer of the enemies."
Yuddha Kanda,53,24,"The terribly strong demons, struck by Angada there, had their heads shattered and fell down like chopped off trees."
Yuddha Kanda,53,25,"The earth then appeared fearful, it being covered with chariots, conspicuous flags, horses, bodies of monkeys and demons with streams of blood flowing there."
Yuddha Kanda,53,26,"That battle-field, decorated with necklaces, bracelets worn on upper arm, garments and umbrellas looked like an autumnal night."
Yuddha Kanda,53,27,"By the swiftness of Angada, that great army of demons there trembled then, like a cloud by the swiftness of wind."
Yuddha Kanda,54,1,The devastation of his army through Angada's prowess filled the mighty Vajradamstra with anger.
Yuddha Kanda,54,2,"Stretching his terrific bow, like unto Indra's thunder bolt, he assailed the monkey battalions with a flood of arrows."
Yuddha Kanda,54,3,"Then, the foremost of the demons mounted on chariots, fought the battle with every kind of weapon."
Yuddha Kanda,54,4,"The monkeys, those valiant bulls among the Plavagas, assembling on all sides, fought with rocks."
Yuddha Kanda,54,5,"Then in that battle there, the demons abundantly hurled thousands of weapons on the foremost of monkeys."
Yuddha Kanda,54,6,"The monkeys of mighty prowess, resembling elephants in rut, showered down giant trees and huge lumps of rock on the demons."
Yuddha Kanda,54,7,"Between those courageous warriors, the demons and the monkeys, who never retreated in battle, a tremendous struggle ensued."
Yuddha Kanda,54,8,"Some monkeys and demons, with their shattered heads, but bereft of arms and legs, lay on the earth bathed in blood with their bodies wounded by weapons, a prey to herons vultures and crows or devoured by troops of jackals."
Yuddha Kanda,54,9,"Monkeys and demons fell on the battle-field; headless trunks leaps up to the terror of all the fearful, their limbs hacked to pieces in the combat."
Yuddha Kanda,54,10,"Thereafter, under the eyes of Vajradamshtra, all his army of demons were killed and broken up by the monkey-troops."
Yuddha Kanda,54,11,"Seeing the demons terrified with fear and decimated by the monkeys, that powerful Vajradamshtra, his eyes red with anger, bow in hand, penetrated the army of monkeys, sowing panic among them."
Yuddha Kanda,54,12,"Thereafter, in his fury, the vigorous Vajradamshtra dispatched those monkeys with arrows resembling wings of an eagle that flew straight to their target and pierced seven, eight, nine or five of his opponents simultaneously, thus destroying them."
Yuddha Kanda,54,13,"With their limbs crippled by those arrows and frightened, those monkey battalions sought refuge with Angada, as all creatures with Brahma the Lord of Creation."
Yuddha Kanda,54,14,"When he beheld those monkey troops fleeing in disorder, Angada the son Vali exchanged glances of hatred with Vajradamshtra."
Yuddha Kanda,54,15,Both Vajradamshtra and Angada fought against each other like a lion and an elephant in rut. They strolled din a tremendous fury.
Yuddha Kanda,54,16,"Thereafter, that Vajradamshtra knocked the mighty Angada at his vital organs with his arrows resembling hundred thousand flames of fire."
Yuddha Kanda,54,17,"With all his limbs drenched in blood, the mighty Angada having a terrific prowess threw a tree on Vajradamshtra."
Yuddha Kanda,54,18,"That unperplexed demon, seeing that tree falling on him, cut it into innumerable pieces which fell in heaps on earth."
Yuddha Kanda,54,19,"Witnessing the strength of Vajradamshtra, Angada that lion among the monkeys seized hold of a large rock and emitting a shout, threw it on him."
Yuddha Kanda,54,20,"As the rock descended, that vigorous Vajradamshtra leaping down from his chariot, armed with his mace, stood waiting unperplexed, on the battle-field."
Yuddha Kanda,54,21,"Meanwhile, the rock thrown by Angada, falling into the forefront of the battle, then crushed the chariot with its wheels shafts and horses"
Yuddha Kanda,54,22,"Thereafter, Angada the monkey, seizing another large peak of a mountain adorned with trees, threw it on Vajradamshtra's head."
Yuddha Kanda,54,23,"Beginning to vomit blood, Vajradamshtra became fainted, clenching his mace convulsively and breathing heavily for a moment."
Yuddha Kanda,54,24,"Regaining his consciousness, Vajradamshtra the demon was very much enraged and hit Angada full on the chest with his mace."
Yuddha Kanda,54,25,"Leaving his mace, he performed a pugilistic encounter there. Both the monkey and the demon thus hit each other in that combat."
Yuddha Kanda,54,26,"Exhausted by the blows, spitting blood, those valiant warriors were like the planets Mars and Mercury."
Yuddha Kanda,54,27,"Then, Angada the lion among the monkeys, possessing a great splendour, uprooted a tree full with many flowers and fruits and stood waiting."
Yuddha Kanda,54,28,The demon too seized hold of a shield covered with the hide of a bull as well as a great beautiful sword decorated richly with a multitude of golden bells.
Yuddha Kanda,54,29,"Thirsting for victory, the monkeys and the demons, making roaring sounds, roamed about in different ways and collided with each other."
Yuddha Kanda,54,30,"With their gaping wounds, they shone like a pair of kimshuka trees in blossom. Exhausted were both of them while fighting and they sank their knees on the earth."
Yuddha Kanda,54,31,"Angada, the foremost of the monkeys, just after a moment, with his glittering eyes, rose up like a serpent struck with a stick."
Yuddha Kanda,54,32,The mighty Angada assaulted the giant head of Vajradamshtra with a well-sharpened and stainless sword.
Yuddha Kanda,54,33,"Struck by the sword, that charming head of Vajradamshtra, with his limbs drenched in blood and eyes rolling, fell into two pieces."
Yuddha Kanda,54,34,"Seeing Vajradamshtra having been slain, the demons, deluded with fear, fled panic-stricken towards Lanka, harassed by the monkeys with their down-cast faces, their heads bowed in shame."
Yuddha Kanda,54,35,"The mighty Angada experienced a great joy amidst the monkey forces, honoured by them for his high courage and he resembled the Lord of a Thousand Eyes surrounded by the celestials."
Yuddha Kanda,55,1,"Hearing that Vajradamshtra was killed by Angada, Ravana spoke the following words to the General of his forces who, with joined palms, stood near him."
Yuddha Kanda,55,2,"""Let the invincible demons of irresistible courage go forth soon, with Akampana as their head, who is skilled in the use of every weapon and missile."""
Yuddha Kanda,55,3,"""This excellent demon is a chastiser, a protector and a leader in battle. He ever desired my welfare and always loved war."""
Yuddha Kanda,55,4,"""There is no doubt that he will prove victorious and Rama, Lakshmana, the mighty Sugreeva and the other terrible monkeys."""
Yuddha Kanda,55,5,"Taking that command of Ravana, the mighty Akampana of quick resolution then mobilized the army."
Yuddha Kanda,55,6,"Those foremost of demons of terrifying appearance, furnished with every kind of weapon and fearful to look upon, rushed into the fray where their general had dispatched them."
Yuddha Kanda,55,7,"Then, Akampana of the stature and colour of a cloud, whose voice resembled a thunder, ascended his great chariot, decorated with fine gold and set out, surrounded by dreadful demons."
Yuddha Kanda,55,8,"Even celestials were indeed unable to upset Akampana in a great battle. Hence, among the demons, he was shining like the sun, by his splendour."
Yuddha Kanda,55,9,"As he sped on his way, hastened and eager to enter the battle, the horses drawing his chariot were suddenly deprived of their energy."
Yuddha Kanda,55,10,"The left eye of Akampana, who delighted in warfare, began to twitch. His countenance grew pale and his voice trembled."
Yuddha Kanda,55,11,"At a time of a good day, marked by fine weather, it turned into a day of bad weather with a bitter wind beginning to blow. Birds and beasts uttered cruel and fearful cries."
Yuddha Kanda,55,12,"That demon, who had the shoulders of a lion and the agility of a tiger, disregarding those portents, rushed towards the battle-field."
Yuddha Kanda,55,13,"While Akampana advanced thus with his troops, an immense tumult arose that seemed to convulse the ocean."
Yuddha Kanda,55,14,"By hearing that clamour of the demons coming for the battle, the huge army of the monkeys, brandishing trees and rocks, was frightened."
Yuddha Kanda,55,15,"A highly fierce battle ensued between those monkeys and demons, who were ready to lose their lives for the sake of Rama and Ravana."
Yuddha Kanda,55,16,"All the monkeys and demons, who were willing to kill each other, were very strong and valiant. All were resembling mountains."
Yuddha Kanda,55,17,"The tremendous clamour of the aforesaid warriors, yelling in their rage and strength, making savage cries, were distinctly heard on the battle-field."
Yuddha Kanda,55,18,"A highly terrific dust, in a thick coppery colour, raised by the monkeys and demons enveloped all the ten quarters."
Yuddha Kanda,55,19,"The combatants, enveloped by that dust, which was whitish like a piece of silk shaken by the wind, could no longer distinguish each other on the battle-field."
Yuddha Kanda,55,20,"Neither standard, banner and shield, nor horse, weapon and chariot could be discerned in that pall of dust."
Yuddha Kanda,55,21,"A great tumultuous clamour, of warriors, making challenging cries and rushing upon each other, was heard on the battle-field, yet in that confusion, no form was visible."
Yuddha Kanda,55,22,"In the darkness, the greatly enraged monkeys killed the monkeys themselves and the demons killed the demons themselves in battle."
Yuddha Kanda,55,23,"Those monkeys and demons killing other and their own people then made the earth dampened with blood, anointing its body with mud."
Yuddha Kanda,55,24,"Under the stream of blood being sprinkled, the dust was laid, revealing the earth covered with bodies and corpses."
Yuddha Kanda,55,25,"The demons and the monkeys vigorously struck each other swiftly with blows from trees, spears, maces, javelins, stones, bars and picks."
Yuddha Kanda,55,26,"The monkeys of dreadful deeds, resembling mountains, fighting with their arms appearing like iron bars, killed the demons in battle."
Yuddha Kanda,55,27,"The enraged demons with darts and javelins in their hands, struck the monkeys there with their cruel weapons."
Yuddha Kanda,55,28,"The extremely enraged Akampana, the general of the army of demons, cheered all those demons by his terrible prowess."
Yuddha Kanda,55,29,"The monkeys however leaping upon them and snatching their weapons through their strength, crushed those demons with blows from large trees and stones."
Yuddha Kanda,55,30,"Meanwhile Kumuda, Nala and Mainda the courageous monkeys in an outburst of anger, displayed unsuprassed rashness."
Yuddha Kanda,55,31,"Those exceedingly valiant chiefs of monkeys, as in sport, in the battle-front, with mighty blows of trees, created a great carnage among the demons. All of them repeatedly crushed the demons with every kind of weapon."
Yuddha Kanda,56,1,"Seeing that very great exploit executed by the chiefs of monkeys in the battle, Akampana was seized with a fierce anger."
Yuddha Kanda,56,2,"Witnessing that work of the enemies, his features were distorted by anger and brandishing his powerful bow, Akampana addressed his charioteer in these words."
Yuddha Kanda,56,3,"""Drive the chariot quickly to that place, for, those monkeys are killing innumerable demons on the battle field."""
Yuddha Kanda,56,4,"""Those arrogant monkeys of terrific ferocity, armed with trees and rocks, dare to affront me here."""
Yuddha Kanda,56,5,"""I wish to kill those andicious monkeys, who are seen herassing all the army of demons."""
Yuddha Kanda,56,6,"Thereafter, in his chariot, drawn by fast-moving horses, Akampana the most skillful of chariot-warriors, with a hail of darts, assailed the monkeys from a distance."
Yuddha Kanda,56,7,"The monkeys were no longer able to maintain their formation, much less fight in the battle. all of them were crushed under the shifts of Akampana and took to their heels."
Yuddha Kanda,56,8,"Seeing those companions, getting under the sway of death pursued by Akampana's darts, the mighty Hanuman went to their rescue."
Yuddha Kanda,56,9,"Seeing Hanuman their great leader, all those valiant and the best of the monkeys together rallied and grouped themselves boldly round him."
Yuddha Kanda,56,10,"Observing Hanuman's courage, those excellent monkeys took shelter in his powerfulness and became powerfulness and became powerful indeed."
Yuddha Kanda,56,11,"Akampana, like Mahendra the Lord of celestials, assailed a hail of arrows on Hanuman, who remained as firm as a rock."
Yuddha Kanda,56,12,"Heedless of the flood of weapons that fell upon his body, the mighty Hanuman resolved in his mind to slay Akampana."
Yuddha Kanda,56,13,"Laughing heartily , that Hanuman, the son of Maruta the wind-god and possessing a great splendour, leapt on the demon, causing the earth to shake as it were."
Yuddha Kanda,56,14,"As he roared burning with energy, the form of Hanuman became difficult to overpower, like a blazing fire."
Yuddha Kanda,56,15,"Knowing himself to be bereft of any weapon, Hanuman the excellent monkey, with a rage, uplifted a mountain quickly."
Yuddha Kanda,56,16,"That valiant Hanuman, seizing a very great mountain with one hand and letting up a roar, began to spin it rapidly."
Yuddha Kanda,56,17,"Thereafter, as formerly in an encounter Indra the Lord of celestials hurled his thunderbolt at Namuchi, Hanuman rushed towards Akampana."
Yuddha Kanda,56,18,"Beholding that crag flying towards him, Akampana shattered it even from a distance by means of his great crescent-shaped arrows."
Yuddha Kanda,56,19,"Seeing that rocky peak shatterd in the air by the demon's arrows and falling in pieces, Hanuman became mad with anger."
Yuddha Kanda,56,20,"Approaching an Ashwakarna tree as large as a mountain, in the transport of rage that possessed him, that Hanuman uprooted it speedily."
Yuddha Kanda,56,21,"Taking hold of that Ashvakarna tree with large branches, in his great strength, Hanuman with immense delight spinned it, while standing on the ground."
Yuddha Kanda,56,22,"Then, the highly enraged Hanuman began to run with great strides, breaking down the trees by his strength and tearing up the earth with his feet."
Yuddha Kanda,56,23,Hanuman struck down elephants as also who rode upon them and charioteers with their chariots and the terrific infantry of demons.
Yuddha Kanda,56,24,"Seeing that Hanuman, like unto Yama the Destroyer of vital Breaths, full of wrath armed with a tree and taking off lives, the demons took of flight."
Yuddha Kanda,56,25,"The valiant Akampana, beholding that Hanuman who was enraged and rushing on, sowing terror among his soldiers, was greatly perturbed and set up a mighty shout."
Yuddha Kanda,56,26,"With fourteen sharp arrows that tore the flesh, that Akampana pierced the highly valiant Hanuman."
Yuddha Kanda,56,27,"Riddled with sharp-pointed shafts, that warrior Hanuman appeared like a mountain on which a number of plants shooted up."
Yuddha Kanda,56,28,That mighty Hanuman of great strength with a large body shone like a fire without smoke and resembled a blooming Ashoka tree.
Yuddha Kanda,56,29,"Thereafter, showing a great haste in uprooting another tree, Hanuman struck the head of Akampana the General of demons."
Yuddha Kanda,56,30,"Struck with a tree by that high-souled and enraged Hanuman, that demon fell down and died."
Yuddha Kanda,56,31,"Seeing their leader Akampana lying lifeless on earth, all the demons trembled as the trees do during an earthquake."
Yuddha Kanda,56,32,"All those defeated warriors, throwing their arms, escaped in the direction of Lanka, terrified, pursued by those monkeys."
Yuddha Kanda,56,33,"Their hair loosened, bewildered, their pride broken by defeat, their limbs dripping with sweat, those demons fled, blowing out their breaths."
Yuddha Kanda,56,34,"Mad with fear, looking back again and again and crushing each other in haste, they entered the city."
Yuddha Kanda,56,35,"When those demons had entered Lanka, all the mighty monkeys approached Hanuman and paid homage to him."
Yuddha Kanda,56,36,"That Hanuman, of noble nature honoured all those delighted monkeys, in accord with their rank and the occasion."
Yuddha Kanda,56,37,The triumphant monkeys shouted in accord with their nighty and once again dragged the demons who were still alive there on the battle-field.
Yuddha Kanda,56,38,"That great monkey, born of Maruta having encountered and killed the demons, enjoyed the same renown as Vishnu when he overcame the mighty and terrific demon of immense power destroying his enemies in the forefront of the battle."
Yuddha Kanda,56,39,"Then, the troops of deities along with Rama himself, the exceedingly strong Lakshmana, Sugreeva and other monkeys and the mighty Vibhishana paid homage to Hanuman."
Yuddha Kanda,57,1,"Hearing of Akampana's killing, Ravana the Lord of demons, with a little depressed face, was enraged and looked towards his ministers."
Yuddha Kanda,57,2,"Having reflected awhile and deliberated with his ministers, Ravana the king of Demons then passed that forenoon in inspecting his defenses in the City of Lanka."
Yuddha Kanda,57,3,"The king Ravana saw that City, guarded by groups of demons, filled with innumerable troops and decorated with banners and flags."
Yuddha Kanda,57,4,"Seeing Lanka besieged, Ravana the Lord of Demons spoke as follows to Prahasta who was skilled in war-fare and who wished well of him even at a critical time."
Yuddha Kanda,57,5,"""O, Prahasta the proficient in war-free! I do not see any other deliverance than a battle for this city, which is besieged suddenly and being devastated."""
Yuddha Kanda,57,6,"""Either myself or Kumbhakarna or yourself my army-chief or Indrajit or Nikumbha and none else could undertake such a task!"""
Yuddha Kanda,57,7,"""For that reason, taking a company of warriors, you quickly place yourself in their midst and set forth in order to triumph over all those monkeys."""
Yuddha Kanda,57,8,"""Unsettled in no time on knowing your decision to enter the battle-field, the army of monkeys will run away on hearing the raring sound of the leaders of demons."""
Yuddha Kanda,57,9,"""The monkeys are unsteady, mis-behaved and fickle-minded. They do not tolerate your sound, as elephants the lion's roar."""
Yuddha Kanda,57,10,"""O, Prahasta! As that army takes to its heels, Rama along with Lakshmana being supportless, will fall into your power though unwillingly."""
Yuddha Kanda,57,11,"""A skeptical misfortune is preferable to one that is certain! Whether it is unpleasing to hear or not, say what you consider as an advantage to us."""
Yuddha Kanda,57,12,"Hearing the words of Ravana, Prahasta the Army-General spoke the following words to Ravana, like Ushana the preceptor of demons would speak to Bali, the king of demons."
Yuddha Kanda,57,13,"O, king! Formerly, we deliberated this matter with our wise ministers and, after having a good dialogue with each other, a disagreement arose between us."""
Yuddha Kanda,57,14,"""To return Seetha was what I considered preferable. Not to do so meant war; we foresaw this."""
Yuddha Kanda,57,15,"""I have ever been honoured by you at appropriate times by gifts, felicitations and nice words. When the opportunity arises, is it not for me to render you a service?"""
Yuddha Kanda,57,16,"""Neither wives nor sons nor riches are going to be spared by me. See you me, intending to sacrifice my life for your sake in the battle."""
Yuddha Kanda,57,17,"Having spoken thus to Lord Ravana, the General Prahasta said to his leading officers who stood before him as follows:"
Yuddha Kanda,57,18,"""Gather a large army of demons together for me. Today, the flesh-eating birds and beasts shall feed on the enemy that I strike down on the battle-field with my swift arrows."""
Yuddha Kanda,57,19,"Hearing that command of Prahasta, the mighty leaders of the army assembled the forces in the abode of that demon."
Yuddha Kanda,57,20,"Within a short while, that City of Lanka was filled with those terrific demon-warriors, resembling elephants and wielding various types of weaponry."
Yuddha Kanda,57,21,"While some demons propitiated the fire-god with their offerings and paid homage to Brahmanas, a fragrant freeze bearing the scent of clarified butter, began to blow."
Yuddha Kanda,57,22,"Then, the demons who were ready for the battle, delightedly wore garlands of different shapes, consecrated by certain Mantras (sacred formulas)."
Yuddha Kanda,57,23,"Thereafter, armed with bows and armours, the demons with their eyes turned towards their king Ravana, marched at a brisk pace and ranged themselves round Prahasta."
Yuddha Kanda,57,24,"Then, Prahasta who got ready with his weapons and armour, after bidding obeisance to the king and striking a terrible kettle-drum, mounted his chariot, which was kept ready, yoked to an extremely swift horses, well controlled by a charioteer, emanating a noise resembling that of a large cloud, actually shining like moon-light, inviolable with a flag bearing an ensign of snake, with a good collision-guard, with nice wheels and decorated with a net of pure gold smiling as it were in its magnificence."
Yuddha Kanda,57,25,"Then, Prahasta the one who was commanded by Ravana, ascended his chariot and set out from Lanka soon along with a huge army."
Yuddha Kanda,57,26,"While Prahasta the general sallied forth, the sound of a kettle-drum, the resonance of musical instruments and the sound of conches were heard, as though filling the earth like the roar of a cloud."
Yuddha Kanda,57,27,"The demons with terrific forms and bulky bodies, shouting with dreadful voices, went in front, as forerunners of Prahasta."
Yuddha Kanda,57,28,"Narantaka, Kumbhahanu, Mahanada and Samunnata, attendants of Prahasta sallied forth, surrounding him on all sides."
Yuddha Kanda,57,29,"He emerged from the eastern gate in the midst of an immense, formidable and orderly arranged army, resembling a herd of elephants."
Yuddha Kanda,57,30,"In the centre of that army, vast as the sea, that Prahasta in his fury, came forth appearing like Death at the end of the world."
Yuddha Kanda,57,31,The uproar that arose on his setting forth with his demons raising the war-cries drew sinister answering calls from all creatures in Lanka.
Yuddha Kanda,57,32,"In a cloudless sky, birds of prey eating flesh and blood, flew in circles from left to right towards the chariot."
Yuddha Kanda,57,33,"Fearful jackals vomited forth fire and flames, howling repeatedly. A meteor fell from the sky and the wind blew harshly."
Yuddha Kanda,57,34,"The plants, in opposition to each other, lost their brilliance. The clouds, with their raucous sound, showered blood on Prahasta's chariot and dampened those who were walking in front of it."
Yuddha Kanda,57,35,"A vulture facing the south alighted on the top of the standard, croaking towards both of its sides and deprived the demon of his entire lustre."
Yuddha Kanda,57,36,"The goad fell several times then from the hand of the charioteer, himself a Suta (the son of a Kshatriya by a Brahamana woman) eventhough skilled in controlling the horses, as he entered the battle-field."
Yuddha Kanda,57,37,That rarely splendour which clothed Prahasta at the time of his exit vanished in an instant and horses stumbled on the even ground.
Yuddha Kanda,57,38,"Beholding that Prahasta, renowned for his excellences and martial valour; as he advanced to give battle, the army of monkeys went forward to attack him."
Yuddha Kanda,57,39,"Thereafter, an exceedingly tumultuous clamour arose among the monkeys as they tore up the trees and seized hold of huge rocks."
Yuddha Kanda,57,40,"Both the armies of the yelling demons and the roaring monkeys were delighted, impetuous and powerful with impatience to slay each other and challenging each other with great shouts."
Yuddha Kanda,57,41,"Thereafter, the evil-minded Prahasta sallied forth for victory towards the army of Sugreeva, whom in his folly, imagined he would destroy, with an accelerated speed as a grass-hopper rushes towards a flame."
Yuddha Kanda,58,1,"Seeing Prahasta setting out with a martial ardour, Rama the conqueror of enemies, smiling, spoke to Vibhishana as follows:"
Yuddha Kanda,58,2,"""Who is he with a very huge body, coming with a great speed along with a large army? O, the mighty armed! Tell me about this strong demon."""
Yuddha Kanda,58,3,"Hearing Rama's words, Vibhishana replied as follows ""He is guarded by two-thirds of the army of Lanka. He is a demon of prowess, skilled in the use of mystic weapons and valiant. He is the demon named Prahasta, the Army general of Ravana."""
Yuddha Kanda,58,4,"That huge and powerful army of monkeys, who began to emit cries of defiance with fury, thereupon saw the terrible Prahasta of formidable exploits coming forth towards them."
Yuddha Kanda,58,5,"Swords, lances, daggers, darts, spears, clubs, maces bars, barbed missiles, various kinds of axes and different bows glittered in the hands of demons, who were running up towards the monkeys and seeking victory."
Yuddha Kanda,58,6,"The monkeys who were burning to fight took hold of trees in flower, rocks and lofty and thick stones."
Yuddha Kanda,58,7,"As they approached each other, a very great battle arose between those combatants who showered down a hail of arrows and a bombardment of stones."
Yuddha Kanda,58,8,"In that battle, many of the demons killed several excellent monkeys and several monkeys killed many of the demons."
Yuddha Kanda,58,9,Some monkeys were smashed by spears and some others by finer weapons. Some were struck by iron bars and some others were slit by axes.
Yuddha Kanda,58,10,"Yet again, some fell breathlessly on the ground and some were destroyed by the arrows aimed at them with their hearts splits asunder."
Yuddha Kanda,58,11,"Cut into two with the strokes of swords by those powerful demons, some monkeys, trembling, fell on the earth, their sides torn open."
Yuddha Kanda,58,12,Even the flock of demons on all sides were crushed on to the earth by the furious monkeys with tree and mountain-peaks.
Yuddha Kanda,58,13,"Having been administered thundering slaps with their hands and terrific blows with their fists, the faces and eyes of demons were were lacerated. The demons vomited plenty of blood from their months."
Yuddha Kanda,58,14,"A tumultuous clamour arose among monkeys and demons, as cries of pain and leonine roars were bellowed."
Yuddha Kanda,58,15,"The monkeys and the demons with anger, following the path of heroes, with their cruel and hostile eyes, accomplished their deeds with great courage."
Yuddha Kanda,58,16,"Narantaka Kumbhahanu, Mahanada and Samunnata all these companions of Prahasta killed the monkeys."
Yuddha Kanda,58,17,"Dvivida, with a mountain-peak, struck down Narantaka, the one among them who was rushing upon quickly and killing the monkeys."
Yuddha Kanda,58,18,"The ape Durmukha on his part, with a ready hand, uprooted a very large tree and crushed the demon Samunnata."
Yuddha Kanda,58,19,The energetic Jambavan with a great fury seized a huge rock and threw it on the chest-region of Mahanada.
Yuddha Kanda,58,20,"Then, the valiant Kumbhahanu there in the battle, having attacked the General Tara, who was armed with a huge tree, received a blow immediately cost him his life."
Yuddha Kanda,58,21,"Not tolerating the aforesaid act, Prahasta having occupied his chariot with bow in hand, caused a terrible havoc among the monkeys."
Yuddha Kanda,58,22,"Then, with the rapid movement of both the armies, there arose of clamour resembling the roar of an unfathomable and tempestuous ocean in a time of dissolution."
Yuddha Kanda,58,23,"The demon Prahasta, who was hard to be subdued in battle, with full of anger, tormented the monkeys by an immense avalanche of arrows in that great combat."
Yuddha Kanda,58,24,"By the frightening corpses of monkeys and demons, appearing like hideous mountains, a very extensive area of the ground is covered."
Yuddha Kanda,58,25,"That ground, covered by the stream of blood, shone as in the month of spring when overspread fully with the bloossoming crimson-coloured Palasa flowers."
Yuddha Kanda,58,26,"With the heaps of warriors for its banks the broken weapons its trees, the torrents of blood its huge waves, death appeared like an ocean receiving its floods, livers and spleens its mire, entrails its moss, severed heads and trunks the fish, and morsels of flesh the grass, the innumerable vultures its lovely swans, herons its geese, covered as it was with fat for the foam, the tumult the sound of its waters, the battle field resembled a river, incapable of being crossed by cowards, visited by water-fowls at the end of the rainy season, those demons and the foremost of the monkeys crossed over that impassable river, as elephants lead their herds across a lake that the lotuses have covered with pollen."
Yuddha Kanda,58,27,"Then, Nila saw Prahasta who was employing a multitude of arrows sitting in the chariot and annihilating the monkeys swiftly."
Yuddha Kanda,58,28,"Seeing Nila who was running towards him in the battle-field, as a rocking wind in the sky rushes towards a large massive clouds, Prahasta the Army general attacked Nila himself with his chariot having the sun's colour."
Yuddha Kanda,58,29,"That Prahasta the Army General, who was excellent among the wielders of bow, drew the bow-string and hurled the arrows towards Nila in that great battle."
Yuddha Kanda,58,30,"Those arrows with a great speed resembling furious snakes employed by Prahasta proceeded towards Nila, pierced him and fell on the ground."
Yuddha Kanda,58,31,"That great ape of prowess Nila, who was struck by sharp arrows resembling flames, uprooted a tree and thumped it on the descending Prahasta who was most difficult to be assaulted."
Yuddha Kanda,58,32,"Being unable to restrain the series of arrows hurled at him by that evil-minded demon, nila received them with closed eyes."
Yuddha Kanda,58,33,"Like a bull standing under a sudden autumnal down-pour, so under that intolerable and sudden rain of darts released by Prahasta, Nila endured with closed eyes though it was scarce to be endured."
Yuddha Kanda,58,34,"The exceedingly strong and the great Nila, enraged over the volley of darts, killed Prahasta's horses by hurling a huge Sala tree on them."
Yuddha Kanda,58,35,Thereafter the greatly enraged Nila quickly broke the bow of Prahasta the evil-minded demon and shouted again and again.
Yuddha Kanda,58,36,"Deprived of his bow, Prahasta the leader of the army, seizing a formidable mace, leapt down from the chariot."
Yuddha Kanda,58,37,"Those two army-chiefs, who were courageous and in whom enmity had sprung up, with their limbs covered with blood, wee standing like two elephants in rut."
Yuddha Kanda,58,38,"Lion and tiger in gait, lion and tiger in gestures, those two warriors tore each other with their shap teeth. Vanquishers of other heroes and intrepid combatants, both of them, thirsting for fame, resembled Vritra and Indra."
Yuddha Kanda,58,39,"Then, that Prahasta exerting himself well struck Nila on his forehead with a mace and blood oozed from his forehead."
Yuddha Kanda,58,40,"Whereupon, that great ape, his limbs smeared with blood, seized a huge tree and struck Prahasta full in his chest with fury."
Yuddha Kanda,58,41,"Ignoring that blow, he seized a huge mace and ran in strength towards Nila the strong monkey."
Yuddha Kanda,58,42,"Seeing Prahasta of terrible velocity briskly rushing towards him, Nila the great monkey took a huge rock swiftly."
Yuddha Kanda,58,43,Nila quickly hurled that rock on the head of Prahasta who was longing for war and fighting with a mace in the battle.
Yuddha Kanda,58,44,"Then, that huge and terrific rock hurled by Nila the leader of the monkeys broke Prahasa's head into myriad pieces."
Yuddha Kanda,58,45,"That Prahasta who lost his breath, was disfigured and dead, bereft of his senses and at once fell on the ground like a tree cut up by the root."
Yuddha Kanda,58,46,"A lot of blood oozed from his broken head. From his body two, blood streamed forth like a cascade from a mountain."
Yuddha Kanda,58,47,"Thier leader having been slain by Nila that unshakable and large army of demons, becoming disconsolated, withdrew to Lanka."
Yuddha Kanda,58,48,"Thier chief of Army having been killed, those demons could not continue to stand firmy there, any more than water on reaching a breached bridge."
Yuddha Kanda,58,49,"That Prahasta the chief of Army having been slain, those demons dumb dispirited and inactive, regained the abode of their king. They became unconscious as it were plunged in an ocean of burning grief."
Yuddha Kanda,58,50,"The triumphant Nila, however, was honoured by Rama and Lakshmana for his task well accomplished and experienced supreme joy."
Yuddha Kanda,59,1,"While Prahasta the Army chief of demons was slain in the battle by Nila the foremost among the monkeys, Ravana's army possessing terrible arms took to flight with the speed of a tide."
Yuddha Kanda,59,2,"The demons went and told Ravana that Prahasta the Army chief had been killed by Nila the son of Fire-god. Hearing those words of the demons, Ravana was possessed of anger."
Yuddha Kanda,59,3,"Hearing that Prahasta had perished in the fight, Ravana was afflicted with anger and his heart filled with grief and he addressed the foremost of his leaders as Indra the Lord of celestials to the leaders of the celestial troops (as follows):"
Yuddha Kanda,59,4,"""That enemy is not to be despised; under whose blows the destroyer of Indra's host the leader of my army with his followers and elephants fell."""
Yuddha Kanda,59,5,"""I myself shall go to that wonderful battle-front without hesitation in order to destroy the enemies and to gain victory."""
Yuddha Kanda,59,6,"""As a forest is consumed by blazing fires, so shall I scorch that army of monkeys now along with Lakshmana and Rama with a multitude of arrows. Today, I shall satiate the earth with the blood of the monkeys."""
Yuddha Kanda,59,7,"Speaking thus, Ravana the enemy of the Lord of celestials ascended his chariot which shone like a flame and was yoked to a team of excellent horses with its brilliance of an effulgent body."
Yuddha Kanda,59,8,"Ravana the best among the kings of demons sallied forth with the sound of couches, kettle-drums, cymbals, clapping of hands and leonine roars and well-acclaimed by agreeable encomiums."
Yuddha Kanda,59,9,That Ravana along with the flesh-eating demons whose forms resembled mountains and clouds and whose glances flashed like torches shone like Rudra the Lord of Immortals surrounded by genii.
Yuddha Kanda,59,10,"Ravana who was endowed with extraordinary energy, issuing all at once from the city, observed a ferocious army of monkeys with trees and rocks in their hands, ready for combat and roaring like a vast ocean and a mass of thunder-clouds."
Yuddha Kanda,59,11,"Seeing that army of demons who were excessively furious, Rama whose arms resembled great serpents, accompanied by his forces and having great fortune, spoke to Vibhishana the best among the wielders of weapons (as follows):"
Yuddha Kanda,59,12,"""Who is in command of this army, furnished with every kind of standard, banner and canopy, armed with javelins, swords, stakes and other weapons and missiles and composed of imperturbable soldiers and elephants as high as the Mahendra Mountain?"""
Yuddha Kanda,59,13,"Hearing the words of Rama, Vibhishana the equal of Indra in valour, then narrated to Rama about the choicest army of the foremost among demons of the highest peculiarity (as follows):"
Yuddha Kanda,59,14,"""O Prince! That hero who has a face with a coppery hue resembling a newly rising sun, coming on the back of an elephant causing its head to sway, know him to be Akampana."""
Yuddha Kanda,59,15,"""He who, standing in his chariot, brandish his bow which has a splendour of Indra's bow, whose standard bears the image of a lion, and who shines like unto an elephant with its terrible curved tusks, he is Indrajit who is renowned for the boons he had received from Brahma."""
Yuddha Kanda,59,16,"""He who, the archer like unto the Vindhya, Asta or Mahendra Mountains, standing in his chariot, a mighty warrior, of superior strength, who wields a bow of unequalled size and having an exceedingly grown body, he is called Atikaya."""
Yuddha Kanda,59,17,"""He who, with tawny eyes resembling the dawn, riding an elephant with its bells jangling, who is shouting aloud, he is that strong demon of the highest peculiarity is called Mahodara."""
Yuddha Kanda,59,18,"""He who, ascending the brilliantly caparisoned horse raising high a gleaming javelin, possesses a velocity of a well-directed thunder-bolt and resembles a mass of evening clouds and a mountain, he is Pishacha."""
Yuddha Kanda,59,19,"""He who, seizing a sharp spike with a possesses the velocity of a well-directed thunder bolt and comes mounting on an excellent bull which shines like a moon, he is the illustrious Trishiras."""
Yuddha Kanda,59,20,"""The other resembling a thunder-bolt, of large and well-developed chest, who has an attentive mind, has the King of Snakes as his standard, who is moving and twanging his bow, he is Kumbha."""
Yuddha Kanda,59,21,"""He who, holding a mace decorated with gold and diamonds, which are radiant (as fire) and also smoky (studded with sapphires), who advances as a standard bearer tot he army of demons, he is Nikumbha of Prodigious exploits."""
Yuddha Kanda,59,22,"""He who, mounted in a chariot, adorned with flags, gleaming like a glowing blazer, who is furnished with bows swords and a multitude of arrows, he is Narantaka who shines brightly over there and who, in combat, fights with mountain-tops."""
Yuddha Kanda,59,23,"""He who, surrounded by ghosts of dreadful form of rolling eyes, with heads of tigers, buffalo mighty elephants, deer and horses, under an excellent white canopy with slender ribs and shining like a moon, he who is the humbler of the gods themselves, shining like unto Rudra amidst the genii, is the suzerain Lord of Demons there."""
Yuddha Kanda,59,24,"""Ravana, decked with a diadem, who has brought Indra the Lord of celestials and Vaivasvata the Lord of Death low, is shining like the sun. His countenance is graced by ear-rings. His formidable stature equals the Vindhya the Lord of Mountains."""
Yuddha Kanda,59,25,"Then, Rama the annihilator of enemies, answered Vibhishana and said ""Alas! What glory, what majesty is Ravana's the Lord of Demons!"
Yuddha Kanda,59,26,"""Ravana is beaming like the sun with his rays difficult to be gazed, neither can the eye rest on him such is the binding strength of his magnificence!"""
Yuddha Kanda,59,27,"""The body of celestial or demonical heroes may not be so radiant in this manner as this body of the king of demons."""
Yuddha Kanda,59,28,"""All the warriors of the suzerain Ravana are as high as hills. All fight with mountains. All wield fiery weapons."""
Yuddha Kanda,59,29,"""Amidst the fiery ghosts of terrible aspect, this king of demons shines like Yama the Lord of Death surrounded by blazing genii endowed with hideous forms."""
Yuddha Kanda,59,30,"""By good luck, that wretch comes today within my range of sight! Today, I shall expunge my wrath, born of Seetha's abduction!"""
Yuddha Kanda,59,31,"Having spoken thus, the valiant Rama who was accompanied by Lakshmana, took up his bow and then standing erect, drew out an excellent arrow."
Yuddha Kanda,59,32,"Thereafter, that powerful Ravana spoke to those exceedingly strong demons as follows: ""Take up your positions unfalteringly and happily at the gates and principal exits, the outposts and fortifications."""
Yuddha Kanda,59,33,"""Learning of my presence along with you here, taking this to be a weak point and storming this desolate city which is otherwise difficult to be overpowered, the monkeys when united may destroy it by surprise."""
Yuddha Kanda,59,34,"Having dismissed those counsellors and as the demons departed as ordered, Ravana thereafter began to split under the waters of the sea of monkeys, in the same way as a gigantic fish would rend the entire expanse of the sea."
Yuddha Kanda,59,35,"Seeing Ravana with his radiant bow, in the battle, Sugreeva the Lord of Monkeys tearing up a huge mountain-top, ran towards that king of demons."
Yuddha Kanda,59,36,"Seizing a mountain-top with its many trees and ridges, Sugreeva hurled it on Ravana the demon. Seeing that mountain-top coming towards him, Ravana quickly broke it asunder with his arrows with golden shafts."
Yuddha Kanda,59,37,"While that mountain-top with its well-developed ridges and excellent trees was rent asunder and fell on the earth, Ravana like unto another Yama the Lord of Death, loosed an arrow resembling a great serpent."
Yuddha Kanda,59,38,"The enraged Ravana, taking that arrow with the speed of a thunder bolt of Indra the Lord of celestials and possessing the brilliance of a fire, hurled it to kill Sugreeva."
Yuddha Kanda,59,39,"That arrow released by Ravana's arm reached Sugreeva, having a bodily splendour equal to that of Indra's thunder bolt, and pierced his body in its flight as formerly Guha's spear when he discharged it at the Krauncha Mountain."
Yuddha Kanda,59,40,"Wounded by that arrow, which bereft him of consciousness, that warrior fell moaning to the earth. Beholding him falling on the ground, deprived of his senses in the battle-field, the demons raised a shout of triumph."
Yuddha Kanda,59,41,"Then, Gavaksha, Gavaya, Sushena, Rishabha, Jyotimukha and Nala; of exceeding corpulence tearing up rocks, rushed towards Ravana."
Yuddha Kanda,59,42,"That Lord of Demons, with hundreds of arrows, possessed of sharp points, rendered their projectiles fruitless and pierced those leaders of the monkeys with a multitude of marvellous golden shafted arrows."
Yuddha Kanda,59,43,"Pierced by the arrows of Ravana the Enemy of Gods, those monkey-Generals of terrifying stature fell on the ground. Thereupon, he covered that formidable army of monkeys with a shower of arrows."
Yuddha Kanda,59,44,"Assailed and fallen down, those monkey-warriors, emitted cries as though struck by an arrow of terror, whom Ravana was destroying with his darts and fled for refuge to Rama who is capable of affording protection to all."
Yuddha Kanda,59,45,"Then the high-souled Rama the skilful archer, taking his bow, set out at once. Lakshmana, however, approaching him with joined palms, spoke very meaningful words follows:"
Yuddha Kanda,59,46,"""O, noble Brother! Of my own accord, I am able to kill this wretched Ravana. O, Lord! I shall slay him. Permit me to do so."""
Yuddha Kanda,59,47,"The exceedingly powerful and the truly courageous Rama spoke to that Lakshmana as follows: ""Go, Lakshmana and also be strenuous in this duel."""
Yuddha Kanda,59,48,"""Ravana is endowed with great strength and possesses an outstanding prowess during a war. The Three Worlds themselves could not withstand his fury. There is no doubt about it."""
Yuddha Kanda,59,49,"""Seek out his weak points and guard against your own. Defend yourself vigilantly with your eye and bow."""
Yuddha Kanda,59,50,"Hearing the words of Rama, Lakshmana embraced him, thereafter offering obeisance and bidding him farewell, he entered the battle-field."
Yuddha Kanda,59,51,"Lakshmana then saw Ravana with arms as large as the trunks of elephants, who was brandishing his dreadful and fiery bow, covering those monkeys whose bodies he had severed with a close rain of darts."
Yuddha Kanda,59,52,"The exceedingly energetic Hanuma, born of Maruta the god of wind, beholding this, rushed on Ravana in order to bring that rain of arrows to an end."
Yuddha Kanda,59,53,"Approaching his chariot, the sagacious Hanuma lifted his right arm and spoke the following threatening words to Ravana:"
Yuddha Kanda,59,54,"""You have obtained the boon of invulnerability to the celestials, demons, celestial musicians, ogres and semi-divine beings. But monkeys are a danger to you."""
Yuddha Kanda,59,55,"""This five-branched right hand of mine, which I now raise, will rob you of your life that has long been resident in your body."""
Yuddha Kanda,59,56,"Hearing the words of Hanuma, the exceedingly valiant Ravana, his eyes inflamed with anger, answered."
Yuddha Kanda,59,57,"""Strike quickly without fear, O Monkey! Win eternal renown. Thereafter, I shall destroy you, after measuring your strength."""
Yuddha Kanda,59,58,"Hearing the words of Ravana, Hanuma the son of wind-god spoke the following words: ""Recollect that I have killed your son Aksha already."""
Yuddha Kanda,59,59,"Thus spoken, the highly energetic and the valiant Ravana the Lord of Demons struck Hanuma the son of Anila a violent blow on his chest with the palm of his hand."
Yuddha Kanda,59,60,"Hanuma, thus struck with Ravana's palm, reeled repeatedly. Thereafter the highly sagacious and illustrious Hanuma secured his balance within a moment and in fury, struck Ravana the enemy of Immortals with the very palm of his hand."
Yuddha Kanda,59,61,Under the violent impact of the blow of the mighty Hanuma Ravana shook like a mountain when the earth trembles.
Yuddha Kanda,59,62,"Beholding Ravana struck in the fight by Hanuma's palm; the sages, monkeys, semi-divine beings, along with celestials and demons raised a resounding approbation."
Yuddha Kanda,59,63,"Then, the extremely spirited Ravana, having regained his breath, spoke the following words: ""Well done! Well done! O, monkey! You are my adversary, worthy of praise by your valour!"""
Yuddha Kanda,59,64,"Then, Hanuma answered, ""O, Ravana! Cursed by that strength since you do still survive!"""
Yuddha Kanda,59,65,"""O, foolish fellow! Why this boasting? Now come, strike me once! My fist is about to dispatch you to the Abode of Yama the Lord of Death!"""
Yuddha Kanda,59,66,"Hearing the words of Hanuma, the powerful Ravana, enraged, his eyes red with fury and whirling his fist with force knocked it down violently on Hanuma's chest."
Yuddha Kanda,59,67,"Under the shock, Hanuma reeled once again. Seeing that mighty Hanuma exhausted, Ravana turned his chariot towards Nila."
Yuddha Kanda,59,68,"With his terrific arrows in the likeness of serpents, Ravana the powerful Lord of Demons pierced the vital parts of his enemy, thus overwhelming Nila the Monkey-general."
Yuddha Kanda,59,69,"Nila, the Army General of Monkeys, tormented by that hail of arrows, with one hand hurled a great rock at Ravana the king of demons."
Yuddha Kanda,59,70,"Meanwhile, Hanuma of exalted mind, burning with courage, regained his breath and in his martial ire cried out furiously towards Ravana, the Lord of Demons who occupied in fight with Nila as follows: ""It is not proper to engage in a combat with a person who is already doing a fight with another."""
Yuddha Kanda,59,71,"Then, the mighty Ravana, however, shattered the rock hurled by Nila with seven pointed arrows and it fell down, crumbling to pieces."
Yuddha Kanda,59,72,"Seeing that rock crumbling to pieces, Nila the Army-general the destroyer of enemies who resembled the Fire of Time, glowed with fury."
Yuddha Kanda,59,73,"In that fight, Nila hurled Aswakarna trees, Shala trees with extensive flowering, Chuta trees and other various types of trees."
Yuddha Kanda,59,74,"Ravana, confronting those trees, bursted them and showered a hail of dangerous darts on Nila the son of Fire-God."
Yuddha Kanda,59,75,"Showered by a multitude of shafts, as from a cloud, the mighty Nila assumed a diminutive form and leapt on to the point of Ravana's standard."
Yuddha Kanda,59,76,"Seeing Nila the son of Fire-God standing well on the point of his standard, Ravana inflamed with fury. Then, Nila shouted loudly."
Yuddha Kanda,59,77,"Beholding that monkey sometimes leaping on to the point of Ravana's standard sometimes on to the tip of his bow and sometimes on to the peak of his diadem, Lakshmana, Hanuma and Rama were astonished."
Yuddha Kanda,59,78,"The mighty Ravana, amazed at the monkey's agility, seized a marvellous and glowing arrow called Agneya the weapon of Fire."
Yuddha Kanda,59,79,"Thereafter, those monkeys who felt rejoiced to see Ravana disconcerted at the agility of Nila and had found an occasion for jubilation, shouted joyously."
Yuddha Kanda,59,80,"Then, provoked by the shouts of the monkeys, his heart possessed with confusing, Ravana did not know what to do."
Yuddha Kanda,59,81,"Ravana the demon, taking up an arrow, charged with the missile presided over by the fire-God, aimed at Nila who had perched on the tip of his standard."
Yuddha Kanda,59,82,"Then, Ravana the king of demons said,: ""O monkey! You are endowed with agility combined with a supreme power of magic."""
Yuddha Kanda,59,83,"""Do you save your life if you can, eventhogh you are creating numerous deeds of various kinds indeed worthy of your own self, O, monkey!"""
Yuddha Kanda,59,84,"""Even then, the arrow charged with a mystic missile I am about to loose, will severe you from life, which existence you seek to preserve."""
Yuddha Kanda,59,85,"Thus speaking, Ravana the long-armed King of Demons, having placed Agni Missile with his arrow, struck Nila the Army-General."
Yuddha Kanda,59,86,"Struck on the chest by the arrow combined with a missile, Nila being burnt all over, suddenly fell to the ground."
Yuddha Kanda,59,87,"Yet by virtue of the powerful aid of his father and his own native vigour, though brought to his knees on to the earth, he was not deprived of his life."
Yuddha Kanda,59,88,"Seeing Nila unconscious, Ravana, eager for fight, in his chariot whose rattling sounded like thunder-clouds, rushed on Lakshmana."
Yuddha Kanda,59,89,"Coming to the centre of the battle-field, the powerful Ravana the King of Demons prevented Lakshmana to go forward, halted, standing there in his glory and lifted up his bow."
Yuddha Kanda,59,90,"Lakshmana of indomitable courage spoke to that Ravana who was lifting up his unfathomable bow (as follows): ""O, King of Demons! Now enter into combat with me; cease from fighting with the monkeys!"""
Yuddha Kanda,59,91,"Hearing that marvellously modulated voice that resounded like the twanging of a bow-string, Ravana drawing near his adversary, who stood close to his chariot, answered in anger:"
Yuddha Kanda,59,92,"""O, Lakshmana! By my good fortune, you in your perverted mind, reached within my range of sight so as to meet your death. This very instant, you will go to the region of Death, after having collapsed by the bang of my rain of arrows."""
Yuddha Kanda,59,93,"Then, Lakshmana, unmoved spoke to that Ravana who was roaring with his sharp and protruding teeth (as follows): ""Greatly dignified ones eschew bragging! O, the foremost of evil-doers! You are sounding your own praises!"""
Yuddha Kanda,59,94,"""O, King of Demons! I know your valour, strength, energy and courage! Come! I now stand here, with my bow and arrows in hand. O what use are vain boasts."""
Yuddha Kanda,59,95,"Thus accosted, the King of Demons, infuriated, loosened seven marvellously plumed arrows which Lakshmana shattered with his beautiful golden-shafted arrows of sharp ends and edges."
Yuddha Kanda,59,96,"Beholding those arrows shattered like great cobras with their hoods shattered, Ravana got angry and loosened other sharp arrows."
Yuddha Kanda,59,97,"Lakshmana, however, caused a well-aimed rain of missiles from his bow to fall on Ravana and nay, even broke Ravana's arrows with his arrows called Khura, Ardhachandra, the excellent Karni and Bhalla. He did not feel perturbed."
Yuddha Kanda,59,98,"Seeing his successive arrows proving in vain, Ravana the King of those hostile to Gods was astonished at Lakshmana's skill and released more whetted shafts upon him."
Yuddha Kanda,59,99,"Lakshmana, the equal of Mahendra the Lord of celestials, fixing some sharpened arrows, swift as lightning and of blazing effulgence on his bow-string, discharged them on Ravana in order to strike him down."
Yuddha Kanda,59,100,"Whereupon, Ravana the King of Demons shattered those pointed arrows and struck Lakshmana in the forehead with a struck Lakshmana in the forehead with a shaft as bright as the Fire of Time, which had been bestowed on him by Brahma the Lord of Creation."
Yuddha Kanda,59,101,"Struck by Ravana's arrow, Lakshmana reeled a little and was scarcely able to retain his bow. But, coming to his consciousness with difficulty, he shattered that weapon belonging to Ravana, Indra's enemy."
Yuddha Kanda,59,102,"Then, Lakshmana the son of Dasaratha struck Ravana, whose bow was broken, with three pointed darts. The king, pierced by those arrows, swooned and regained his senses with difficulty."
Yuddha Kanda,59,103,"Ravana, the enemy of celestials, whose bow was broken, struck by the arrows, his limbs spattered with flesh, and streaming with blood, himself of formidable energy, seized in the battle a spear gifted to him by Brahma the Lord of Creation."
Yuddha Kanda,59,104,"Ravana the Lord of the country of demons hurled with strength on Lakshmana, that blazing spear, emitting smoke and as bright as fire, frightening the monkeys in the fray."
Yuddha Kanda,59,105,"Lakshmana the younger brother of Bharata struck that weapon falling upon him with arrows and darts, as if it were a sacrificial fire. Nevertheless, that spear entered Lakshmana's broad chest."
Yuddha Kanda,59,106,"The mighty Lakshmana, struck by the spear, lay on the earth, breathing fire. The king, rushing suddenly on him who was yet insensible, seized him brutally in his hands."
Yuddha Kanda,59,107,"Though he was able to lift up Himavat, Mandara and Meru mountains as also the Three Worlds with the Gods, he could not raise Lakshmana the younger brother of Bharata."
Yuddha Kanda,59,108,"Lakshmana, though wounded in the breast by Brahma's weapon, recollected that he was an inconceivable fraction of Vishnu Himself."
Yuddha Kanda,59,109,"Ravana that thorn in the side of the Gods, though overcoming that Lakshmana who removed the pride of demons, was unable to bear him away with his hands."
Yuddha Kanda,59,110,"Thereupon, the enraged Hanuma the son of the Wind-God, rushed towards Ravana and struck angrily on his chest with his fist, resembling a thunder-bolt."
Yuddha Kanda,59,111,"By that blow of the fist, Ravana the Lord of Demons reeled and fell on his knees to the ground."
Yuddha Kanda,59,112,"A lot of blood oozed out from his face, eyes, and ears. Reeled and motionless, he became and sat in the middle of the chariot."
Yuddha Kanda,59,113,"Seeing Ravana despite his redoubtable strength swooned on the battle-field, sages and monkeys began to shout in triumph as did also celestials and the demons (invisibly present on the scene)."
Yuddha Kanda,59,114,"Then, the courageous Hanuma lifting up Lakshmana in his arms, who had been wounded by Ravana, brought him to Rama's presence."
Yuddha Kanda,59,115,"That Lakshmana, whom his foes were unable to move, became light for Hanuma because of friendship and great devotion of Hanuma the son of Wind-God towards him."
Yuddha Kanda,59,116,"That spear leaving Lakshmana, who was overcome in the battle, returned to its position in that chariot of Ravana."
Yuddha Kanda,59,117,"The mighty Ravana too, regaining his consciousness in the great battle-field, picked up his sharp arrows and the great bow."
Yuddha Kanda,59,118,"Healed and free from that lance, Lakshmana the annihilator of his foes, recollected of himself as a part of the inconceivable Vishnu the Lord of Preservation."
Yuddha Kanda,59,119,"Beholding the great army of monkeys whose great warriors were overthrown on the battle-field, Rama rushed on Ravana."
Yuddha Kanda,59,120,"Meanwhile, Hanuma approaching Rama spoke the following words: ""You have to punish the demon by climbing my back, as Vishnu on Garuda in order to fight with the Enemy of Gods."""
Yuddha Kanda,59,121,"Hearing those words spoken by Hanuma the son of Wind-God, Rama soon after mounted the great monkey, Hanuma. Rama the Lord of men then saw Ravana standing in his chariot in the battle-field."
Yuddha Kanda,59,122,The mighty Rama became angry on seeing him and rushed upon that Ravana like unto Vishnu with his uplifted mace rushed upon Virochana.
Yuddha Kanda,59,123,"Rama made a sound in drawing the cord of his bow and like unto the roll of thunder, spoke in a deep voice to Ravana as follows:"
Yuddha Kanda,59,124,"""O, Tiger among the Demons! Stay, stay! Having evoked such a displeasure to me, where will you flee and get an abandonment?"""
Yuddha Kanda,59,125,"""Even if you seek refuge in the region of Indra the Lord of celestials or Yama the Lord of Death or the Sun or Brahma the Lord of Creation or Agni the Lord of Fire or Shiva the Lord of dissolution or in the ten regions, even in those abodes you will elude me from now on."""
Yuddha Kanda,59,126,"""O, Ravana the King of Demons! The one who was struck by the spear, fell swooping this day only to recover consciousness immediately, will now, assuming the form of death, claim you, your sons and grandsons in battle."""
Yuddha Kanda,59,127,"""Here is he, under whose blows of arrows, fourteen thousand demons of terrible form perished, who had established themselves in Janasthana and were furnished with excellent weapons."""
Yuddha Kanda,59,128,"Hearing the words of Rama, Ravana of great strength, full of rage and recollecting his former hostility struck with flaming arrows resembling the tongues of the Fire of Dissolution, on Hanuman the son of Wind-God, who with extreme velocity, was bearing Rama in the battle-field."
Yuddha Kanda,59,129,"Even when struck by that demon with his arrows in the battle, the vigour of Hanuman, who was endowed with native strength, increased still further."
Yuddha Kanda,59,130,"Thereupon, seeing Hanuman the Tiger among the monkeys getting wounded by Ravana, Rama was transported with anger."
Yuddha Kanda,59,131,"Going near his chariot with his sharp and pointed arrows, Rama shattered it along with its wheels, horses, banner, canopy, great standard, charioteer, darts, spears and swords."
Yuddha Kanda,59,132,"Thereupon, with a great force, Rama struck with his shaft shining brightly as the thunderbolt, that Ravana, the enemy of Indra, in his broad and beautiful chest, even as the mighty Indra would strike the Mount Meru with his thunderbolt."
Yuddha Kanda,59,133,"That valiant King of Demons, whom neither thunder nor lightning could cause disturbance or trembling; stumbled letting fall his bow at the valiant impact of Rama's missile which created a deep injury."
Yuddha Kanda,59,134,"Seeing that Ravana swooning, the magnanimous Rama took up a blazing arrow shaped like a crescent moon and immediately used it to shatter the diadem of Ravana the Lord of Demons, which was of bright hue."
Yuddha Kanda,59,135,"In that battle-field, Rama said to that Lord of Demons whose splendour was dimmed, the setting of his diadem river, who resembled a venomous snake robbed of its poison or like a sun its rays extinguished, bereft of lustre."
Yuddha Kanda,59,136,"""You have accomplished a highly terrific great feat and my brave soldiers have succumbed beneath your blows. Now, you are weary and in this condition, I shall not put you under the clutches of Death."""
Yuddha Kanda,59,137,"""O, King of the Ranger of night! I know you have been tormented in the battle. Go and return to Lanka. Having regained your breath, come back in your chariot with your bow and then standing in your chariot, you will witness once more my prowess."""
Yuddha Kanda,59,138,"At these words, that King Ravana, his joy boasting subdued, his bow shattered, his horses and chariot slain pierced with arrows, his great diadem broken, he soon returned to Lanka."
Yuddha Kanda,59,139,"While that mighty Ravana the Lord of Demons and the enemy of celestials and titans returned to Lanka, Rama arranged for drawing out arrows from monkeys and from Lakshmana too, in the forefront of that vast battle-field."
Yuddha Kanda,59,140,"That Ravana, the adversary of the King of the Gods being vanquished, the celestials, Asuras the multitude of beings in all the quarters, the creatures of the ocean with the great serpents as also all beings on earth and in waters rejoiced very much."
Yuddha Kanda,60,1,"Returning to the City of Lanka, Ravana the King of Demons was afflicted with the fear of Rama's arrows, his pride was humbled and his senses troubled."
Yuddha Kanda,60,2,"The king was overcome by the high-souled Rama, like an elephant is by a lion or a serpent by an eagle."
Yuddha Kanda,60,3,The Lord of Demons was maddened in recollecting Rama's arrows resembling the Rod of Brahma the Lord of creation and possessed of the splendour of lightning.
Yuddha Kanda,60,4,"Resting on an excellent and charming throne made of gold, Ravana looked at the demons and spoke the following words:"
Yuddha Kanda,60,5,"""All that great penance performed by me became a waste indeed, for, I who am equal to Mahendra the Lord of Celestials have been defeated by a mere man!"""
Yuddha Kanda,60,6,"""The terrible words of Brahma the Lord of Creation saying, 'You know of the threat from men' appear true. That is so."""
Yuddha Kanda,60,7,"""I sought immunity from death at the hands of celestials, titans or celestials musicians, or semi divine beings or demons or serpent-demons, but f man I made no mention."""
Yuddha Kanda,60,8,"""Rama the son of Dasaratha is the man I think of whom Anaranya born of Ikshvaku dynasty formerly spoke, saying: 'O, the worst of demons, the worst of your race and the wretched one! In my race will be born a man who will slay you in battle with your sons, ministers, army, horses and charioteer."""
Yuddha Kanda,60,9,"""Further, I was formerly cursed by Vedavati when she was humiliated by me. The same Vedavati is born as the highly fortunate Seetha the daughter of Janaka."""
Yuddha Kanda,60,10,"""What was predicted by Parvati the consort of Shiva, Nandishvara the attendant of Shiva, Rambha the wife of Nalakubara and Punjikasthala the daughter of Varunda has come to pass! The words of the sages never prove false."""
Yuddha Kanda,60,11,"""On account of all this and admitting it, you should exert yourselves to the uttermost. Let the demons go to the summit of Charya Mountain."""
Yuddha Kanda,60,12,"""Awaken that kumbhakarna, who is without equal in prowess, who humbles the pride of the celestials and demons, and on whom the curse of Brahma the Lord of creation rests."""
Yuddha Kanda,60,13,"Having known that Prahasta being slain and knowing himself to have been defeated in the battle, Ravana issued his commands tot he dreadful army, saying:"
Yuddha Kanda,60,14,"""Guard the gates with utmost care. Man the ramparts. Rouse Kumbhakarna who is slumbering soundly."""
Yuddha Kanda,60,15,"""Kumbhakarna is sleeping happily, his understanding vitiated by lust and free from all anxieties. The demon sleeps for nine, seven, ten or eight months."
Yuddha Kanda,60,16,"""Having deliberated with me nine days ago, he has since fallen asleep. Awaken quickly that mighty Kumbhakarna."""
Yuddha Kanda,60,17,"""The mighty armed Kumbhakarna, the foremost of all demons will kill the monkeys and the two princes at once in the battle."""
Yuddha Kanda,60,18,"""This Kumbhakarna, the chief among all the demons and a great mark in the battle, being fond of a rustic comfort, is always sleeping stupidly."""
Yuddha Kanda,60,19,"""If Kumbhakarna is awaken, there will be no worry for me, who stand defeated by Rama in this highly terrific battle."""
Yuddha Kanda,60,20,"""What is the use of him, who possessing a strength equal to that of Indra the Lord of celestials, cannot help me in such a dreadful catastrophe?"""
Yuddha Kanda,60,21,"Hearing those words of Ravana, those demons very briskly went to the abode of Kumbhakarna."
Yuddha Kanda,60,22,"Entering the beautiful cave of Kumbhakarna, with a large door, having an area of a Yojana on all sides and bearing a floral perfume, the demons of mighty strength, though shaken off by Kumbhakarna's breaths, remained stable forcefully with difficulty and went into the cave."
Yuddha Kanda,60,23,"Entering that beautiful cave inlaid with diamonds and gold, those tigers among demons beheld Kumbhakarna, of terrific prowess, who was sleeping."
Yuddha Kanda,60,24,They together tried to awaken Kumbhakarna who was sleeping nastily like a spread-out mountain in a great slumber.
Yuddha Kanda,60,25,"His limbs covered with down which stood on end, breathing like a serpent, as he slept, Kumbhakarna of irresistible valour emitted dreadful snores, his nostrils being horrible, and his mouth a gaping hell. Stretched to his full length on the earth, he gave forth an odour of marrow and blood, his limbs were adorned with golden armlets and he wore a diadem as bright as the sun, thus did that lion among demons, Kumbhakarna, the slayer of his foes, appear!"
Yuddha Kanda,60,26,"Then, those powerful demons, in order to satisfy him, placed a heap of venison as high as Mount Meru, in front of Kumbhakarna."
Yuddha Kanda,60,27,"Those excellent demons piled up a great mass of wonderful food with the meat of deers, buffaloes and pigs."
Yuddha Kanda,60,28,"Then, the demons placed pots of blood and various kinds of meat in front of Kumbhakarna."
Yuddha Kanda,60,29,They rubbed Kumbhakarna the scourge of his foes with the most rare sandalwood and refreshed him with celestial and fragrant garlands as well as sweet-smelling perfumes.
Yuddha Kanda,60,30,They burnt incenses and hymned the praises of that warrior who proved fatal to his foes. They cried out noises which burst forth on every side like thunder.
Yuddha Kanda,60,31,"They blew couches which were as bright as the moon and with impatience, made with impatience, made sounds tumultuously all at once."
Yuddha Kanda,60,32,"Those demons made sounds by clapping their hands, in order to awaken Kumbhakarna and shook him too, creating a great clamour."
Yuddha Kanda,60,33,"The birds passing through the sky ran helter-shelter and fell down soon on hearing the sounds of the couches, drums, gongs, clapping of hands and leonine roars."
Yuddha Kanda,60,34,"As the illustrious Kumbhakarna did not waken from his slumber despite those great sounds, all troops of demons seized hold of bars, pestles and maces towards him."
Yuddha Kanda,60,35,"Then, the cruel demons struck that sleeping Kumbhakarna on his chest with mountain-tops, pestles, maces, hammers and their fists."
Yuddha Kanda,60,36,"Even with all their strength, the demons could not stand upright before the breathing winds of Kumbhakarna, the demon."
Yuddha Kanda,60,37,"Then, the terribly strong demons firmly seated themselves round him and began to beat drums, cymbals, kettle-drums and myriads of couches and trumpets."
Yuddha Kanda,60,38,"Ten thousand demons surrounded him all at once. Beating that colossus who resembled a heap of antimony, the demons on their part tried to rouse him by making sounds. Even then, he did not wake."
Yuddha Kanda,60,39,"As they were unable to rouse him by these means, they resorted to more energetic and ruthless methods."
Yuddha Kanda,60,40,"They beat horses, camels, donkeys, and elephants with sticks whips and thongs, so that they trample upon him and blasted kettle-drums, couches and drums."
Yuddha Kanda,60,41,"They crushed his limbs under piles of heavy logs and pillars, as also maces lifted with all their strength."
Yuddha Kanda,60,42,"The entire Lanka, with its mountain and groves, was filled with great noise. He nevertheless did not wake."
Yuddha Kanda,60,43,"Then, they beat a thousand drums all around with sticks of refined gold."
Yuddha Kanda,60,44,"Yet, as he did not wake from his profound slumber, being under the spell of a curse, the demons were enraged."
Yuddha Kanda,60,45,All those demons of terrible strength were filled with a great fury. Some others assembled their strength to awaken that demon.
Yuddha Kanda,60,46,"Some beat drums, some shouted, some tore out his hair and some others bit his ears."
Yuddha Kanda,60,47,"Some poured hundreds of pitchers of water into his ears but Kumbhakarna, plunged in deep sleep, did not stir."
Yuddha Kanda,60,48,"Some strong ones, armed with rocks and hammers, struck the rocks and hammers on his head, chest and other limbs."
Yuddha Kanda,60,49,"Though smitten by missiles fastened with ropes on all sides, the giant bodied demon did not wake."
Yuddha Kanda,60,50,A thousand elephants ran up and down on his body till Kumbhakarna lightly woke up and became aware of the pressure.
Yuddha Kanda,60,51,"Being insensible to those violent blows of crags and trees hurled upon him, but under the prompting of extreme hunger, Kumbhakarna suddenly sprang up from sleep, yawning due to loss of sleep."
Yuddha Kanda,60,52,"Waving his arms resembling serpent's coils or the peaks of mountains, hard as cut diamonds, that demons opening his monstrous month like unto the face of a submarine fire, yawned."
Yuddha Kanda,60,53,His mouth yawning horribly resembled hell and appeared like the sun rising under the high peak of Meru Mountain.
Yuddha Kanda,60,54,"That mighty demon, being awake, yawned, heaving a sigh, like unto a tempest arising from a mountain."
Yuddha Kanda,60,55,"That figure of Kumbhakarna, rising up, stood out resembling Time at the dissolution of the world, prepared to devour all beings."
Yuddha Kanda,60,56,"His huge eyes, resembling flames of fire, with a glitter equal to that of lightning, appeared like great blazing planets."
Yuddha Kanda,60,57,"Then, the demons pointed to various kinds of victuals, boar and buffalo. The mighty Kumbhakarna devoured them."
Yuddha Kanda,60,58,"Then, the hungry Kumbhakarna, the enemy of Indra, ate the meat and being thirsty drank the blood and gulped pitchers full of fat and wine."
Yuddha Kanda,60,59,"Thereupon, knowing that Kumbhakarna was gratified of his hunger, the demons approached him, saluting him with their heads bent and surrounded him on all sides."
Yuddha Kanda,60,60,"Raising his eyelids that were heavy with sleep, his gaze still veiled, he directed his glance towards those demons and spoke as follows:"
Yuddha Kanda,60,61,"That excellent demons kindly addressing all the demons and surprised at being roused, spoke the following words to the demons:"
Yuddha Kanda,60,62,"""For what reason have you thus wakened me so suddenly? Is all well with the king or anything in peril here?"""
Yuddha Kanda,60,63,"""Surely, there must be some great danger from an external source since you have wakened me in haste."""
Yuddha Kanda,60,64,"""Now, I shall drive away the misfortune from Ravana the King of Demons, even if I have to cut Mahendra himself to pieces or to freeze the Fire."
Yuddha Kanda,60,65,"""For a petty reason, one does not indeed awaken, one such as I, from my slumber. Hence, tell me frankly, for what reason you have roused me."""
Yuddha Kanda,60,66,"Yupaksha, a minister of the King, with his hands joined salutation, spoke (as follows) to Kumbhakarna, the annihilator of his enemies, thus talking excitedly."

Yuddha Kanda,60,68,"""O, Prince! It is not indeed the celestials or demons who have put us in such a peril as it comes to us from a man."""
Yuddha Kanda,60,69,"""Monkeys, whose forms are as large as mountains, are besieging Lanka. There is a tumultuous peril for us from Rama, who is furious on account of Seetha's abduction."""

Yuddha Kanda,60,79,"The demons, having awaken that sleeping Kumbhakarna of dreadful eyes, form and valour, went to the King's palace in haste."
Yuddha Kanda,60,80,"All those demons, approaching Ravana who was seated on the throne, said to him with joined palms, as follows:"

Yuddha Kanda,60,82,"Ravana answered those demons who stood before him and with a glad heart, said: ""I want to see him here. Bring him after extending the honours due to him in a befitting manner."""
Yuddha Kanda,60,83,"Uttering ""Be it so"", all those demons as commanded by Ravana, returned to Kumbhakarna and spoke the following words:"

Yuddha Kanda,60,85,"Hearing his brother's wish, Kumbhakarna the inviolable demon of great prowess, uttering ""so be it"", leapt up from his couch."
Yuddha Kanda,60,86,"Washing his face and bathing, refreshed and delighted, adorning himself well and feeling thirsty, he hastened them to bring him a drink which can boost up his strength."
Yuddha Kanda,60,87,"Thereupon, those demons brought him quickly the wine and various kinds of eatable there, in their hurry to take Kumbhakarna with them as per Ravana's commands."
Yuddha Kanda,60,88,"Having drunk two thousand pitchers, Kumbhakarna prepared to set out and slightly inebriated and flushed, he was exhilarated and filled with energy."
Yuddha Kanda,60,89,"The fuming Kumbhakarna, going to his brother's palace along with the army of demons, appeared like Yama the Lord of Death at the end of all-destroying Time. He caused the earth to tremble with his foot-steps, while marching."
Yuddha Kanda,60,90,"The royal high way was illumined by his body, like unto that orb of a thousand rays (the sun) by its flashes illumines the earth and he went there, surrounded by a circle of demons paying obeisance, resembling Indra the Lord of Celestials approaching the abode of Brahma the Lord of Creation."
Yuddha Kanda,60,91,"Seeing that slayer of his foes on the royal high way, that monster as high as the peak of a mountain, those monkeys stationed outside the city, as also their leaders, were frightened suddenly."
Yuddha Kanda,60,92,"Some gained refuge in Rama who affords protection, some fell down tottering, some fled away perturbed in all directions and some others lay on the ground, confounded with fear."
Yuddha Kanda,60,93,"Seeing that colossus appearing like a great peak, having a diadem who seemed to touch the sun with his brilliance, the monkeys were seized with terror and had grown immensely in size, fled hither and thither."

Yuddha Kanda,65,37,"The demons followed, with their red hot eyes, large colossal bodies resembling a mass of collyrium in hue, lifting up spikes, swords, sharp axes, javelins, iron rods, maces, mallets, enormous trunks of palmyrah trees to be hurled at and difficult to be met."
Yuddha Kanda,65,38,"Then, that Kumbhakarna, of a great splendour and a great strength, assuming another body of a formidable and terrific form, with a breadth of a hundred bows and six hundred bows in height, with his eyes resembling the wheels of a cart, looking like a huge mountain and terrible to look at, sallied forth."
Yuddha Kanda,65,39,"Kumbhakarna with his colossal body and a huge mouth, looking like a scorched hill, approaching the demons and laughing loudly, spoke as follows:"

Yuddha Kanda,65,44,"As that intelligent Kumbhakarna was sallying forth quickly for the battle, omens of terrific patterns appeared on all sides."
Yuddha Kanda,65,45,"Clouds, ashy in colour like asses, combined with meteors and strokes of lightning appeared. Even the earth trembled, together with its oceans and forests."
Yuddha Kanda,65,46,Jackals of terrific form howled with flaming morsels in their mouths and birds twirled in circles from right to left.
Yuddha Kanda,65,47,"A vulture descended on the spike of Kumbhakarna, as he was sallying forth along the road. His left eye twitched and his left arm throbbed."
Yuddha Kanda,65,48,"Then, a blazing meteor fell down with a dreadful noise. Even the sun became lusterless and the wind was not blowing comfortably."
Yuddha Kanda,65,49,"Disregarding those great portents indicated, causing the hair to stand erect, Kumbhakarna on his part marched on, driven by the power of fate."
Yuddha Kanda,65,50,"Kumbhakarna, looking like a mountain, traversing the rampart with his feet alone, saw a wonderful army of monkeys, looking similar to a thick coverage of clouds."
Yuddha Kanda,65,51,"Seeing that Kumbhakarna, the excellent among demons, looking equal to a mountain, the monkeys then ran away to all directions, as clouds are driven away by the wind."
Yuddha Kanda,65,52,"Looking towards that highly fierce army of monkeys, running away to different quarters, as a net-work of broken clouds, that Kumbhakarna with the hue of a black cloud, highly rejoiced, repeatedly emitted a roar-like thunder."
Yuddha Kanda,65,53,"Hearing his terrific roar, similar to the rumbling of a cloud in the sky, many of those monkeys fell down on the ground, like Sal trees cut-up by the roots."
Yuddha Kanda,65,54,"Wielding a large iron rod for the destroyable of the enemies, that gigantic Kumbhakarna looked like Yama the lord of death armed with a rod of punishment, waiting upon him as his attendant at the time of dissolution of the world and caused a great terrific fear to the troops of monkeys."
Yuddha Kanda,66,1,"That mighty Kumbhakarna, with his colossal body resembling the peak of a mountain, having crossed the rampart, sallied forth from the city."
Yuddha Kanda,66,2,"Kumbhakarna emitted a roar, making the sea to reverberate, causing the mountains to quake and drowning the thunder-claps, as it were."
Yuddha Kanda,66,3,"Seeing that demons of terrific eyes who could not be destroyed either by Indra the lord of celestials or by Yama the lord of death or by Varuna the god of water, the monkeys ran away."
Yuddha Kanda,66,4,"Seeing them running away, Angada the prince spoke to Nala, Neela, Gavaksha and the mighty Kumuda as follows:"
Yuddha Kanda,66,5,"""Where do you go, forgetting your own dignities as also nobilities of birth and trembling with fear like common monkeys?"""
Yuddha Kanda,66,6,"""O auspicious monkeys! Please return! Why do you so fully guard your lives? This demon is not competent for a combat. He is merely a great toy of terror."""
Yuddha Kanda,66,7,"""O monkeys! By our prowess, we shall destroy this giant toy produced by demons. Come back!"""
Yuddha Kanda,66,8,"Reconciling themselves with some difficulty, the monkeys, from all sides, assembled together at a place and snatching some trees, the monkeys for their part, towards the battle-field."
Yuddha Kanda,66,9,"Like elephants in rut, those monkeys, having came back, hurriedly hit Kumbhakarna, very much enraged as they were."
Yuddha Kanda,66,10,"The mighty Kumbhakarna, though assaulted with lofty mountain-tops, rocks and trees with blossoms at their ends, stood unshaken."
Yuddha Kanda,66,11,"Many rocks, fallen on his limbs, got burst into pieces. The trees, with blossoms at their ends, were broken and fell shattered on the floor."
Yuddha Kanda,66,12,"Kumbhakarna too, very much enraged, crushed the ranks of monkeys though they were greatly energetic, with his extreme exertion even as a rising fire would consume the woods."
Yuddha Kanda,66,13,"Many of the foremost among the monkeys lay on the ground, bathed in blood as they were, fallen like trees with crimson flowers, when tossed up by the demon."
Yuddha Kanda,66,14,"Some monkeys, while jumping and running away, did not look back. Some fell in the ocean. Some inhabited the sky."
Yuddha Kanda,66,15,"While that demon was killing some warriors of monkeys playfully, some others ran away by the same route, by which they earlier crossed the ocean."
Yuddha Kanda,66,16,"While some monkeys becoming pale-faced due to fear, inhabited the mounds and the low grounds, some bears ascended the trees. Some escaped to a hill."
Yuddha Kanda,66,17,"Some were drowned in the ocean. Some had recourse into the caves. Some others escaped. Some could not even stand stable on the ground. Some fell down. Some lied down, as though they were dead."
Yuddha Kanda,66,18,"Seeing those monkeys disorderly retreated, Angada spoke these words, ""Stay. We shall carry on the battle. Come back."""
Yuddha Kanda,66,19,"""I do not catch sight of any place for you, who have retreated, even if you roam over the entire earth. Let all of you come back. Why do you safeguard your lives?"""
Yuddha Kanda,66,20,"""O valiant monkeys, moving without hindrances! Your wives, seeing you running away leaving your weapos aside, will mock at you. It is indeed a death for those who lived well."""
Yuddha Kanda,66,21,"""All of us are born in distinguished races; which are well developed. Where to you go frightened, like ordinary monkeys? As you are running away with fear, leaving all your valour, you are indeed unworthy of honour."""
Yuddha Kanda,66,22,"""Where did those boasting words of you melt away, in which you highly projected yourself in front of the people just before coming for the battle?"
Yuddha Kanda,66,23,"""The cowards, who survive even after being reproached, have to hear slanders from the people. Let the path trodden by the good people be followed. Let your fear be abandoned."""
Yuddha Kanda,66,24,"""If our longevity is short, we shall lie down, being killed by the enemies, on the earth and reach the realm of Brahma (residence of pious spirits), which is difficult to be attained by bad warriors."""
Yuddha Kanda,66,25,"""O monkeys! We shall obtain glory by killing our enemies in battle or if killed on the other hand, we shall enjoy the heaven, attained by the warriors."""
Yuddha Kanda,66,26,"""Coming face to face with Rama, Kumbhakarna will not go back alive, any more than a moth meeting a blazing fire."""
Yuddha Kanda,66,27,"""If we, in large numbers, who are intended to fight, are conquered by one person alone and if we protect our lives by running away, our glory will undergo a damage."""
Yuddha Kanda,66,28,"Then, those fleeing monkeys spoke the following words, which were contemptible by the warriors, to that valiant Angada, who was adorneed with golden armlets."
Yuddha Kanda,66,29,"""For us, it is enough of this terrific battle with Kumbhakarna, the demon. It is not the proper time to stay back but it is to time to go away. Life is indeed dear to us."""
Yuddha Kanda,66,30,"Seeing that terrific Kumbhakarna coming with his dreadful eyes, all those commanders of monkey-troops, speaking words only thus far, scattered in all directions."
Yuddha Kanda,66,31,"Thereafter, with the coaxing words and inferential arguments by Angada, all those fleeing commanders of monkeys turned back."
Yuddha Kanda,66,32,"Having been cheered up by the intellectual Angada, all those commanders of the army-troops stood awaiting his command."
Yuddha Kanda,66,33,"Rishabha, Sharabha, Mainda, Dhumra, Neela, Kumuda, sushena, Gavaksha, Rambha, Tara and more particularly Dvipada, Panasa and hanuma marched ahead very quickly, with their faces turned towards the battle."
Yuddha Kanda,67,1,"Hearing the words of Angada, all those large-bodied monkeys who came back, having arrived at a firm resolution, were waiting for the battle."
Yuddha Kanda,67,2,"Restored to confidence by the words of the mighty Angada, those monkeys, whose energy was well-augmented and prowess well-elevated, restored to a thrill of rapture and as they were determined to die, marched forward to fight. Ready to abandon their lives, they were engaged in a tumultuous battle."
Yuddha Kanda,67,3,"Lifting up trees and very large mountain-rocks, the large-bodied monkeys thereupon briskly ran towards Kumbhakarna."
Yuddha Kanda,67,4,"The mighty and valiant Kumbhakarna, who got very much enraged, lifting a mace and frightening his enemies, diffused them on all sides."
Yuddha Kanda,67,5,"Seven hundred, eight hundred and thousands of monkeys struck by Kumbhakarna, lay scattered on the ground."
Yuddha Kanda,67,6,"That highly enraged Kumbhakarna, putting in his mount, (as many as) sixteen or eight or ten or even twenty or thirty monkeys by his hands and devouring them like. Garuda the mythical bird devouring the serpents in lots, ran about the battle-field."
Yuddha Kanda,67,7,"Restored to confidence with difficulty, the monkeys assembling together from all sides, stood in the battle-front, with trees and rocks in their hands."
Yuddha Kanda,67,8,"Pulling out a mountain and looking like a hanging cloud, Dvivida the foremost among the monkeys, ran towards Kumbhakarna, who resembled a mountain-peak."
Yuddha Kanda,67,9,"Dvivida, springing up, hurled that mountain towards Kumbhakarna. Even without reaching the colossal bodied Kumbhakarna, it however fell on his army."
Yuddha Kanda,67,10,"That excellent mountain crushed the horses, elephants and the chariots. Another mountain-top, when hurled, crushed the other demons."
Yuddha Kanda,67,11,"Struck by the jerk of the mountain, that great battle-field of demons, with its horses and charioteers killed, became dampened with blood."
Yuddha Kanda,67,12,"The demons who fight from the chariots, with their terrific roar, at once discarded the heads of the clamouring chiefs of monkeys, with their arrows, which were resembling the god of death at the time of universal dissolution."
Yuddha Kanda,67,13,"Uprooting large trees, the mighty monkeys too began to destroy the chariots, horses, Camels and demons."
Yuddha Kanda,67,14,"Staying in the sky, Hanuma showered mountain-tops, rocks and various types of trees on Kumbhakarna's head."
Yuddha Kanda,67,15,The mighty Kumbhakarna broken those mountain-tops and shattered the torrent of trees with his spike.
Yuddha Kanda,67,16,"Then, taking the dreadful spike in his hand, Kumbhakarna ran towards that terrific army of monkeys. Taking a mountain-peak in his hands, Hanuma stood in front of the approaching Kumbhakarna."
Yuddha Kanda,67,17,"The enraged Hanuma struck with violence Kumbhakarna, who was endowed with a magnificent body and looking like the most elevated mountain. Thus attacked by Hanuma, Kumbhakarna was stumbled with a sprinkling of blood and with his limbs succulent with flesh."
Yuddha Kanda,67,18,"Holding firmly the spike, which was bright as lightning and looking like a blazing mountain-peak, Kumbhakarna struck Hanuma on his chest, as Guha (the son of Shiva) struck Krauncha mountain with his powerful javelin."
Yuddha Kanda,67,19,"That Hanuma, struck in his broad chest by the spike in that great combat, was highly perturbed and while vomiting blood from his mouth, awfully roared like the sound of thunderous clouds at the time of dissolution of the world."
Yuddha Kanda,67,20,"Looking at the perturbed Hanuma, all the troops of demons then suddenly shouted with rejoice. The monkeys, on their part, felt restless and being oppressed with fear, ran away from the battle-field."
Yuddha Kanda,67,21,"Thereupon, cheering up the army and stopping them, the mighty Neela then hurled a mountain-top on the intellectual Kumbhakarna."
Yuddha Kanda,67,22,"Seeing that mountain-top befalling on him, Kumbhakarna then struck it with his fist. By that strike of the fist, that mountain-top was burst into pieces and fallen down on the ground, with sparks of fire and blaze."
Yuddha Kanda,67,23,"The five excellent monkeys, viz. Rishabha, Sharabha, Neela, Gavaksha and Gandhamadana marched ahead quickly towards Kumbhakarna."
Yuddha Kanda,67,24,"Those five mighty monkeys struck the large-bodied Kumbhakarna from all sides, with crags, trees, palms of their hands, feet and fists in battle."
Yuddha Kanda,67,25,"Perceiving those blows merely as the senses of touch, Kumbhakarna was not at all perturbed. He enfolded the greatly agitated Rishabha in his arms."
Yuddha Kanda,67,26,"Squeezed by Kumbhakarna's arms, the awful Rishabha, the foremost among the monkeys, fell down with blood coming out of his mouth."
Yuddha Kanda,67,27,"Then, in battle, the enraged Kumbhakarna, the enemy of Indra, beating Sharabha with his fist and Neela with his knee, struck Gavaksha with a palm of his hand and struck Gandhamadana violently with his feet."
Yuddha Kanda,67,28,"Perturbed by the blows given by Kumbhakarna, those monkeys being moistened with blood, were bewildered and fell down on the ground, like chopped off Kimsuka trees."
Yuddha Kanda,67,29,"Seeing those mighty chief commanders of monkeys falling down on the ground, thousands of monkeys ran towards Kumbhakarna."
Yuddha Kanda,67,30,"All those champions of monkeys, looking like mountains, jumping up on Kumbhakarna who was looking like a mountain, ascended him and bit him with their teeth."
Yuddha Kanda,67,31,"Those mighty armed excellent monkeys encountered that Kumbhakarna with their nails, teeth, fists and arms."
Yuddha Kanda,67,32,"Covered by thousands of monkeys that foremost among demons looking like a mountain, stood out in a crowd, as a hill overgrown with trees."
Yuddha Kanda,67,33,"Seizing all the monkeys with his arms, that mighty Kumbhakarna devoured them like an enraged Garuda the eagle devouring the serpents."
Yuddha Kanda,67,34,"Hurled by Kumbhakarna in his mouth which was looking like a hole in the earth, the monkeys again came out from his nostrils and ears."
Yuddha Kanda,67,35,"Kumbhakarna, the best among the demons, looking like a mountain, was very much enraged and mutilated the monkeys angrily, before devouring them."
Yuddha Kanda,67,36,"Making the earth dampened with flesh and blood, that demon, like an excited fire at the time of dissolution, strolled among that army of monkeys."
Yuddha Kanda,67,37,"Wielding a spike in his hand in the battle-front, the mighty Kumbhakarna shone like Indra the lord of celestials wielding a thunderbolt in his hand and like Yama the god of death wielding a noose in his hand."
Yuddha Kanda,67,38,That Kumbhakarna scorched away that army of monkeys in the same way as the fire scorches away the dried-up forests in summer.
Yuddha Kanda,67,39,"Those monkeys, without a commander, having their troops killed and terrified with fear they were being destroyed by Kumbhakarna, roared with rebellious voices."
Yuddha Kanda,67,40,"While Kumbhakarna was destroying them in many ways, the agitated monkeys sought refuge in Rama, with their distressed minds."
Yuddha Kanda,67,41,"Seeing the monkeys defeated in that great battle, Angada the son of Indra, ran rapidly towards Kumbhakarna."
Yuddha Kanda,67,42,"Taking a large mountain-top, Angada, roaring repeatedly and frightening all the demons following Kumbhakarna's heels, hurled the mountain-top on Kumbhakarna's head."
Yuddha Kanda,67,43,"Struck on the head with that mountain, that Kumbhakarna, Indra's adversary, with a great rage, was excited and then ran rapidly towards the wrathful Angada."
Yuddha Kanda,67,44,"Frightening all the monkeys with his great roar, the mighty Kumbhakarna hurled his spike at Angada with anger."
Yuddha Kanda,67,45,"Knowing that the spike is going to fall on him, the mighty Angada, the chief of the monkeys, who was skilled in war-fare, avoided it with his alacrity."
Yuddha Kanda,67,46,"Jumping up Angada struck on Kumbhakarna's chest, with the palm of his hand. Thus beaten with anger by him, Kumbhakarna resembling a mountain, became giddy."
Yuddha Kanda,67,47,"Getting his consciousness, that mighty demon threw down Angada by tightening his fist with a scorn. Angada fell down unconscious."
Yuddha Kanda,67,48,"When that Angada the foremost among the monkeys fell down unconscious on the ground, Kumbhakarna ran towards Sugreeva, taking that spike in his hand."
Yuddha Kanda,67,49,"Then, seeing the mighty Kumbhakarna coming suddenly towards him, the valiant Sugreeva, the king of the monkeys, sprang up all at once."
Yuddha Kanda,67,50,"Uplifting and tightly holding a mountain-top, the mighty Sugreeva ran towards the sturdy Kumbhakarna with speed."
Yuddha Kanda,67,51,"Seeing that Sugreeva coming rapidly towards him, Kumbhakarna, with all his limbs braced, stood facing the king of monkeys."
Yuddha Kanda,67,52,"Seeing Kumbhakarna who stood devouring the monkeys and with his body smeared with the blood of the monkeys, Sugreeva spoke as follows:"
Yuddha Kanda,67,53,"""You struck down eminent monkeys. You have done a very difficult act. You have devoured the armies. You obtained a great fame."""
Yuddha Kanda,67,54,"""Leave that army of monkeys. What will you do with these common beings? O demon! You bear up against the falling of this one mountain being hurled by me."""
Yuddha Kanda,67,55,"Hearing those words, endowed with strength and courage, spoken by Sugreeva, Kumbhakarna, the foremost of demons, spoke the following words:"
Yuddha Kanda,67,56,"""O monkey! You are the grandson of Lord Brahma and even the son of Riksharaja (sprung from the yawn of Brahma) endowed with firmness and valour. Why do you roar?"""
Yuddha Kanda,67,57,"Hearing the words of Kumbhakarna, Sugreeva, firmly holding the mountain, hurled it quickly on him. He struck Kumbhakarna's chest by that mountain, which was as strong enough as Indra's thunderbolt."
Yuddha Kanda,67,58,"Soon after falling on his broad chest, that mountain was crushed to pieces. Then, the monkeys were suddenly distressed. The troops of demons roared with rejoice."
Yuddha Kanda,67,59,"Struck by the mountain-top, that Kumbhakarna was enraged and roared with his mouth wide open with anger. Holding firmly the spike, which was emitting a flash of lightning, he hurled it to kill Sugreeva, the king of monkeys and bears."
Yuddha Kanda,67,60,"Hanuma, jumping up and holding with his arms that sharp spike, furnished with golden wreaths, and propelled by Kumbhakarna's arms, wreaths, and smashed it rapidly."
Yuddha Kanda,67,61,"Then, the rejoiced Hanuma, placing on his knee, that large spike made of iron weighing twenty thousand Tulas, broke it."
Yuddha Kanda,67,62,"Seeing Hanuma breaking the spike, that army of monkeys was rejoiced, roared several times and came back quickly from all quarters."
Yuddha Kanda,67,63,"Then, the frightened Kumbhakarna became down-cast. Those monkeys were rejoiced and made a lion's roar. Seeing the fate of spike in such a broken condition, they adored Hanuma."
Yuddha Kanda,67,64,"Seeing that spike broken in that way, that mighty Kumbhakarna was enraged. Uprooting a crest from Malaya mountain standing in the vicinity of Lanka and approaching Sugreeva, he struck him with it."
Yuddha Kanda,67,65,"Struck by the mountain-top in battle, that Sugreeva fell unconscious on the ground. Seeing him falling unconscious on the ground in battle, the demons wee exceedingly pleased and cried out loudly."
Yuddha Kanda,67,66,"Seizing hold of that Sugreeva having wonderful and terrific prowess in battle, that Kumbhakarna took him away, as an impetuous wind takes away a cloud."
Yuddha Kanda,67,67,"Lifting up Sugreeva appearing like a huge cloud in the battle-field and marching forward, Kumbhakarna shone like Mount Meru, distinguished by its very high and formidable peak."
Yuddha Kanda,67,68,"Then, being praised in the battle-field by the demons for having seized hold of Sugreeva and hearing the sounds of the celestials who were wondering at the seizure of Sugreeva, Kumbhakarna the valiant chief of demons, sallied forth."
Yuddha Kanda,67,69,"While taking away that Sugreeva looking like Indra, Kumbhakarna the adversary of Indra and having the prowess of Indra, thought, ""If he is killed, all this army including Rama gets destroyed."""
Yuddha Kanda,67,70,"Seeing the army of monkeys running away hither and thither and Sgureeva the monkey even being taken away by Kumbhakarna, the intellectual Hanuma, the son of wind-god thought as follows:"
Yuddha Kanda,67,71,"""While Sugreeva is being taken away in this way, what is to be done by me? I shall certainly do that which is justifiable to be done by me. Growing to the size of a mountain, I shall destroy this Kumbhakarna."""
Yuddha Kanda,67,72,"""Let all the monkeys be delighted while Sugreeva the king of monkeys is liberated and the mighty Kumbhakarna, with his body crumbled by the blows of my fists, killed by me in battle."""
Yuddha Kanda,67,73,"""Even otherwise, this Sugreeva can win the freedom himself despite he is taken away by celestials including demons and serpent-demons."""
Yuddha Kanda,67,74,"""I think Sugreeva is not yet conscious of his self, as Kumbhakarna struck him with the blow of a mountain in the battle."""
Yuddha Kanda,67,75,"""Regaining his consciousness within a moment in this great battle, this Sugreeva will do what is good for himself and for his monkeys."""
Yuddha Kanda,67,76,"""If I liberate this great-souled Sugreeva, there will be a painful dislike for him and a perpetual in fame."""
Yuddha Kanda,67,77,"'Therefore, I shall wait for a while, for the king to show his prowess. Meanwhile, I shall cheer up the scattered army of monkeys."""
Yuddha Kanda,67,78,"Thinking in this way, Hanuma the son of wind-god, then again brought firmness to the large army of monkeys."
Yuddha Kanda,67,79,"Taking that Sugreeva who was throbbing, that kumbhakarna entered the City of Lanka, where he was greatly revered with showers of foremost flowers by the citizens staying in celestial cars, streets, houses and gate-ways of temples."
Yuddha Kanda,67,80,"Sprinkled by those showers of pop-corn and fragrant waters and due to the coolness of the royal roads, the mighty Sugreeva gradually regained his consciousness."
Yuddha Kanda,67,81,"The great souled Sugreeva, who was interposed between Kumbhakarna's shoulders, regaining his consciousness with great difficulty and observing the royal highway of the city, repeatedly thought (as follows):"
Yuddha Kanda,67,82,"""Having been captivated in this way, what should I do now? I have to do a proper act now which is desirable and beneficial to the monkeys."""
Yuddha Kanda,67,83,"Thus thinking, Sugreeva tore asunder Kumbhakarna's ears by his nails as also nose by his teeth and ribs by his feet."
Yuddha Kanda,67,84,"Torn asunder with teeth and nails by Sugreeva, that Kumbhakarna with his ears and nose deprived and his limbs moistened with blood, was subdued with rage, threw Sugreeva down on the floor and crushed him."
Yuddha Kanda,67,85,"Crushed down on the floor by that terrific Kumbhakarna and struck by the demons, Sugreeva moved with speed like a ball towards the sky and got united with Rama."
Yuddha Kanda,67,86,"Bereft of his ears and nose, the mighty Kumbhakarna, pouring out blood, shone like a mountain with its streaming cascades."
Yuddha Kanda,67,87,"Kumbhakarna the demon and the brother of Ravana, having his large body bathed in blood, frightful in appearance, vomiting blood with rage, and looking like a mound of black antimony shone akin to a cloud with an evening-twilight. With his face directed towards the battle-front, Kumbhakarna the terrific demon made up his mind to continue his combat."
Yuddha Kanda,67,88,"After the departure of Sugreeva, Kumbhakarna the adversary of Indra, with a rage, marched ahead quickly for the battle. Finding out that he is then without any weapon, the dreadful Kumbhakarna got possession of a hammer-like weapon."
Yuddha Kanda,67,89,"Starting from the city quickly, that mighty Kumbhakarna then devoured that huge army of monkeys in battle, like the devour of people by the augmented fire at the time of dissolution of the world."
Yuddha Kanda,67,90,"Penetrating that huge army of monkeys, Kumbhakarna who was greedily desirous of flesh and blood in hunger, due to his deep bewilderment in battle, ate away even the demons, monkeys, devils and bears. He devoured the principal monkeys just as the death devours people at the time of the end of the world."
Yuddha Kanda,67,91,"The enraged Kumbhakarna, quickly taking with his single hand, the monkeys and demons, in one's two's, three's or in many and hurled them into his mouth"
Yuddha Kanda,67,92,"Struck with mountain-peaks, by the monkeys, the mighty Kumbhakarna, then, gushing forth his flesh and blood, devoured the monkeys."
Yuddha Kanda,67,93,"Thereupon, those monkeys, who were being devoured, sought Rama as their refuge. The very much enraged Kumbhakarna, while eating away the monkeys, marched forward."
Yuddha Kanda,67,94,"Grasping a hundred, a seven, an eight, a twenty and a thirty with his arms, Kumbhakarna was devouring the monkeys and running about in the battle-field."
Yuddha Kanda,67,95,"Having his entire body besmeared with flesh, marrow and blood together with wreaths of tangled viscera hung over his ears, the demon with his very sharp teeth, rained spikes on the monkeys, like Yama, the god of death, risen to power at the end of the world-cycle."
Yuddha Kanda,67,96,"Immediately, Lakshmana the son of Sumitra, the annihilator of the foe's army and conqueror of the cities of adversaries, commenced the battle with a rage."
Yuddha Kanda,67,97,The valiant Lakshmana pierced seven arrows into the body of Kumbhakarna. He took some more arrows and released them too.
Yuddha Kanda,67,98,"Tormented by that weapon of Lakshmana, that demon destroyed it completely. Thereupon, the aggressive Lakshmana was enraged."
Yuddha Kanda,67,99,"Then, Lakshmana covered the shining and charming golden armour of Kumbhakarna with his arrows, even as the wind would make an evening-twilight cloud completely disappear."
Yuddha Kanda,67,100,"Kumbhakarna, looking like a mound of collyrium, tormented by the arrows, decked with gold, shone like the radiant sun with its rays screened by clouds."
Yuddha Kanda,67,101,"Then, that terrific demon, with a thunderous noise of multiple clouds, spoke the following words disrespectfully to Lakshmana."
Yuddha Kanda,67,102,"""You declared your heroism fearlessly in battle, by attacking me, who has conquered even the lord of death effortlessly in a combat."""
Yuddha Kanda,67,103,"""Anyone who even stands before me, the god of death, holding forth a weapon in a great battle here, is venerable. What to tell about a person who bestows battle on me?"""
Yuddha Kanda,67,104,"""Even the powerful Indra, the lord of celestials, who mounted Airavata the elephant and accompanied by all celestials, did not ever stand before me in battle."""
Yuddha Kanda,67,105,"""O Lakshmana! Today, I am gratified by your strength and abilities. Taking leave of you, I desire to march forward towards Rama."""
Yuddha Kanda,67,106,"""Because I have been gratified by you by way of your ability, strength and firmness in battle, I for my part desire to kill Rama alone, for when he is killed, all the army will be killed."""
Yuddha Kanda,67,107,"""When Rama is killed by me battle here, I will make my army to fight with others who remain on the battle filled and destroy them."""
Yuddha Kanda,67,108,"To that demon in battle, who has given his opinion thus, abounding in enology, Lakshmana as though bursting with laughter, spoke the following extremely terrific words:"
Yuddha Kanda,67,109,"""O brave demon! You are telling that while you show your prowess, the heroes like Indra and others feel unbearable; it is true. Just now, I have seen your prowess. But, see Rama the son of Dasaratha, standing here unmoving like a mountain."""
Yuddha Kanda,67,110,"Hearing in this manner, that mighty Kumbhakarna the demon, brushing aside Lakshmana and crossing him, ran, as though he is causing an earth-quake, towards Rama."
Yuddha Kanda,67,111,"Thereupon, Rama, the son of Dasaratha, employing a spell (used to charm arrows) called Raudra, discharged sharp arrows into Kumbhakarna's chest."
Yuddha Kanda,67,112,"Flames of fire mixed with particles of charcoal came forth from the face of Kumbhakarna, who was thus struck and who was running quickly towards Rama."
Yuddha Kanda,67,113,"That foremost among demons, struck by Rama's arrow, roaring terribly with rage, making the monkeys to run away in battle, ran himself towards Rama."
Yuddha Kanda,67,114,"Those arrows, adorned with peacock's plumes, penetrated into his chest. His mace dropped off from his hand and fell on the ground."
Yuddha Kanda,67,115,"All his weapons fell scattered on the ground. Considering himself as weaponless, that mighty Kumbhakarna then fought fiercely with his fists and arms."
Yuddha Kanda,67,116,"That Kumbhakarna, with his body struck fiercely by arrows and bathed in blood, poured forth blood, even as a mountain would pour forth a cascade."
Yuddha Kanda,67,117,"With a terrific wrath, he felt insensible with blood. He roamed about, devouring the monkeys, demons and bears."
Yuddha Kanda,67,118,"Then, that Kumbhakarna, comparable to Yama the god of death, of terrific prowess and strength, firmly holding a fearful mountain-peak, hurled it towards Rama."
Yuddha Kanda,67,119,"Wile that mountain peak was still on its way and had not yet reached him Rama, fixing together his well-known bow and arrows, split the mountain in the middle, with seven straight-going arrows."
Yuddha Kanda,67,120,"Then, Rama, the virtuous man and the elder brother of Bharata, split the large mountain-peak which was hurled by Kumbhakarna at that time, with his variegated arrows made of gold."
Yuddha Kanda,67,121,"That mountain-peak, in the form of a peak of Mount Meru, as if shining with splendour, while falling, caused two hundred monkeys to fall."
Yuddha Kanda,67,122,"At that time, considering various strategies appropriate for killing Kumbhakarna, the righteous Lakshmana spoke to Rama as follows:"
Yuddha Kanda,67,123,"""O king! He is not able to recognize who the monkeys are and who the demons are. Intoxicated with the smell of blood, he is devouring his own persons and also others."""
Yuddha Kanda,67,124,"""Let the foremost of monkeys ascend well upon his body from all sides. Following the commanders of their troops, let the monkey-leaders stand, surrounding him."""
Yuddha Kanda,67,125,"""If we do in that way, that evil-minded demon would be harassed by the huge weight, making him to crawl on the floor and cannot kill the other monkeys."""
Yuddha Kanda,67,126,"Hearing those words of that intelligent Lakshmana, those monkeys were rejoiced and mounted on the body of Kumbhakarna."
Yuddha Kanda,67,127,"Kumbhakarna, when climbed upon by the monkeys, was enraged and shook them off with violence, as a vicious elephant would shake off its mahout."
Yuddha Kanda,67,128,"Seeing the monkeys shaken down, Rama on his part understanding that he was enraged, jumped up speedily towards the demon and took an excellent bow."
Yuddha Kanda,67,129,"The heroic Rama, enraged with red-hot eyes, as though he was scorching the enemy with his looks, walked with speed, causing delight to all the leaders of the monkey-troops, who were tormented with the fear of Kumbhakarna and quickly marched towards the demon."
Yuddha Kanda,67,130,"Taking in his hand, a terrific bow with a firmly fastened cord looking like a snake and looking variegated with its crust of gold, with a quiver full of excellent arrows fastened on his back and fully restoring the monkeys to confidence, that Rama quickly marched forward."
Yuddha Kanda,67,131,"That mighty and heroic Rama, who was highly unconquerable, accompanied by Lakshmana, duly marched forward, surrounded by those troops of monkeys."
Yuddha Kanda,67,132,"The mighty Rama saw the powerful Kumbhakarna, the annihilator of enemies, wearing a crown and his eyes blood-red with anger."
Yuddha Kanda,67,133,"Rama saw the angry Kumbhakarna, chasing all, like the mythical elephant guarding one of the quarters, searching for the monkeys, enraged as he was and surrounded by the demons."
Yuddha Kanda,67,134,"Rama saw that Kumbhakarna, looking like Vindhya and Mandara mountains, adorned with armlets of gold, emitting blood from his mouth and appearing as a rising rainy cloud."
Yuddha Kanda,67,135,"Rama saw that Kumbhakarna, who was licking the corners of his mouth which were bathed in blood, all they way trampling the monkeys and resembling Yama in the form of all-destroying time."
Yuddha Kanda,67,136,"Seeing that Kumbhakarna, the foremost of demons, having a splendour of blazing fire, Rama, the excellent of men, then stretched his bow."
Yuddha Kanda,67,137,"Enraged by the twang of Rama's bow, Kumbhakarna, the foremost of demons, not tolerating that sound, ran towards Rama."
Yuddha Kanda,67,138,"Thereupon, Rama spoke to the dashing Kumbhakarna looking like a cloud driven by the wind, whose arms were like the coils of Vasuki (the king of serpents) and appearing like a mountain in the battle-field (as follows):"
Yuddha Kanda,67,139,"""O leader of the demons! Come on. Do not regret. I sand, wielding a bow in my hand. Know me to be the annihilator of the race of demons. You will be dead within a moment."""
Yuddha Kanda,67,140,"Coming to know that he was Rama, Kumbhakarna laughed in a rebellious tone and ran up enraged towards the monkeys, driving them away in the battle-field."
Yuddha Kanda,67,141,"That Kumbhakarna of great splendour, as though bursting the hearts of all the monkeys, laughed unnaturally as also awfully and spoke the following words to Rama:"
Yuddha Kanda,67,142,"'I am neither to be considered as Viradha nor Kabandha nor Khara nor Vali nor Maricha. It is Kumbhakarna who arrived here."""
Yuddha Kanda,67,143,"""See my large terrific hammer, completely made of iron. By it, the celestials and the demons were conquered by me before."""
Yuddha Kanda,67,144,"""You need not treat me with contempt, as I am deprived of my ear and nose. To me, there is no agony even indeed a little, for having lost the ear and the nose."""
Yuddha Kanda,67,145,"""O faultless excellent Rama born in Ikshavaku dynasty! Show your prowess on my limbs. After seeing your strength and prowess, I will be devouring you."""
Yuddha Kanda,67,146,"Hearing the words of Kumbhakarna, that Rama released plumed arrows. Even after struck by them, whose speed was equal to a thunderbolt, that demon was neither shaken nor afflicted."
Yuddha Kanda,67,147,"Those arrows, which chopped off the Sala trees and killed Vali the foremost of monkeys, could not torment Kumbhakarna's body which was like a thunderbolt."
Yuddha Kanda,67,148,"Sucking those arrows with his body, as mountains suck up torments of water, that Kumbhakarna, flourishing his hammer with terrible speed, hindered the tremendous speed of Rama's arrows."
Yuddha Kanda,67,149,"Then, flourishing that hammer which was smeared with blood and which can frighten the great army of celestials, in terrific speed, that demon scared away the army of monkeys."
Yuddha Kanda,67,150,"Thereupon, taking a great missile called Vayavya, Rama hurled it on the demon. By that weapon, he chopped off Kumbhakarna's arm along with the hammer. With his arm chopped off, Kumbhakarna roared tumultuously."
Yuddha Kanda,67,151,"That Kumbhakarna's arm, identical to a mountain-peak, which was chopped off by Rama's arrow, fell along with the hammer on that army of Sugreeva and killed that regiment of monkeys."
Yuddha Kanda,67,152,"Those monkeys who had escaped being broken and slain by that arm, though dejected with their tormented limbs and taking recourse to the sides, witnessed a highly terrific encounter between Rama and Kumbhakarna."
Yuddha Kanda,67,153,"Having an arm chopped off by the arrow like a mountain-peak chopped off by a gigantic sword, that Kumbhakarna with his another arm, pulled up a tree by its roots and then ran towards Rama the lord of men in that battle-front."
Yuddha Kanda,67,154,"By his arrow, which was made variegated by gold and furnished with a mystic spell of Indra used for charming it, Rama chopped off Kumbhakarna's remaining arm, appearing like the coil of a serpent along with his uprooted palm-tree."
Yuddha Kanda,67,155,"That Kumbhakarna's arm, which appeared like a hill, was chopped off and fell down on the ground. Wallowing hither and thither, it dashed with trees, rocks, monkeys and demons."
Yuddha Kanda,67,156,"Seeing Kumbhakarna with his arms chopped off, abruptly with a roar, coming upon him and taking two sharp arrows with a shape of a half-moon each, Rama chopped off the feet of the demon in that battle."
Yuddha Kanda,67,157,"Creating a resound everywhere in all directions, even in hill-caves, in the great ocean, in Lanka as also in the armies of monkeys and demons, Kumbhakarna's feet fell down."
Yuddha Kanda,67,158,"Widely opening his mouth like the mouth of a submarine fire and roaring, Kumbhakarna whose arms and feet were cut off, ran (with thighs) quickly towards Rama, like Rahu the seizer-demon going to seize the moon in the sky."
Yuddha Kanda,67,159,"Rama filled up Kumbhakarna's mouth with sharply pointed arrows, having shafts covered with gold. With his mouth full of arrows, Kumbhakarna was unable to speak. He moaned with difficulty and even became unconscious."
Yuddha Kanda,67,160,"Thereupon, that Rama got hold of an arrow spelled with a missile presided over by Indra the lord of celestials, effulgent as sun's rays, resembling the rod of Brahma the lord of creation as also the destructive Kala, the Time-Spirit, and having its speed equal to the wind."
Yuddha Kanda,67,161,"Rama discharged against the demon, that arrow, whose shaft was inlaid with diamonds and gold, which was shining as the dazzling sun and fire set ablaze, and which vied with the speed of Indra's thunderbolt."
Yuddha Kanda,67,162,"That arrow, propelled by Rama's arm, with a terrific aspect like the smokeless fire, having a formidable energy of Indra's thunderbolt and illuminating the ten quarters with its own splendour, proceeded forward."
Yuddha Kanda,67,163,"That Rama slashed Kumbhakarna's head, which was looking like a huge mountain-peak, having well-rounded tusks and with charming and quivering ear-rings, as like Indra the destroyer of strong-holds, in the past, chopped off the head of Vritra, the demon of darkness and drought."
Yuddha Kanda,67,164,"The large Kumbhakarna's head, adorned with ear-rings, shone like the moon being in the middle, when the constellation, Punarvasu (presided over by Aditi the mother of gods and consisting of twin-stars) has risen at the night."
Yuddha Kanda,67,165,"That demon's head, equal in size to a mountain, struck by Rama's arrow, fell down. It broke the buildings on the king's high-way and their gates as also threw down that high rampart."
Yuddha Kanda,67,166,"Then, that colossal demon of a great splendour fell into the sea. It crushed the principal alligators, beautiful fishes as also snakes and entered the bowels of the earth."
Yuddha Kanda,67,167,"While that mighty Kumbhakarna, the enemy of brahmanas and celestials was killed in battle, the earth and mountains shook. Even the celestials raised a tumultuous roar with joy."
Yuddha Kanda,67,168,"Then, saints of the celestial class, great sages*, serpents, gods, genii, Suparnas (a class of bird-like beings of a semi-divine character), Guhyakas (another class of demi-gods), including troops of Yakshas and Gandharvas (celestial musicians) standing in the sky, were rejoiced at Rama's prowess."
Yuddha Kanda,67,169,"Thereupon, at the mere sight of Rama, Ravana's relatives were perturbed at the killing of Ravana of great intelligence and loudly roared, as elephants roar at the sight of a lion."
Yuddha Kanda,67,170,"Having destroyed Kumbhakarna in battle, that Rama shone in the midst of the army of monkeys, in the same way as the sun shines in the midst of the celestial world, having destroyed darkness, duly getting delivered from the mouth of Rahu."
Yuddha Kanda,67,171,"Several monkeys were highly rejoiced, with their faces flowing like full-blown lotuses. They adored Rama, who was dangerous to be attacked and as a beloved young man, killed an enemy possessing a terrible strength."
Yuddha Kanda,67,172,"By killing Kumbhakarna, who tormented the army of celestials and who was not defeated at any time in great battles, Rama was rejoiced in the same way as Indra the lord of celestials was rejoiced in killing Vritra, the great demon."
Yuddha Kanda,68,1,"Seeing that the great-souled Rama killed Kumbhakarna, the demons reported the matter to Ravana, the king of demons (as follows):"
Yuddha Kanda,68,2,"""O king! That Kumbhakarna, looking like Yama the god of death, driving away the army of monkeys and devouring some monkeys, met with death, the time's act."""
Yuddha Kanda,68,3,"""Showing his prowess for a moment, Kumbhakarna your brother, was extinguished by the fiery energy of Rama. Injured by Rama's arrows, Kumbhakarna who was looking like a mountain became an ugly mass, with his body discharging blood, as his nose and ears were cut off, resembling a tree scorched by a forest-fire, with his trunk half-submerged in a terribly looking sea and obstructing the main gate of Lanka."""
Yuddha Kanda,68,4,"Hearing that the mighty Kumbhakarna was killed in battle, Ravana was tormented with grief and fell down, fainted."
Yuddha Kanda,68,5,"Hearing that his paternal uncle was killed; Devantaka, Narantaka, Trishira and Atikaya were afflicted with sorrow and wept."
Yuddha Kanda,68,6,"Hearing that Kumbhakarna, their brother was killed by Rama, who was unwary in his actions, Mahodara and Mahaparshva (step-brothers of Kumbhakarna) were overcome with grief."
Yuddha Kanda,68,7,"Then, recovering his consciousness with difficulty, distressed as he was for the killing of Kumbhakarna and perplexed in mind, Ravana the foremost of demons, lamented (as follows):"
Yuddha Kanda,68,8,"""Alas! O hero, destroying the pride of enemies! O mighty Kumbhakarna! Leaving me behind, you have gone by divine will to the abode of Yama the lord of death."""
Yuddha Kanda,68,9,"""O mighty Kumbhakarna! Where are you going alone, leaving me behind, after having tormented the army of enemies and without taking away the thorn of grief from relatives and me."""
Yuddha Kanda,68,10,"""Indeed I shall no longer live now, that this right hand of mine, taking refuge on when I had no fear of celestials and ogres, has fallen down."""
Yuddha Kanda,68,11,"""How such a hero, who destroyed the pride of celestials and demons, as also who was an image of fire that was to destroy the world, was killed by Rama today in battle?"""
Yuddha Kanda,68,12,"""Having been afflicted by Rama's arrows, how are you, whom not even a clash of a thunder-bolt ever caused any fall, falling now insensibly on the earth's surface?"""
Yuddha Kanda,68,13,"""Seeing you killed in battle, these troops of celestials and sages, standing in the sky, are shouting with rejoice."""
Yuddha Kanda,68,14,"""It is doubly sure that the monkeys, having achieved their purpose, will be rejoiced and now itself will ascend the inaccessible door-ways of Lanka here from all sides."""
Yuddha Kanda,68,15,"""I have nothing to do with a kingdom and what shall I do with Seetha? I have no intention to live, bereft of Kumbhakarna."""
Yuddha Kanda,68,16,"""If I cannot kill Rama, who killed my brother, in battle, I would indeed prefer death, but in no case this useless life which has no meaning."""
Yuddha Kanda,68,17,"""Now itself, I will go to that place, where my younger brother is there. I do not wish to live even for a moment, after abandoning my brothers."""
Yuddha Kanda,68,18,"""Seeing me, who did harm to them in the past, the celestials will indeed mock me. O Kumbhakarna! Now that you are dead, how can I conquer Indra the lord of celestials?"""
Yuddha Kanda,68,19,"""Those words of that great-souled Vibhishana, which I did not accept due to ignorance, have come true."""
Yuddha Kanda,68,20,"""Ever since this cruel end of Kumbhakarna and Prahasta has happened, I am feeling shameful."""
Yuddha Kanda,68,21,"""Since that venerable Vibhishana, my pious brother was banished by me, this bitter fruit of that painful deed has come to me."""
Yuddha Kanda,68,22,"Having thus lamented very much piteously in various ways on coming to know that Kumbhakarna, his younger brother and the enemy of Indra having been killed, Ravana the ten-headed demon, whose inner feelings were agitated, even sank down, extremely disturbed."
Yuddha Kanda,69,1,"Hearing the words of the evil-minded Ravana, who was thus lamenting, as he was overcome with grief, Trishira (one of his sons) spoke as follows:"
Yuddha Kanda,69,2,"""Truly in such a manner, the highly valiant Kumbhakarna, (the middle of our father and uncles) has been killed. But good persons like you do not lament as you are doing, O king!"""
Yuddha Kanda,69,3,"""O Lord! You are capable of conquering even the three worlds. Why are you, as such, lamenting about yourself, as a common person?"""
Yuddha Kanda,69,4,"""You do continue to have a javelin given by Brahma, an armour, a bow and an arrow together with a chariot yoked to a thousand donkeys, emitting a sound resembling the rumbling of a cloud."""
Yuddha Kanda,69,5,"""The celestials and giants were indeed destroyed several times by you with your various types of weapons. As such, you can punish Rama, when endowed with all weapons."""
Yuddha Kanda,69,6,"""You stay on, O monarch! I will set out and eradicate your enemies in battle, as Garuda the eagle eradicates the serpents."""
Yuddha Kanda,69,7,"""Beaten down by me, as Shambara by Indra and Naraka* by Vishnu, I will lay down Rama today in battle."""
Yuddha Kanda,69,8,"Hearing the words of Trishira, Ravana the king of demons considered himself as though born anew, after being summoned by Death."
Yuddha Kanda,69,9,"Hearing the words of Trishira, Devantaka, Narantaka and the energetic Atikaya were rejoiced of war."
Yuddha Kanda,69,10,"Then, the brave Ravana's sons, whose prowess was equal to Indra and the foremost of demons, roared asserting their superiority saying ""I will lead, I will lead!"""
Yuddha Kanda,69,11,All of them wee capable of passing through the sky. All were skilled in magic. All had humbled the pride of gods. All were fierce in battle.
Yuddha Kanda,69,12,All were endowed with great strength. All were widely renowned. All were such as had never been heard of having been conquered by celestials or Gandharvas or Kinnaras or large serpents while encountering a battle.
Yuddha Kanda,69,13,"All the demons were valiant ones, well-versed in weaponry. All were skilled in war-fare. All were greatly knowledgeable and all had obtained boons."
Yuddha Kanda,69,14,"That Ravana the king, surrounded by his sons, who were radiant as the sun and who tormented the strength and fortune of the enemies, shone like Indra surrounded by celestials who can destroy the pride of gigantic demons."
Yuddha Kanda,69,15,"Embracing his sons, embellishing them with ornaments and blessing them profusely, Ravana sent them to battle."
Yuddha Kanda,69,16,"For the defense of his sons, Ravana sent Yuddhonmatta and Matta (better known as Mahodara and Mahaparshva), his brothers to the battle."
Yuddha Kanda,69,17,"Those demons with colossal bodies, paid obeisance (by circumambulating) to Ravana (who caused the people to cry in terror) and departed."
Yuddha Kanda,69,18,"Anointing their bodies with all types of herbs and perfumes, those six mighty and excellent demons went away, eager to fight."
Yuddha Kanda,69,19,"Trishira, Atikaya, Devantaka, Narantaka, Mahodara and Mahaparshva, under the clout of destiny; set out for the battle."
Yuddha Kanda,69,20,"Thereupon, Mahodara mounted an elephant called Sudarshana, like unto a dark-cloud and born in Airavata-race."
Yuddha Kanda,69,21,"That Mahodara, adorned with quivers, endowed with all types of armoury and mounting the elephant, shone like the sun on the peak of Ashtachala mountain."
Yuddha Kanda,69,22,"Trishira, the son of Ravana, ascended an exquisite chariot, yoked to excellent horses and filled with all types of armoury."
Yuddha Kanda,69,23,"Trishira, wielding a bow and mounting the chariot, shone like a cloud with glittering meteors, illuminations and a rain-bow."
Yuddha Kanda,69,24,"That Trishira with three diadems in that exquisite chariot, stood out like Mount Himavat, the king of mountains with its three golden hills."
Yuddha Kanda,69,25,"Then, Atikaya, having very fiery energy, the son of Ravana and the foremost among the wielders of bow, mounted an excellent chariot."
Yuddha Kanda,69,26,"Atikaya mounted that chariot, having first-rate wheels and axles, well-yoked, having a good carriage and pole, filled with quivers and bows and flashingly full of missiles, swords and maces."
Yuddha Kanda,69,27,"He was radiant with his diadem, shining in brilliant gold and other ornaments, like Mount Meru, causing to shine with its splendours (by the sun)."
Yuddha Kanda,69,28,"In that chariot, Atikaya that mighty prince, surrounded by the foremost of demons, shone like Indra surrounded by celestials."
Yuddha Kanda,69,29,"Narantaka mounted a white gigantic horse, similar to Uchchaishrava (the mount of Indra), adorned with gold ornaments and as swift as thought."
Yuddha Kanda,69,30,"Narantaka, holding a javelin, which was resplendent like a meteor, appeared shining, like Guha (the offspring of Shiva) holding a spear and riding a beautiful peacock."
Yuddha Kanda,69,31,"Devantaka, holding a glided iron-bar, marched ahead, resembling an incarnation of Vishnu holding Mandara-mountain in his arms."
Yuddha Kanda,69,32,"Mahaparshva, possessing a great splendour and vigour and wielding a mace in his arm in battle, looked like Kubera the lord of wealth."
Yuddha Kanda,69,33,"Those distinguished demons set out from. Lanka, like the gods leaving Amaravati. Mighty demons, holding excellent weaponry, accompanied them, mounting on elephants, horses and chariots making sounds of rumbling clouds."
Yuddha Kanda,69,34,"Those mighty princes, having sun's brilliance, wearing diadems and possessed of prosperity, shone like glowing planets in the sky."
Yuddha Kanda,69,35,"The row of auspicious attire worn by them, shone like an autumnal cloud or like a flock of cranes in the sky."
Yuddha Kanda,69,36,"Determined either to die or to vanquish their enemies, those valiant demons went forward, thus making their courageous resolve, eager to fight."
Yuddha Kanda,69,37,"Those mighty demons set out with a mad conception of war, roared and made a reverberatory sound, took up arrows and dispatched them."
Yuddha Kanda,69,38,"The earth trembled as it were, by their battle-cries and clapping of arms. The sky appeared breached, by the lion's roars of the demons."
Yuddha Kanda,69,39,"Those mighty leaders of demons, having set out, were delighted to see the army of monkeys having uplifted rocks as their weapons."
Yuddha Kanda,69,40,"The mighty monkeys too saw that army of demons, which appeared like a black cloud but blazing like fire and sun on all sides, abounding with elephants, horses and chariots, made to resound with hundreds of small bells and wielding well-raised great weaponry."
Yuddha Kanda,69,41,"Seeing that army which arrived and as they got the target for their fight, the monkeys, having the great mountains uplifted, roared again and again. The monkeys, not tolerating the demons, thus shouted, standing opposite to them."
Yuddha Kanda,69,42,"Hearing the enhanced noise of the leaders of the army of monkeys, the troops of demons who were terrible in might, not tolerating the rejoice of the enemies, then made a noise more terribly."
Yuddha Kanda,69,43,"Entering that terrific army of demons, those monkey-leaders, with their raised mountains, roamed about like mountains with their peaks."
Yuddha Kanda,69,44,"Some monkeys entering the sky and some others enraged, staying on earth with trees and rocks as their weapons, wandered among the army of demons."
Yuddha Kanda,69,45,"The foremost among the monkeys, holding trees, having extensive branches, roamed about in the battle-field. That battle-front, filled with demons and monkeys, looked terrific."
Yuddha Kanda,69,46,"Those monkeys, of terrific prowess, though impeded by a flood of arrows, initiated a matchless rain of trees, rocks and mountains."
Yuddha Kanda,69,47,"In the battle, the demons and the monkeys made a noise of lion's roars. The monkeys pounded the demons with rocks."
Yuddha Kanda,69,48,"The enraged monkeys killed demons wearing armours and ornaments. Some killed valiant demons, sitting or standing in chariots and also those demons mounted on elephants and horses."
Yuddha Kanda,69,49,"Valiant monkeys struck the demons vehemently. Those foremost of demons trembled, as their bodies were attacked by mountain-peaks and blows of fists, down and roared."
Yuddha Kanda,69,50,"Those demons also pierced the foremost of monkeys with sharp arrows, striking them with spears mallets, swords, javelins and lances."
Yuddha Kanda,69,51,"There, the monkeys and demons having their limbs smeared with the blood of their foes, mowed each other with a desire to conquer each other."
Yuddha Kanda,69,52,"Thereupon, within an instant, the battle-field became dampened with blood and covered by the mountains and swords thrown by the monkeys and demons."
Yuddha Kanda,69,53,"Then the battle-field became filled with dead bodies of demons, who had an ardent passion for battle, having their colossal bodies devastated and scattered all over."
Yuddha Kanda,69,54,"The demons, already thrown down and still being thrown down, with their spears broken by the monkeys at that time, approached the monkeys and carried out a wonderful combat with their limbs, arms and legs."
Yuddha Kanda,69,55,Those foremost of demons struck the monkeys with their own corpses and the monkeys also struck the titans with their own dead bodies.
Yuddha Kanda,69,56,"Then, grabbing the rocks and mountains, those titans struck the monkeys with them. The apes too, snatching away their weapons, struck the titans."
Yuddha Kanda,69,57,The monkeys and demons fractured each other with crags and made a noise with lion's roars.
Yuddha Kanda,69,58,"The titans, having their armours broken, as struck by the apes, emitted blood at that place, like trees oozing their sap."
Yuddha Kanda,69,59,"Some monkeys in the battle-front destroyed chariot with chariots, elephants with the very elephants and horse by the very horses."
Yuddha Kanda,69,60,"The titans broke the trees and rocks of monkey-chiefs with their sharp arrows with their hoe-shaped head, those arrows with crescent-shaped head and those with spear-like head."
Yuddha Kanda,69,61,"The battle-field, filled with those mountains, broken trees and dead bodies of apes and titans, became difficult to be traversed."
Yuddha Kanda,69,62,"Reaching the battle-field and abandoning their fear, all those monkeys, with their thrilling martial arts full of pride, nay, who were having various weapons (like trees, rocks, teeth and nails) and unrepressed in spirit, carried out battle with the demons."
Yuddha Kanda,69,63,"Seeing the monkeys rejoicing in that tumultuous battle which commenced and the demons falling down, the great sages and troop of celestials emitted shouts of triumph."
Yuddha Kanda,69,64,"Meanwhile, mounting on a horse having speed equal to the wind, and taking a barbed javelin, Narantaka entered the terrific army of monkeys, as a fish entering the ocean."
Yuddha Kanda,69,65,"That valiant and mighty Narantaka, the enemy of Indra, single-handedly within an instant, rent asunder seven hundred monkeys with that shining javelin and killed that army of the foremost of monkeys."
Yuddha Kanda,69,66,"Vidyadharas, the super natural beings and great sages, saw the mighty Narantaka, seated on the back of a horse and hacking a path way for himself through the army of monkeys."
Yuddha Kanda,69,67,"His path-way was covered with a mire of flesh and blood, along with heaps of fallen-down dead-bodes of monkeys, looking like hills."
Yuddha Kanda,69,68,"Whenever the foremost of the monkeys thought of showing their valour, so often Narantaka overtook and cleaved them."
Yuddha Kanda,69,69,"He burn away the army of monkeys, as the fire burns away the forests. Even before the monkeys get time to uplift the trees and mountains, the javelin struck them and they fell down, as mountains riven by lightning."
Yuddha Kanda,69,70,"That mighty Narantaka, the destroyer of men, roamed in all directions in the battle-field, holding up his shiny javelin, ravaging in all directions like the wind ravaging the earth in a rainy season."
Yuddha Kanda,69,71,"Narantaka, a single demon, equal to so many demons, struck the armies of mokeys with his javelin, having the sun's splendour and they fell down on the earth."
Yuddha Kanda,69,72,"Narantaka, a single demon, equal to so many demons, struck the armies of mokeys with his javelin, having the sun's splendour and they fell down on the earth."
Yuddha Kanda,69,73,"Those monkeys were unable to tolerate the down-onslaught of the javelin, which was similar to the striking of a thunderbolt and they shouted with a great uproar."
Yuddha Kanda,69,74,"The images of the falling monkeys were flashing like those of falling mountains, with their peaks shattered by a thunderbolt."
Yuddha Kanda,69,75,"Those great-souled and the foremost of monkeys, who were earlier thrown down by Kumbhakarna, regained their self and approached Sugreeva."
Yuddha Kanda,69,76,"That Sugreeva, while looking on, saw the army of monkeys running away hither and thither, as they were tormented of the fear of Narantaka."
Yuddha Kanda,69,77,"To that Sugreeva who was seeing his army running away, Narantaka appeared, coming seated on the back of a horse, holding a javelin in his hand."
Yuddha Kanda,69,78,"After seeing Narantaka, the vastly splendoured Sugreeva, the king of monkeys spoke thus, to Angada, the valiant prince, having a prowess equal to Indra's (as follows):"
Yuddha Kanda,69,79,"""Go out and quickly detach the lives of this valiant demon, who is riding a horse and consuming the army of his enemies."""
Yuddha Kanda,69,80,"Hearing the words of Sugreeva his sovereign, that valiant Angada then came bouncing from his army, as the sun coming out of a cloud."
Yuddha Kanda,69,81,"Angada the excellent of monkeys, resembling a rocky mass, wearing bracelets on his upper arms, looked brilliant like a mountain with its metallic streaks."
Yuddha Kanda,69,82,"Angada the son of Vali, bereft of arms but only nails and teeth besides having a great splendour, approached Narantaka and spoke the following words:"
Yuddha Kanda,69,83,"""Stop! What can you do with these common monkeys? Throw your javelin, having the sensation equal to a thunderbolt, towards my chest."""
Yuddha Kanda,69,84,"Hearing the words of Angada, Narantaka was very much enraged. The enraged Narantaka, tightly biting his lip with his teeth, hissing like a serpent, approaching Angada and firmly holding that highly radiant javelin, then quickly released it towards Angada. That javelin broke against Angada's chest, that was as hard as a diamond and fell to the earth."
Yuddha Kanda,69,85,"Then seeing his javelin shattered, like a serpent whose powerful coils were cut off by Garuda the eagle, Angada stretched out his palm and struck the head of the horse."
Yuddha Kanda,69,86,"That mountain-like Narantaka's horse, struck by a blow of the palm, had its head shattered, feet broken, eyes and pupils put out and tongue come out. It fell down on the earth."
Yuddha Kanda,69,87,"Seeing his horse fallen down dead, Narantaka was enraged. Raising his fist, that exceedingly powerful Narantaka in battle struck Angada on his head."
Yuddha Kanda,69,88,"Then, Angada having his head shattered by the blow of the fist, heavily oozed out very hot blood, repeatedly felt a burning sensation and swooned. On regaining consciousness, he was surprised."
Yuddha Kanda,69,89,"Thereupon, the great-souled Angada, the son of Vali, clinching his fist and then with a force equal to death, rushed it against the chest of Narantaka."
Yuddha Kanda,69,90,"Having his chest deeply sunk back by that fist-blow, giving out flames and with his limbs smeared by blood, that Narantaka fell down as a mountain is broken up by the fall of a thundr-bolt."
Yuddha Kanda,69,91,"When that Narantaka of great prowess was killed by Angada in battle, the chiefs of celestials and the monkeys too then emitted a great roar of triumph in the sky."
Yuddha Kanda,69,92,"Then, that Angada, who showed that forcible means, which was very difficult to do, and which rejoiced Rama's intellect. So much so, Angada too was surprised. Thereupon Angada, of terrible acts, was infused with vigour and again showed enthusiasm in battle."
Yuddha Kanda,70,1,"Seeing Narantaka dying, Devantaka, Trishira and Mahodara the son of Pulastya the foremost of demons, wept."
Yuddha Kanda,70,2,"Mounting an excellent elephant, resembling a cloud, Mahodara hurrily attacked Angada of great energy."
Yuddha Kanda,70,3,"The strong Devantaka, tormented at his brother's calamity, then taking a terrific iron rod, ran towards Angada."
Yuddha Kanda,70,4,"Thereupon, the valiant Trishira, mounting a chariot resembling the sun and yoked with excellent horses, marched towards Angada."
Yuddha Kanda,70,5,"That Angada, being attacked by the three chief demons, who were capable of smashing the pride of celestials, uplifted a tree with its large boughs."
Yuddha Kanda,70,6,The valiant Angada hurled that large tree with big branches quickly on Devantaka as Indra the lord of celestials would a blazing thunderbolt.
Yuddha Kanda,70,7,"Trishira chopped off that tree with arrows looking like serpents. Seeing the tree chopped off, that Angada then sprang up."
Yuddha Kanda,70,8,"Thereupon, that foremost of monkeys streamed forth trees and rocks. The enraged Trishara chopped them off with his sharp arrows."
Yuddha Kanda,70,9,That Mahodra broke those trees with the tip of his club. Trishira too with his arrows attacked the valiant Angada.
Yuddha Kanda,70,10,"Marching ahead quickly towards Angada on an elephant, the enraged Mahodara struck on his chest with javelins looking like thunderbolts."
Yuddha Kanda,70,11,"Then, the enraged Devantaka with a speed, approached Angada, struck him quickly with a club and went off to a distance."
Yuddha Kanda,70,12,"Eventhough attacked at the same time by those three foremost of demons, that Angada of great prowess and splendour, did not get alarmed."
Yuddha Kanda,70,13,"The speedy and quite unconquerable Angada, acting with a great swiftness and attacking well, struck Devantaka's elephant with his palm."
Yuddha Kanda,70,14,"By that blow of Angada in battle, the eyes of that royal elephant fell down and that elephant died."
Yuddha Kanda,70,15,"Pulling out a tusk of that elephant in battle, the mighty Angada ran towards Devantaka quickly and struck him."
Yuddha Kanda,70,16,"That energetic Devantaka swayed to and fro in disorder, like a tree being tossed up by the wind and emitted plenty of blood with the colour of a lacquer."
Yuddha Kanda,70,17,"Thereafter, the strong Devantaka of great splendour, recovering his breath with a great difficulty, then struck Angada violently, by firmly holding an iron rod."
Yuddha Kanda,70,18,"Then, Angada the son of king Vali, struck by the iron rod, fell down on his knees on the earth, but again jumped up."
Yuddha Kanda,70,19,"While Angada, the son of Vali was jumping up, Trishira struck him with three terrific and straight-going arrows on his forehead."
Yuddha Kanda,70,20,"Noticing Angada being surrounded by the three demon-warriors, Hanuma and Neela went there."
Yuddha Kanda,70,21,"Thereupon, Neela then hurled a mountain-peak on Trishira. The intelligent Trishira the son of Ravana broke it by using his sharp arrows."
Yuddha Kanda,70,22,"That mountain-peak, broken into pieces by a multitude of arrows, with its split up rocks, fell down with sparks of fire and flames."
Yuddha Kanda,70,23,"Seeing Hanuma rushing with enthusiasm in the battle-front, that strong Devantaka ran towards him with his iron rod."
Yuddha Kanda,70,24,"Then, Hanuma the foremost of monkeys, while jumping up, struck on the head of Devantaka rushing upon him with his fist equal to a thunder-bolt."
Yuddha Kanda,70,25,"Then, the valiant and the strong Hanuma struck him on his head. That great ape made the demons shake with the sound."
Yuddha Kanda,70,26,"That Devantaka, the son of Ravana, with his head crushed and broken by the blow of the fist, with his teeth and eyes coming out and with his tongue hanging down, swiftly fell down dead on the earth."
Yuddha Kanda,70,27,"When that Devantaka the mighty chief of demon-warriors and the enemy of celestials was killed in battle, the enraged Trishira showered a terrible rain of sharp-pointed arrows on Neela's chest."
Yuddha Kanda,70,28,"Again mounting an elephant resembling a mountain, as the sun mounting Mandara Mountain, that enraged Mahodara on his part, caused rain of arrows to fall quickly on Neela, like rumbling cloud with a circle of lightning, showers rain on a mountain."
Yuddha Kanda,70,29,"Thereupon, by the rain of a multitude of arrows, the body of Neela the commander of the army of monkeys became blown up. Thus the mighty Mahodara then made his loosened limbs paralyzed."
Yuddha Kanda,70,30,"After regaining consciousness, Neela uplifted a mountain consisting of a number of trees and then jumping up with a great speed, struck with it on the head of Mahodara."
Yuddha Kanda,70,31,"That Mahodara, then shattered by the fall of that mountain and crushed by that large elephant too, lost his life and fell down on the earth like a mountain struck by a thunderbolt."
Yuddha Kanda,70,32,Seeing Mahodara his young paternal uncle killed. Trishira was enraged seized hold of his bow and struck Hanuma with sharp arrows.
Yuddha Kanda,70,33,"While that enraged Hanuma hurled a mountain-peak, the strong Trishira broke it into several pieces with his sharp arrows."
Yuddha Kanda,70,34,"Seeing that mountain-peak becoming useless, Hanuma then hurled a volley of trees towards Trishira in that battle-field."
Yuddha Kanda,70,35,"The valiant Trishira chopped off that volley of trees descending on him, with his sharp arrows in the sky itself and roared aloud."
Yuddha Kanda,70,36,"Then, the enraged Hanuma on his part, bouncing up, tore asunder with his nails, Trishira's horse, as a lion tears asunder a large elephant."
Yuddha Kanda,70,37,"Thereupon, Trishira the son of Ravana seizing hold of a spear, as Yama the lord of death takes in his service Kalaratri, a night of all-destroying time, hurled it on Hanuma."
Yuddha Kanda,70,38,"Capturing that spear coming like a meteor in the sky, Hanuma the foremost of monkeys broke it, even without its descending on him and roared too."
Yuddha Kanda,70,39,"Seeing that spear of a terrific form broken up by Hanuma, the monkey-troops were very much delighted and roared aloud like rumbling clouds."
Yuddha Kanda,70,40,"Thereupon, lifting up a sword, Trishira the foremost of demons them dug it into Hanuma's breast."
Yuddha Kanda,70,41,"Hurt by the thrust of the sword, the valiant Hanuma the son of wind-god, struck Trishira on his breast, with his palm."
Yuddha Kanda,70,42,"Struck by Hanuma's palm, that Trishira of great splendour fell down unconscious on the earth with the weapons slipping from his hand."
Yuddha Kanda,70,43,"Hanuma, that large ape, equal to a mountain in size, snatching away that falling sword of Trishira, roared loudly frightening all the demons there."
Yuddha Kanda,70,44,"Unable to bear that roar, the demon jumped up and struck Hanuma with his fist."
Yuddha Kanda,70,45,"Enraged as he was by the blow of Trishiras's fist, Hanuma seized hold of Trishira the foremost of demons by his head covered by his diadem."
Yuddha Kanda,70,46,"That enraged Hanuma the son of wind-god chopped off with that sharp sword, his three heads furnished with diadems and ear-rings, like Indra the lord of celestials chopped off the heads of Vishvarupa the son of Tvashta."
Yuddha Kanda,70,47,"Those mountain-like heads of Trishira the enemy of Indra, having longish organs of senses and having fire-like blazing eyes, fell down on earth, as planets and stars drop from the track of the sun."
Yuddha Kanda,70,48,"When that Trishira, the enemy of celestials, having a prowess equal to that of Indra was killed, the monkeys made a loud noise. The earth trembled. Then, the demons ran away everywhere. Seeing Trishira, Mahodara and the invincible Devantaka killed, Matta (Mahaparshva) was enraged with indignation."
Yuddha Kanda,70,49,"Then, Mahaparshva was holding a large mace, which was resplendent, completely made of iron, wound round with golden wires, filled with a froth of flesh and blood, satiated with the blood enemies, the upper most part of which was blazing with splendour, decked with red coloured garlands and which frightened the elephants supporting the quarters like Airavata, Mahapadma and Sarvabhauma."
Yuddha Kanda,70,50,"Taking that mace, the enraged Matta, the foremost of demons, went quickly to the monkeys like the blazing fire at the end of the world."
Yuddha Kanda,70,51,"Then, a strong monkey called Rishabha came jumping and stood in front of that Mattanika (Mahaparshva), the younger brother of Ravana."
Yuddha Kanda,70,52,"Enraged in seeing that Rishabha, looking like a mountain, standing before him, Mahaparshva struck him upon his breast with a mace equaling a thunderbolt."
Yuddha Kanda,70,53,"When he struck with his mace, the breast of that Rishabha the foremost of demons was broken. He then trembled and exuded blood profusely."
Yuddha Kanda,70,54,"That Rishabha, the supreme monkey regained his consciousness after a long while and enraged as he was with his lips quivering, looked towards Mahaparshva."
Yuddha Kanda,70,55,"That Rishabha, the supreme monkey regained his consciousness after a long while and enraged as he was with his lips quivering, looked towards Mahaparshva."
Yuddha Kanda,70,56,"With his body drenched in blood, that Mahaparshva suddenly fell unconscious on the ground, like a tree with its root cut off. Then, taking quickly Mahaparshva's mace, which was looking like Yama's rod, he roared loudly."
Yuddha Kanda,70,57,"Mahaparshva remained as though he was dead for a while. Springing suddenly after regaining his consciousness, that demon, whose colour resembled his consciousness, that demon, whose colour resembled an evening cloud, struck that Rishabha, the son of Varuna the lord of waters."
Yuddha Kanda,70,58,"That Rishabha fell unconscious for a while on the ground. Rising after regaining consciousness and tightly holding just the same mace, which was looking like a large mountain-peak, banged it on Mahapatra in the battle-field."
Yuddha Kanda,70,59,"That terrific mace, reaching the body of Mahaparshva, the fierce demon, the enemy of celestials, sacrificial rites and Brahmanas, broke his chest. Mahaparshva started exuding copious blood, as a supreme mountain exudes water full of minerals."
Yuddha Kanda,70,60,"The great souled Rishabha quickly ran towards the mace of that mighty Mahaparshva. Seizing that dreadful mace and striking it repeatedly on the floor, he struck it on Mahaparshva in the battle-front."
Yuddha Kanda,70,61,"Struck by his own mace, that Mahaparshva with his teeth and eyes fallen out, fell down like a mountain struck by a thunderbolt."
Yuddha Kanda,70,62,"When that demon depleted his strength, burst open his eyes, with his long life gone away and fallen down on the ground, the army of demons ran away."
Yuddha Kanda,70,63,"When that Mahaparshva was killed, that army of demons, which was as extensive as an ocean, abandoning their weapons in the battle-field, fled for mere lives, like a sea which has burst its shores."
Yuddha Kanda,71,1,"Seeing his own army making a tumultuous sound tottering with excessive fear, seeing his brothers having a prowess equal to that of Indra the lord of celestials having been killed, and seeing his paternal uncles as also Yuddhonmatta and Matta (Mahodara and Mahaparshva) his brothers and the foremost of demons having been fallen down, Atikaya of great splendour, having boons bestowed by Brahma the lord of creation, having appearance of a mountain and who removed the pride of celestials and ogres, was enraged."
Yuddha Kanda,71,2,"That Atikaya, the enemy of Indra the lord of celestials, mounting a chariot shining like a cluster of thousand suns, ran towards the monkeys."
Yuddha Kanda,71,3,"Wearing a crown and well-cleansed ear-rings as also drawing his bow, he roared with a big noise, making his name loudly heard."
Yuddha Kanda,71,4,"By that lion-like roar, making his name loudly heard and by that terrific sound of the bow-string, it created terror to the monkeys."
Yuddha Kanda,71,5,"Seeing the bulkiness of his body, all the monkeys, thinking that Kumbhakarna woke up again, took refuge with each other, afflicted as they were, with fear."
Yuddha Kanda,71,6,"Seeing his form appearing like Vishnu who strided over the three worlds in three steps, the those renowned monkey-warriors with fear, ran away hither and thither."
Yuddha Kanda,71,7,"When Atikaya was to be attacked, the monkeys were bewildered in mind and sought in the battle, a refuge with Rama, who affords protection."
Yuddha Kanda,71,8,"Then, Rama saw from a distance, Atikaya, who resembled a mountain in size, stationed in a chariot, armed with a bow and rumbling like a cloud appearing at the time of universal dissolution."
Yuddha Kanda,71,9,"Seeing that Atikaya, having a colossal body, Rama for his part was quite surprised and after consoling the monkeys, spoke to Vibhishana (as follows):"

Yuddha Kanda,71,39,"That demon, who was arrogant of his youth, frightened that army of monkey-warriors, as an enraged lion frightens a herd of deers."
Yuddha Kanda,71,40,"That chief of demons did not strike whomsoever of the monkey-warriors who were unable to fight. That Atikaya, with his bow and quiver of arrows, going up quickly towards Rama, spoke haughty words (to him) as follows:"

Yuddha Kanda,71,42,"Hearing his words, Lakshmana the annihilator of enemies was enraged. Then, unable to bear his words and smiling, he rose up quickly and took up his bow."
Yuddha Kanda,71,43,"The enraged Lakshmana, coming forward quickly and taking off an arrow from his quiver pulled out his great bow in front of Atikaya."
Yuddha Kanda,71,44,"That twang of the bow of Lakshmana, filling the entire quarters, earth, sky and the ocean, was angry, frightening the demons."

Yuddha Kanda,71,53,"Hearing the words of Atikaya, filled with anger and arrogance in that battle-field, Lakshmana was enraged. Thereafter, that Lakshmana, having a great strength wisdom and great glory, also spoke as follows:"
Yuddha Kanda,71,54,"""O the evil-minded! Just by uttering mere words, you cannot by a very important person. People cannot become good persons, just by boasting of themselves. You rather show your strength in me, who is standing with an arrow in hand and wielding a bow."""

Yuddha Kanda,71,59,"""Thinking me to be a boy, you need not disregard me. Either as the boy or as the aged, you indeed know me in battle-front as the god of Death. Vishnu, as a boy occupied the three worlds just with his three strides, Didn't he?"""
Yuddha Kanda,71,60,"Hearing the reasonable and highly meaningful words of Lakshmana, Atikaya was very much enraged and took out an excellent arrow."
Yuddha Kanda,71,61,"Then, Vidyadharas the supernatural beings, Bhutas the spirits, Devas the celestials, Daityas the demons, Maharshies the great sages and Guhyakas a class of demi-gods, all the great souled ones saw that battle."
Yuddha Kanda,71,62,"Thereafter, the enraged Atikaya, stringing an arrow to his bow, dispatched it towards Lakshmana, as though he were shrinking up the space in between."
Yuddha Kanda,71,63,"Lakshmana, the annihilator of enemy-warriors, chopped off that serpent-like sharp arrow, which was falling down on him, with his crescent-pointed arrow."
Yuddha Kanda,71,64,"Seeing that arrow which was chopped off as a snake's hood severed into pieces, Atikaya was very much enraged and fitted five arrows to his bow."
Yuddha Kanda,71,65,"That demon hurled those arrows towards Lakshmana. Even before they reached him, Lakshmana chopped them off with his sharp arrows."
Yuddha Kanda,71,66,"Cutting off those arrows with his sharp arrows that Lakshmana, the destroyer of enemy-warriors, took up a sharp arrow, as though it was blazing with a glow."
Yuddha Kanda,71,67,"Taking that arrow, Lakshmana harnessed it on his excellent bow, stretched it with force and released it."
Yuddha Kanda,71,68,"That valiant Lakshmana, by a flat-jointed arrow released fully, struck it on the forehead of that excellent demon."
Yuddha Kanda,71,69,"That arrow, sunken into the forehead of that terrible demon, smeared with blood, appeared like a serpent-king on a mountain."
Yuddha Kanda,71,70,"The demon, tormented by Lakshmana's arrow, then trembled violently as when the terrific town-gate of Tripura City, (built of gold, silver and iron in the sky, air and earth by Maya for the demons) was struck by Shiva's arrow."
Yuddha Kanda,71,71,"That demon of great strength, recovering his breath, reasoningly reflected as follows: ""Well! By flying down an arrow, you have become a commendable enemy for me."""
Yuddha Kanda,71,72,"Thus speaking with his mouth wide open, Atikaya bent down with his large shoulder, ascended the top of his chariot and roamed about hither and thither by his chariot."
Yuddha Kanda,71,73,"Atikaya, the foremost of demons, seized hold of one, three, five and seven arrows and fixed them to his bow, stretched it and released the arrows."
Yuddha Kanda,71,74,"Those arrows, released from the bow of Atikaya, the leader of demons, appearing as Death, with golden shafts and shining like the sun, set the sky ablaze."
Yuddha Kanda,71,75,"Thereupon, Lakshmana coolly chopped off those gluts of arrows released by that foremost of demons, by the multitude of his sharp arrows."
Yuddha Kanda,71,76,"That Atikaya, of great splendour, fixing that arrow to his bow and by instantly releasing it, struck the approaching Lakshmana in the middle of his chest."
Yuddha Kanda,71,77,"That Atikaya, of great splendour, fixing that arrow to his bow and by instantly releasing it, struck the approaching Lakshmana in the middle of his chest."
Yuddha Kanda,71,78,"Struck in battle by Atikaya in his chest, Lakshmana oozed out blood severely, like the fluid exuding from a rutting elephant."
Yuddha Kanda,71,79,"That powerful Lakshmana, then quickly made himself freed from that arrow-head, took up a sharp arrow and fixed it with a missile."
Yuddha Kanda,71,80,"When Lakshmana employed the missile of fire on his arrow, that arrow of the great souled Lakshmana and as also the bow, caused a flame to blaze."
Yuddha Kanda,71,81,"Atikaya of great splendour took up a solar missile and employed it on that arrow, having a golden shaft as also looking like a serpent."
Yuddha Kanda,71,82,"Meanwhile, Lakshmana hurled at Atikaya, that blazing and awful arrow employed with that mystic missile as Yama the lord of Death would hurl his rod of destruction."
Yuddha Kanda,71,83,"Seeing that arrow charged with a mystic missile of fire, Atikaya the demon then released the awful arrow charged with the solar missile."
Yuddha Kanda,71,84,"Those two arrows, having their points blazed in splendour, struck at each other in the sky, like two enraged serpents."
Yuddha Kanda,71,85,"Those two excellent arrows, eventhough they were both blazing, did not radiate any longer on the earth's surface, in that they were without a flame and had been reduced to ashes."
Yuddha Kanda,71,86,"Thereupon, the enraged Atikaya released an arrow made of cane (a missile) presided over by Tvasha (the architect of gods). Then, the valiant LakShmana chopped off that missile, by his missile presided over by Indra the lord of celestials."
Yuddha Kanda,71,87,"Seeing his arrow made of cane struck down, that young Atikaya was quite enraged and fixed his arrow with a missile presided over by Yama the lord of retribution."
Yuddha Kanda,71,88,"Thereupon, Atikaya hurled that missile on Lakshmana. That Lakshmana struck it down by a missile presided over by the wind-god."
Yuddha Kanda,71,89,"Then, the furious Lakshmana showered forth hails of arrows on Atikaya, as a rainy cloud showers hails of down-pour."
Yuddha Kanda,71,90,"Reaching Atikaya, those arrows with the points of their shafts shattered on his armour, adorned with diamonds and instantly fell on the earth's surface."
Yuddha Kanda,71,91,"Seeing those arrows becoming unsuccessful, the highly famous Lakshmana the annihilator of enemy-warriors, showered forth arrows in thousands."
Yuddha Kanda,71,92,"Atikaya, that mighty demon, though deluged with a flood of arrows, was not agitated in battle because of the inviolability of his armour."
Yuddha Kanda,71,93,"Atikaya released an arrow having a serpent-like form on Lakshmana. Struck by that arrow on his vital parts, that Lakshmana, the tormentator of his enemies, felt unconscious just for a moment."
Yuddha Kanda,71,94,"Having regained his consciousness, the mighty Lakshmana, the annihilator of enemies, with his flood of arrows threw down the flag-staff and killed the horses and the charioteer in combat, with his four excellent arrows."
Yuddha Kanda,71,95,"Free from flurry, that Lakshmana, the son of Sumitra, released those arrows, exactly aiming at that demon, for the purpose of killing him."
Yuddha Kanda,71,96,"Lakshmana, the best among men, was not able to afflict any injury to Atikaya in battle. Then, the wind-god came to him and spoke to him as follows:"
Yuddha Kanda,71,97,"""He, endowed with a boon by Brahma the lord of creation, is cloaked by inviolable armour. Split him with a missile of Brahma. He cannot be killed by any other means. The mighty Atikaya, with that armour, cannot be destroyed by other missiles."""
Yuddha Kanda,71,98,"Then, hearing the words of the wind-god, Lakshmana having a prowess equal to that of Indra the lord of celestials, adjusting his arrow with a missile presided over by Vrahma, quickly directed the arrow with a terrific force."
Yuddha Kanda,71,99,"While fixing that excellent missile on that superior sharp-pointed arrow by Lakshmana, all the quarters, the sun, the moon, the great planets and the sky were frightened. Earth also made an uproar."
Yuddha Kanda,71,100,"Having charged the missile of Brahma on that arrow with the feathers and all, equal to a messenger of Yama the lord of Death over his bow, Lakshmana released that arrow looking like a thunderbolt on Atikaya, the son of Ravana."
Yuddha Kanda,71,101,"Atikaya saw that arrow, released with augmented force by Lakshmana, moving so fastly as the wind, having beautiful wings with variegated feathers and looking like a thunderous thunderbolt, approaching him in battle."
Yuddha Kanda,71,102,"Seeing that arrow, Atikaya quickly struck with several sharp arrows. That Lakshmana's arrow, with a speed equal to Garuda the eagle, thus reached Atikaya's proximity."
Yuddha Kanda,71,103,"Seeing that blazing arrow, looking like Yama the lord of Death and black in colour, approaching him, Atikaya then struck it with spike, spear, mace, axe and arrows."
Yuddha Kanda,71,104,"Then, that arrow, blazing like fire, made in vain those weapons of wonderful form and taking Atikaya's head, carried it away."
Yuddha Kanda,71,105,"That head with its diadem, chopped off by Lakshmana, quickly fell down on the ground, like a peak of the Himalayan Mountain."
Yuddha Kanda,71,106,"Seeing Atikaya falling on the ground, with his clothes and ornaments scattered away, all the surviving demons became perturbed."
Yuddha Kanda,71,107,"Many of those depressed demons, dejected as they were, showing fatigue born of fighting, in their faces, suddenly began to shout loudly, with their voices in discordant notes."
Yuddha Kanda,71,108,"As their leader was dead, the demons were then frightened and becoming indifferent to fight, went running away all around, with their faces turned towards that City of Lanka."
Yuddha Kanda,71,109,"When the dangerous demon with the terrific strength was killed, the multitude of monkeys then were endowed with a great delight, with their faces looking like full blown lotuses and worshipped Lakshmana who got his desire fulfilled."
Yuddha Kanda,71,110,"Throwing down in battle, that Atikaya who was exceedingly strong and looking like a cloud, Lakshmana was greatly delighted and while he was being worshipped by the multitude of monkeys, thereupon quickly hastened towards the proximity of Rama."
Yuddha Kanda,72,1,"Hearing Atikaya having been killed in the hands of the great-souled Lakshmana, Ravana was worried and spoke as follows:"
Yuddha Kanda,72,2,"""Dhumraksha, who was greatly impatient Akampana who was excellent among all wielders of weapons, Prahasta and Kumbhakarna were killed by Rama, who was unwearied in battle. The mighty and valiant demons longing for battle, who conquer the adversaries, who was never defeated in battle by the enemies they along with their enemies were killed. Many other mighty warriors."
Yuddha Kanda,72,3,"""That day, Indrajit, my son, whose strength and prowess are renowned, bound both Rama and Lakshmana, the brothers with terrific arrows, on which boons had been conferred."""
Yuddha Kanda,72,4,"""That terrific bind of arrow cannot be released by any celestial or a mighty demon or by Yakshas the supernatural beings or Gandharvas the celestial musicians or Pannagas the serpent-demons. Rama and Lakshmana, the two brothers were released from that tie of arrows either by their power or by their sorcery or by their marvel I do not know that."""
Yuddha Kanda,72,5,"""All of those valiant demon-warriors set out for battle, at my command, were killed by those exceptionally mighty monkeys."""
Yuddha Kanda,72,6,"""I do not find any demon, who can destroy the valiant Rama along with Lakshmana, Sugreeva and Vibhishana accompanied by their army in battle now."""
Yuddha Kanda,72,7,"""By Rama's valour, the demons were destroyed. Alas! How great is Rama's strength! How great is the power of his arrow!"""
Yuddha Kanda,72,8,"""Some regiments of the army have to protect this City and even Ashoka garden where Seetha is being guarded, vigilantly on all sides."""
Yuddha Kanda,72,9,"""We should know the locations of army-regiments and also the places where persons are exiting and entering at all times, again and again."
Yuddha Kanda,72,10,"""O demons! Stay on all sides with your respective armies. The various positioning of those monkeys are to be watched."""
Yuddha Kanda,72,11,"""Indifference should not be shown to monkeys in any way at any time, either at evening or at midnight or at dawn. You have watch whether the army of adversaries is fervently active or advancing or staying where it was."""
Yuddha Kanda,72,12,"Hearing those words of Ravana, all the mighty demons then precisely carried it out forthwith in its totality."
Yuddha Kanda,72,13,"Having thus instructed all of them, Ravana the king of demons, suffering from prickly sorrow and depression, penetrated deeply into his palace."
Yuddha Kanda,72,14,"Blazed as he was with a fire of anger, Ravana the mighty lord of demons, then remained broading about the loss of his son (Atikaya) and also sighing again and again."
Yuddha Kanda,73,1,"Then, those surviving troops of demons hastily told Ravana that Devantaka, Trishira, Atikaya and other foremost of demons had been killed."
Yuddha Kanda,73,2,"Thereupon, suddenly hearing of those who had been killed, Ravana the prosperous king of demons, having his eyes filled with profuse tears; boarding over the terrific destroyal of his son as also the death of his brothers, contemplated for long."
Yuddha Kanda,73,3,"Then, seeing Ravana the king, miserably submerged in a sea of sorrow, Indrajit, Ravana's son, the best among charioteers, spoke to him as follows:"
Yuddha Kanda,73,4,"""O father, the king of demons! You ought not to get embarrassed, while Indrajit is alive. Anyone who is struck by Indrajit's arrows cannot indeed protect his life."""
Yuddha Kanda,73,5,"""Today, you will see Rama along with Lakshmana, with their bodies undistinguished, scattered and dead, lying down on the floor, with their limbs diffused all over."""
Yuddha Kanda,73,6,"""Listen to Indrajit's promise, which is very firm, backed by valour and divine blessing. Now itself, I will overwhelm Rama together with Lakshmana unfailing flood of arrows."
Yuddha Kanda,73,7,"""Now itself, Indra, Yama, Vishnu, Rudra, Sadhyas (a class of celestial beings), the fire-god, the sun and the moon can see my unlimited prowess, like the terrific prowess of Vishnu (in his dwarf incarnation as Vamana) in the enclosure where a sacrifice was being performed by Bali, the demon-king."""
Yuddha Kanda,73,8,"Thus speaking, that Indrajit, with an undepressed mind, after seeking permission from the king, mounted his chariot with a speed equal to that of wind and yoked with excellent donkeys."
Yuddha Kanda,73,9,"That greatly resplendent Indrajit, the annihilator of enemies, having ascended a chariot looking like the chariot of the sun, quickly went to the battle-front."
Yuddha Kanda,73,10,"Many mighty demons with terrific prowess, with joy, holding excellent bows in their hands, carrying lances, sharp-edged spears, swords, axes and maces as also armed with Bhushundis (probably a kind of fire arms), mallets, cudgels, Shataghnis (cylindrical piece of wood studded with iron spikes) and iron rods, followed that great souled Indrajit. Some rode on the back of elephants, some ascended excellent horses, tigers, scorpions, cats, donkeys and camels, looking."
Yuddha Kanda,73,11,That valiant Indrajit swiftly went to the battle-field with full blasts of couches and kettle-drums.
Yuddha Kanda,73,12,"Indrajit, the tormentator of enemies, with a parasol white as a couch and the moon, shone like the sky with the full moon."
Yuddha Kanda,73,13,"The valiant Indrajit, the foremost among all the wielders of bow and decked with gold ornaments, was being fanned then with supremely charming whisks with handles of gold."
Yuddha Kanda,73,14,"Seeing that son setting out with a large army, that glorious Ravana, the king of demons, spoke as follows:"
Yuddha Kanda,73,15,"""O my dear son! There is no charioteer who can stand you as your rival. Indra the lord of celestials was conquered by you. You can kill Rama, a mere human being, who is assailable. How much more can I tell?"" After hearing these words of Ravana Indrajit accepted his great blessings."
Yuddha Kanda,73,16,"With that Indrajit, having a splendour equal to that of the sun and having no warrior who can stand him as his rival, the City of Lanka shone, like the sky shining with the sun."
Yuddha Kanda,73,17,"Reaching the battle-field, Indrajit of great splendour, the annihilator of enemies, stationed his demons around his chariot."
Yuddha Kanda,73,18,"Then, that foremost of demons, having a radiance equal to that of fire, with excellent sacrificial incantations, performed a sacrifice, as per rules, making an oblation to the fire."
Yuddha Kanda,73,19,"That valiant leader of demons offered oblations to fire there, with garlands and pounded sandalwood, including clarified butter and parched grain."
Yuddha Kanda,73,20,"That sacrificial rite was performed with weapons serving as reeds, chips of Vibhishaka tree serving as fuel, then using red pieces of cloth and the sacrificial ladle made of iron."
Yuddha Kanda,73,21,"Duly spreading fire with reeds (in the form of other weapons) accompanied by lances there, Indrajit elapsed the neck of a live goat of dark hue (for offering it to the fire as an oblation)."
Yuddha Kanda,73,22,"From the great fire of flames, set ablaze by that offering having been thrown into it acting at once without smoke, appeared such signs as had beckoned victory (of the past)."
Yuddha Kanda,73,23,"The fire, resembling the molten gold, rising up on its own and having flames revolving from left to right, accepted that oblation."
Yuddha Kanda,73,24,"Indrajit, who was skilled in the use of mystic missiles, invoked the missile presided over by Brahma and charged it on his bow, chariot and all."
Yuddha Kanda,73,25,"While that missile was being invoked and the sacrificial fire propitiated, the firmament including the sun, the moon, other planets and lunar mansions trembled with fear."
Yuddha Kanda,73,26,"Having propitiated offering in fire, Indrajit, having a splendour shining like the fire, having a might similar to that of Indra, and possessing an unimaginable prowess, became himself invisible in the sky, with the bow, arrows, sword, chariot, horses, charioteer and all."
Yuddha Kanda,73,27,"Then, the army of demons, extensive with horses and chariots, embellished by banners and flags, set out with a desire to fight, roaring."
Yuddha Kanda,73,28,"They killed the monkeys in the battle-field with many wonderful and ornamental arrows, possessing great velocity as also lances and goads."
Yuddha Kanda,73,29,"Seeing those demons, the most enraged Indrajit on his part spoke to them as follows: ""All of you fight enthusiastically with an intent to kill the monkeys."""
Yuddha Kanda,73,30,"Roaring with a desire for victory, all those demons thereafter terribly rained showers of arrows on monkeys."
Yuddha Kanda,73,31,"That Indrajit, on his part, along with his demons in the battle-field, destroyed the monkeys with Nalika (broad-headed) arrows, steel arrows, maces and clubs."
Yuddha Kanda,73,32,"Those monkeys, wielding trees as their weapons, being struck in the battle-field, quickly rained mountains and trees on Indrajit."
Yuddha Kanda,73,33,"Indrajit the son of Ravana, on his part, possessing great splendour and great strength, was enraged and wounded the bodies of the monkeys."
Yuddha Kanda,73,34,"Bringing enormous delight to the demons that enraged Indrajit severed off the monkeys by nines, fives and sevens with a single arrow."
Yuddha Kanda,73,35,"That most invincible chief of demons, with arrows decked with gold, having brilliance equal to the sun, destroyed the monkeys in battle."
Yuddha Kanda,73,36,"Those monkeys, tormented by the arrows in battle, with their limbs severed, fell down with their aspirations shaken, like the great demons fallen down by the celestials."
Yuddha Kanda,73,37,"Those excellent monkeys with anger attacked Indrajit, who was tormenting them like the sun with his terrific ray-like the sun with his terrific ray-like arrows."
Yuddha Kanda,73,38,"Then, all the monkeys, with their bodies severed, having lost their consciousness and perturbed as they were, having their limbs dampened with blood, took to their heels."
Yuddha Kanda,73,39,"Those monkeys, wielding mountains as their weapons, roaring in the battle field, without turning back, abandoned their lives, showing their courage for the sake of Rama."
Yuddha Kanda,73,40,"Continuing to stay in the battle-field, those monkeys rained trees, mountain-peaks and rocks on Indrajit."
Yuddha Kanda,73,41,"Indrajit of great splendour and the conqueror of battles, kept off that great rain of deadly hail of trees and rocks."
Yuddha Kanda,73,42,"Thereupon, the capable Indrajit with his arrows, identical of fire and looking like serpents in battle, split the armies of monkeys."
Yuddha Kanda,73,43,"Indrajit struck Gandhamadana with eighteen sharp arrows and also struck Neela, who was standing at a far-away place, with nine arrows."
Yuddha Kanda,73,44,"Indrajit having a great prowess, struck Mainda with seven arrows, which can tear asunder vital parts and also struck Gaja with five arrows in battle."
Yuddha Kanda,73,45,"Indrajit then struck Jambavan with ten arrows and Nila with thirty arrows. He also struck Sugreeva, Rishabha, Angada and Dvivida with sharp and terrific arrows endowed with boons and made them breathless."
Yuddha Kanda,73,46,"That enraged Indrajit, then looking like an excited fire that is to destroy the world, tormented other chiefs of monkeys too with many arrows."
Yuddha Kanda,73,47,He harassed the armies of monkeys' fast-moving arrows looking like the sun in their splendour.
Yuddha Kanda,73,48,"That enthusiastic Indrajit, with a great pleasure, saw that exclusive army of monkeys, drenched in blood and tormented by a multitude of arrows."
Yuddha Kanda,73,49,"Indrajit, the son of Ravana, possessing a great splendour power and strength, again generating a terrific rain of arrows and weapons, destroyed the army of monkeys from all sides."
Yuddha Kanda,73,50,"Leaving off his army from that great battle-field and becoming invisible, Indrajit advanced towards the monkeys and quickly rained terrific hail of arrows on those armies of monkeys, as black cloud downpours the rain."
Yuddha Kanda,73,51,"In that battle, those mountain-like monkeys as victims of conjuring tricks with their bodies torn into pieces by Indrajit's arrows and roaring as they were with discordant notes, fell down on earth, like mountains struck by Indra's thunder bolt."
Yuddha Kanda,73,52,"Those monkeys in battle saw only arrows with pointed tips falling on the armies of monkeys. They could not see there, that Indrajit the demon, the enemy of Indra, remaining concealed by his conjuring trick."
Yuddha Kanda,73,53,"Then, the mighty Indrajit, the leader of demons, covered all the quarters with hundreds of sharply pointed arrows, having splendour of the sun and tore asunder the monkey-chiefs."
Yuddha Kanda,73,54,"Indrajit excessively rained on the army of monkeys' pikes, swords and axes, shining like augmented and flaming fire and shooting forth incandescent flames with sparks."
Yuddha Kanda,73,55,"Struck by the Indrajit's arrows, shining brightly as fire, the monkey-commanders then looked like Kimshuka trees bearing crimson flowers."
Yuddha Kanda,73,56,"Those excellent monkeys, torn asunder by that chief of demons, approaching at each other and roaring in a discordant tone, fell down on the ground."
Yuddha Kanda,73,57,"Banged in the eyes by arrows, some monkeys looking up towards the sky, joined each other and fell down on the floor."
Yuddha Kanda,73,58,"With lances, spikes and sharp arrows, charged with sacred texts, Indrajit the excellent demon struck all those foremost of monkeys, namely Hanuman, Sugreeva, Angada, Gandhamadana, Jambavan, Sushena, Vegadarshina, Mainda, Dvivida, Nila, Gavaksha, Gavaya, Kesari, Hariloma, Vidyuddamshtra, Suryanana, Jyothimukha, a monkey called Dadhimukha, Pavakaksha, Nala as also a monkey named Kumuda."
Yuddha Kanda,73,59,"Tearing asunder the principal monkey-warriors by maces and arrows, which were of golden colour, that Indrajit rained a multitude of showers of arrows equal to sun's rays on Rama and Lakshmana."
Yuddha Kanda,73,60,"Ignoring that showering rain of arrows, as though they are mere showers of rain, that Rama of the most wonderful luster, looking around thoroughly, then spoke to Lakshmana as follows:"
Yuddha Kanda,73,61,"""O Lakshmana! This Indrajit, by a great missile, is throwing down our army of monkeys and tormenting us incessantly with his sharp arrows."""
Yuddha Kanda,73,62,"""How can the mighty and composed Indrajit on whom a boon has been bestowed by Brahma and who has concealed his terrible form who stands with his weapons uplifted eventhough his body is visible be killed in the battle today?"
Yuddha Kanda,73,63,"""I think the self-born Brahma who is the source of the universe is inconceivable and this missile is presided over by him. O wise one! Remaining undistracted in mind, you bear along with me today the hail of arrows here."""
Yuddha Kanda,73,64,"""Let this chief of demons, who is surpassing all, be covered with a multitude of showers of arrows. This entire army of Sugreeva, whose leading warriors have fallen, looks no more charming."""
Yuddha Kanda,73,65,"""Finding both of us fallen unconscious without displaying any joy or anger as also having desisted from fighting, Indrajit will certainly return to Lanka, after having obtained laurels of battle in its beginning itself."""
Yuddha Kanda,73,66,"Thereafter, Rama and Lakshmana there became struck by a multitude of arrows of Indrajit. That leader of demons also there, causing affliction to both of them, roared with a thrill of rapture in battle."
Yuddha Kanda,73,67,"Thus causing the army of monkeys along with Rama and Lakshmana to become despondent in battle, that Indrajit, getting eulogized by the demons, quickly reached the city of Lanka which was being protected by Ravana's arms. Then, Indrajit cheerfully informed all that had happened, to his father."
Yuddha Kanda,74,1,"Then, in the battle-front, Rama and Lakshmana were knocked down senseless. The army of monkey-leaders fainted. Sugreeva, Nila, Angada and Jambavan could not understand what to do."
Yuddha Kanda,74,2,"Seeing the entire army looking worried, Vibhishana, the best among the intelligent ones, spoke the following matchless words, consoling the warriors of Sugreeva, the lord of monkeys:"
Yuddha Kanda,74,3,"""Honouring the spell sacred of Brahma the creator, the two sons of the venerable Dasaratha have actually lost their free will and became dejected and have allowed themselves to be knocked down by the missiles of Indrajit. Hence do not be afraid. There is no occasion for despondency now."""
Yuddha Kanda,74,4,"""This excellent missile, presided over by Brahma the creator, with never-failing strength, was given to Indrajit by Brahma. Honouring it, Rama and Lakshmana the princes fell down in battle. This not a time for despondency here."""
Yuddha Kanda,74,5,"Then, the intelligent Hanuma, the son of wind-god, paying honour to the missile presided over by Brahma and hearing the words of Vibhishana, spoke the following words:"
Yuddha Kanda,74,6,"""Let us restore to confidence whosoever is in this army of energetic monkeys, after having been struck by the missile."""
Yuddha Kanda,74,7,"Both those valiant ones, Hanuma and Vibhishana, together at that time of the night, roamed about in the battle-front, with torches in their hands."
Yuddha Kanda,74,8,"Hanuma and Vibhishana saw the battle-field, covered on all sides, with mountain-sized monkeys fallen with heir tails, arms, thighs, feet, fingers and heaps of heads fractured with blood oozing from their limbs and urine flowing out. The earth was also covered with flaming weapons fallen around."
Yuddha Kanda,74,9,"Vibhishana and Hanuma saw Sugreeva, Angada, Nila, Sharabha, Gandhamadana, Gavaksha, Sushena, Vegadarshi, Mainda, Nala, Jyotimukha and a monkey called Dvivida, who were struck down on the battle-field."
Yuddha Kanda,74,10,"Sixty seven crores of powerful monkeys were struck down by the cherished missile of Brahma, the self-born creator, in the fifth and last period* of the day."
Yuddha Kanda,74,11,"Hanuma, along with Vibhishana, began to search for Jambavan, while looking at the terrific army (wounded by the arrows) which appeared like the tide of an ocean."
Yuddha Kanda,74,12,"Looking at Jambavan, the son of Brahma, who was naturally bequeathed with old age, an elderly person, with his body conspicuous of hundreds of arrows and a valiant person looking like an extinguishing fire, Vibhishana approached him and spoke as follows:"
Yuddha Kanda,74,13,"""O Vibhishana, the leader of demons, with a great prowess! I am able to recognize you by your voice alone. Pierced with sharp arrows, I am not able to see you with my eyes."""
Yuddha Kanda,74,14,"""O Vibhishana, of good manners! Does Hanuma, the foremost among monkeys, because of whom, Anjana (his mother) and the wind-god are his blessed parents survive, holding his life any where nearby?"""
Yuddha Kanda,74,15,"Hearing the words of Jambavana, Vibhishana spoke the following words, ""why do you enquire about Hanuman, passing over the venerable sons of Dasaratha?"""
Yuddha Kanda,74,16,"""O venerable one! The exceptional affection, you are showing towards Hanuma, is not being shown towards Sugreeva or Angada or even Rama."""
Yuddha Kanda,74,17,"Hearing the words of Vibhishana, Jambavan replied as follows: ""O the foremost among demons! Listen to me, why I am enquiring about Hanuma."""
Yuddha Kanda,74,18,"""If that brave Hanuma is surviving, the whole army even if killed, is unhurt. On the other hand, if Hanuma has given up is life, we are all dead, even though living."""
Yuddha Kanda,74,19,"""O dear child! If Hanuma, who is equal to the wind and the fire in prowess, survives; then there is a hope for all of us to survive.'"
Yuddha Kanda,74,20,"Thereafter, Hanuma the son of wind-god approaching the elderly Jambavan, offered his salutation, by grasping the feet of Jambavan with modesty."
Yuddha Kanda,74,21,"Hearing the voice of Hanuma, Jambavan, the foremost among monkeys, with perturbed senses, considered himself as though born again."
Yuddha Kanda,74,22,"Thereafter, that Jambavan of great splendour spoke to Hanuma as follows: ""Come on, O foremost of monkeys! You ought to protect the lives of monkeys."""
Yuddha Kanda,74,23,"""You are the great companion for these monkeys, by your copious prowess. There is no other person. This is the appropriate time to show your prowess. I do not see any other person to do it."""
Yuddha Kanda,74,24,"""Cheer up the martial warriors of both monkeys and bears. Heal Rama and Lakshmana from their arrow-wounds."""
Yuddha Kanda,74,25,"""O Hanuma! You ought to go to Himalaya, the foremost of mountains, by traveling higher and higher over the large ocean."""
Yuddha Kanda,74,26,"""O annihilator of enemies! Thereafter, you will see there the Mount Rishabha, the excellent mountain and the very much powerful peak of Kailasa, with a golden hue."""
Yuddha Kanda,74,27,"""O valiant Hanuma! In the midst of these two peaks, you will see a blazing and unequally brilliant herbal mountain, containing all kinds of herbs."""
Yuddha Kanda,74,28,"""O foremost of monkeys! Sprouted on the head of that mountain, are four blazing herbs. You can see them, illuminating the ten quarters."""
Yuddha Kanda,74,29,"""You can see there, Mrita Sanjivani (capable of restoring the dead to life), Vishalyakarani (capable of extracting weapons and healing all wounds inflicted by weapons), Suvarnakarani (restoring the body to its original complexion) and Sandhani, the great herb (capable of joining severed limbs or fractured bone)."""
Yuddha Kanda,74,30,"""O Hanuma! Bring all those herbs quickly. O son of wind-god! Bring succour to the monkeys, by injecting lives into them."""
Yuddha Kanda,74,31,"Hearing the words of Jambavan, Hanuma the son of wind-god was infused with animated strength, as the ocean gets animated with the force of the wind."
Yuddha Kanda,74,32,"Standing on the summit of Trikuta mountain and pressing the foremost of mountains (with his feet), that valiant Hanuma appeared like a second mountain."
Yuddha Kanda,74,33,"Then, increasingly pressed and bent by Hanuma's feet, that mountain was not able to bear its weight and sank."
Yuddha Kanda,74,34,"The trees on that mountain, pressed by Hanuma, fell to the ground and caught fire due to rapidity of Hanuma. Its peaks also got broken."
Yuddha Kanda,74,35,"The monkeys were unable to stand on that excellent mountain, which started to reel, while being pressed severely by Hanuma, as the trees standing on it and the rocks got broken."
Yuddha Kanda,74,36,"Confounded with panic, the City of Lanka, whose principal gates were broken, whose houses and town-gates were shattered, appeared as though dancing at night."
Yuddha Kanda,74,37,"Pressing hard the mountain, Hanuma equal to a mountain, caused the earth along with the ocean to shake."
Yuddha Kanda,74,38,"From that mountain, Hanuma then ascended Mount Malaya, appearing as Mounts Meru and Mandara, filled with several kinds of cascades, full of many trees and creepers, having Kamala and Utpala lotuses blooming, visited by celestials and celestial musicians, having a height of sixty Yojanas (four hundred eighty miles), frequented by Vidyodharas, a number of sages and Apsaras the nymphs, filled with various kinds of animal-troupes and illuminated by many caves, Hanuma grew his body, appearing like a cloud, bewildering Yakshas, Gandharvas and Kinnaras."
Yuddha Kanda,74,39,"Pressing the mountain hard with his feet, opening his terrific mouth which shone like a submarine fire and frightening the demons, Hanuma roared loudly."
Yuddha Kanda,74,40,"Hearing his loud noise, roaring clamorously, the foremost of demons residing in the City of Lanka, were not able to stir anywhere."
Yuddha Kanda,74,41,"Hanuma of terrific prowess, annihilator of his enemies, after offering salutation to the ocean, made up his mind to embark on a prime act for the sake of Rama."
Yuddha Kanda,74,42,"Raising his tail which resembled on serpent, bending his back, contracting his ears and opening his month which shone like a terrific submarines-fire, Hanuma jumped into the sky, with a head long speed."
Yuddha Kanda,74,43,"By his velocity, he carried away a multitude of trees, mountains and some ordinary monkeys. Driven up and away by the momentum generated from his arms and thighs, they fell down in water when their speed diminished."
Yuddha Kanda,74,44,"Stretching his arms, looking like coils of serpents, that Hanuma vying with the prowess of hostile Garuda the eagle, headed towards the excellent mountain of Himalayas, with gush as though he was drawing away the four quarters."
Yuddha Kanda,74,45,"Beholding the sea, whose waves along with its water were made to agitate and all whose creatures were caused to whirl round, Hanuma quickly speeded up, like the discuss loosed by the fingers of Lord Vishnu."
Yuddha Kanda,74,46,"Gazing at the hills, flocks of birds, lakes, rivers, pools and excellent towns full of people, that Hanuma with a speed equal to that of the wind-god his father, shot forth towards Himalayas."
Yuddha Kanda,74,47,"That valiant Hanuma, with a prowess equal to that of his father, whose fatigue was gone, swiftly rushed, taking recourse to the orbit of the sun."
Yuddha Kanda,74,48,"With a great speed of wind, reverberating the four quarters with sound, Hanuma the foremost of monkeys, hastened towards Himalayas."
Yuddha Kanda,74,49,"Remembering the words of Jambavan, Hanuma the great monkey with a terrific stride, suddenly saw Mount Himalaya too."
Yuddha Kanda,74,50,"Hanuma went to Mount Himalaya, the foremost of mountains, embellished with various kinds of cascades, many kinds of caves, mountain-streams and summits resembling an assemblage of white clouds as also many kinds of trees."
Yuddha Kanda,74,51,"Having approached that great mountain having excellent overbearing summits, he saw great holy hermitages, inhabited by a multitude of divine sages."
Yuddha Kanda,74,52,"He saw the abode of Brahma the lord of creation, Kailasa the abode of Shiva the lord of dissolution, the abode of Indra the lord of celestials, the arrow-discharging place of Rudra, the worshipping place of Hayagriva, the horse-faced form of Vishnu, the shining place at which Brahma's head fell down, the sun-god and Kimkaras."
Yuddha Kanda,74,53,"He saw the abode of Agni the fire-god, the abode of Kubera (son of Visrava) shining like the sun, the spot where the sun was tied down, the abode of Brahma, the abode of bow belonging to Lord Shiva and the novel of the earth (containing the hole through which one can enter Patala the nethermost subterranean region)."
Yuddha Kanda,74,54,"He saw the gigantic Mount Kailasa, the rock of Mount Himalaya (on which Lord Shiva is believed to have practiced austerities and abstract meditation) and Mount Rishabha, the lofty golden mountain, which was highly illumined by the flaming herbs and the lord of mountains on which all types of herbs grew."
Yuddha Kanda,74,55,"Seeing that mountain shining with a heap of fire, Hanuma the son of wind-god, who is the envoy of Indra, was surprised to see that great mountain of herbs and then made a search for the herbs."
Yuddha Kanda,74,56,"That Hanuma, the great monkey, having crossed thousands of yojanas, walked around that mountain, searching for the heavenly herbs."
Yuddha Kanda,74,57,"Knowing then that somebody was coming in search of them, all the distinguished herbs on that mountain disappeared from Hanuma's view."
Yuddha Kanda,74,58,"In not seeing them thus, that great souled Hanuma was enraged. He made a loud noise in anger unable to bear it, Hanuma with his eyes as red as the fire, spoke the following words to the prince of mountains."
Yuddha Kanda,74,59,"""O prince of mountains! Is it quite sure that you have not shown any compassion for Rama? If it is so, overcome by the strength of my arms; find yourself shattered to pieces today."""
Yuddha Kanda,74,60,"Fiercely seizing hold of the top of that mountain, furnished with thousands of minerals, with its trees, elephants and gold, with the projections of mountain shattered and the crest of its plateau set on fire, at once sprang up with speed."
Yuddha Kanda,74,61,"Having uprooted that mountain, frightening the worlds together with the leaders of celestials and demons inhabiting them and being praised by many aerial beings, Hanuma sprang up into the sky and proceeded expeditiously with the terrible speed of Garuda the eagle."
Yuddha Kanda,74,62,"Grasping that mountain-peak, radiant as the sun, that Hanuma who resembled the sun, having reached the orbit of the sun, shone as a second sun (as sun's image) in the vicinity of the sun."
Yuddha Kanda,74,63,"In the sky, with that mountain in his hand, that Hanuma the offspring of the wind-god, who resembled a mountain himself, appeared mostly like Vishnu with his flaming discuss with its thousand edges holding his hand."
Yuddha Kanda,74,64,"Then, seeing Hanuma, the monkeys made a noise. Seeing them, Hanuma in turn roared in delight. Hearing their awfully excessive noises the inhabitants of Lanka roared still more terribly."
Yuddha Kanda,74,65,"Thereupon, the great souled Hanuma descended on that prince of mountains (Trikuta) in the midst of that army of monkeys. Having offered salutation to the illustrious monkeys there with his head bent low, he then embraced Vibhishana"
Yuddha Kanda,74,66,"By inhaling that fragrance of those great herbs, both Rama and Lakshamana became healed of their wounds then and there. Other monkey-warriors rose up."
Yuddha Kanda,74,67,"By the fragrance of those most powerful herbs, all those monkey-warriors who were earlier dead were healed momentarily of their wounds, relieved of their pain, even as those who are asleep fully get up at the close of night."
Yuddha Kanda,74,68,"From the day the monkeys and demons began to fight in Lanka, from that day onwards, under the orders of Ravana, all those demons, who were being killed by the foremost of monkeys were being thrown away into the sea as and when they were killed, merely or the sake of honour (so that their number may not be known to the monkeys)."
Yuddha Kanda,74,69,"Then, Hanuma the son of wind-god, with a great speed, carried away that mountain of herbs quickly back to the mountains of Himalayas and again joined Rama."
Yuddha Kanda,75,1,"Then, Sugreeva of great majesty, the king of monkeys spoke (the following) meaningful words to Hanuma, in order to inform him what they should do next."
Yuddha Kanda,75,2,"""Since Kumbhakarna and his four sons were killed, Ravana cannot give any defense now""."
Yuddha Kanda,75,3,"""Let those dexterous monkeys, possessing the strength of lions, taking torches in their hands, rush towards Lanka quickly, in order to set ablaze the abode of Ravana."""
Yuddha Kanda,75,4,"Then at the sunset of that awful evening, those foremost of the monkeys, went towards Lanka, with torches in their hands."
Yuddha Kanda,75,5,"When the troops of monkeys, with torches in their hands, attacked Lanka on all sides, the diversely eyed demons who were holding the position of guards, suddenly fled away."
Yuddha Kanda,75,6,"Those monkeys, feeling gladdened, threw fire to the towering gates, attics, streets, various byways and mansions."
Yuddha Kanda,75,7,"Then, the fire consumed thousands of houses of demons. Mansions of mountainous forms fell down on the ground."
Yuddha Kanda,75,8,"Aloe, excellent sandalwood of great value, pearls, glossy gems, diamonds and corals were burnt there."
Yuddha Kanda,75,9,"Linen, charming silk, blankets of sheep's wool, various kinds of ram's wool, gold ornaments and weapons were burnt there."
Yuddha Kanda,75,10,"The ornaments, saddles etc. of diverse and peculiar designs of horses, the chains worn round the neck of the elephants as also their girths and polished ornaments meant for the chariots were also burnt."
Yuddha Kanda,75,11,"Coats of mail of the warriors, the armour of the elephants and horses, swords, bows, bow-strings, arrows, lances, goads and javelins were burnt there."
Yuddha Kanda,75,12,"The fire raging on all sides burnt blankets and rugs made of the hair of animals, whisks made of the hair of the tails, the skins of tigers, many birds, palaces inlaid with pearls and gems and various kinds of stores of arms."
Yuddha Kanda,75,13,"Then, the fire burnt away many kinds of bright coloured houses of all demons, who were greedily desirous of their homes. The fire there burnt away hundreds and thousands of inhabitants of Lanka, who were protected by gold coloured armoury and decked with garlands, ornaments and garments, with quivering eyes due to inebriation, moving with lustful walking, who were seized with fury against their enemy, who carried maces, pikes and swords in their hands, who were eating and drinking too or lay fast asleep on splendid beds with their loved ones and who were decamping quickly to all sides, taking their sons with them, frightened and fearing up again and again."
Yuddha Kanda,75,14,"The fire there burnt away the houses, which were strong, very valuable, with profound qualities, decked in gold with moon shapes and crescent shapes, which rose high with their top rooms, provided all round with beautiful windows, furnished with seats coaches etc., decorated with gems and corals, as though touching the sky, rendered noisy with notes of herons, peacocks, veena the Indian lute and the jingling of ornaments as also appearing like mountains."
Yuddha Kanda,75,15,"Surrounded by fire, the arch-ways shone like a collection of clouds bound by lightning, at the end of a summer season."
Yuddha Kanda,75,16,"The houses, surrounded by fire shone like the peaks of a large mountain, ignited by a forest-fire."
Yuddha Kanda,75,17,"Getting scorched in fire, beautiful women, while lying fast asleep in their seven-storeyed mansions, gave up all connection with their ornaments and screamed loudly, saying ""ah! Alas!"""
Yuddha Kanda,75,18,"The houses too, surrounded by fire there, fell down like peaks of a great mountain, struck by the thunder-bolt of Indra."
Yuddha Kanda,75,19,"Those houses, while being burnt, shone, from afar, like the peaks of Himalayas being consumed by fire on all sides."
Yuddha Kanda,75,20,"That City of Lanka at night with its house-tops being burnt ablaze with flames, looked like Kimshuka trees in full bloom."
Yuddha Kanda,75,21,"With their elephants let loose by the superintendents of the elephants and horses too set free, Lanka was like an ocean, with roaming alligators in it at the end of a world-cycle."
Yuddha Kanda,75,22,"Here, seeing a horse being let loose, an elephant went back frightened. There, seeing a frightened elephant, a horse turned back with an alarm."
Yuddha Kanda,75,23,"While Lanka was being burnt, the great ocean, with its image reflected on its waters, assumed like a great sea with red waters."
Yuddha Kanda,75,24,"That City burnt by the monkeys, within a short time, became transformed like the earth burning at the time of terrific dissolution of this world."
Yuddha Kanda,75,25,"The noise of the women-folk, who were burnt by fire and covered with smoke, roaring loudly, was heard upto one hundred Yojanas (or eight hundred miles)."
Yuddha Kanda,75,26,"Then the monkeys, eager to fight, bounced suddenly upon the other demons, whose bodies had been severely burnt and who rushed out (to save their lives)."
Yuddha Kanda,75,27,"The loud noise made by the monkeys and the cry of the demons caused resounding of all the ten quarters, the ocean and the earth."
Yuddha Kanda,75,28,"Healed of their wounds and unperplexed, both those great souled princes, Rama and Lakshmana seized hold of those two excellent bows."
Yuddha Kanda,75,29,"Thereupon, Rama pulled his excellent bow, making a tumultuous twang, which struck terror in demons."
Yuddha Kanda,75,30,"Rama, drawing his great bow, was as shining at that time as Lord Shiva (the source of Universe), stretching his bow, consisting of the Vedas in a great wrath (as at the time of dissolution of the Universe)."
Yuddha Kanda,75,31,The twang of the bow-string of Rama could be heard above both of those sounds. The sound of the monkeys and the cry of the demons.
Yuddha Kanda,75,32,"The raised voice of the monkeys, the cry of the demons and even the twang of Rama's bow-string these three sounds pervaded all the ten quarters."
Yuddha Kanda,75,33,"By the arrows released from Rama's bow, the main gate of that City looking like a peak of Mount Kailasa, tumbled down, shattered, to the ground."
Yuddha Kanda,75,34,"Thereupon, seeing Rama's arrows descending on seven-storeyed mansions and other houses, the war-preparedness of the leaders of demons got disturbed."
Yuddha Kanda,75,35,"To those demoniac leaders, who were preparing for the battle and emitting lion's roars, that night became a night of final dissolution (presided over by Rudra, the lord of destruction)."
Yuddha Kanda,75,36,"The monkey-chiefs were commanded by Sugreeva as follows: ""O monkeys! Approaching the nearest gate, begin to wage the war. Even though present at the scene of fighting, he among you who proves futile by an escape, should be overtaken and killed as he will be quality of disobeying the royal command."""
Yuddha Kanda,75,37,"Seeing those monkey-chiefs, standing at the gate, with flaming torches in their hands, Ravana was enraged with fury."
Yuddha Kanda,75,38,All the ten directions were distracted because of Ravana's act of disorderly movement of his body due to yawning and he looked like the wrath manifest in the limbs of Rudra appearing with a form.
Yuddha Kanda,75,39,"The enraged Ravana sent both Kumbha and Nimkumbha, the sons of Kumbhakarna, along with a multitude of demons."
Yuddha Kanda,75,40,"By the orders of Ravana, Yupaksha, Shonitaksha, Prajangha and Kampana along with the aforesaid sons of Kumbhakarna set out for the battle."
Yuddha Kanda,75,41,"Ravana instructed all those mighty demons thus, ""O demons! Proceed now itself, bellowing a lion's roar."""
Yuddha Kanda,75,42,"Incited by Ravana, the valiant demons then, wielding shining weapons and roaring repeatedly, sallied forth from Lanka."
Yuddha Kanda,75,43,"By the gleams of ornaments worn by their own natural splendour, those demons and monkeys with their fires, made the sky fluorescent on all sides."
Yuddha Kanda,75,44,"The effulgence of the moon there, the light of the stars and the splendour of the ornaments of both the armies, while blazing, made the sky brilliant."
Yuddha Kanda,75,45,"The effulgence of the moon, the splendour of the ornaments and the fluorescence of the blazing planets made the armies of monkeys and demons glitter on all sides."
Yuddha Kanda,75,46,"With the flames of the half-scorched houses there, the ocean on its part with its agitated waves mingled with water, shone abundantly."
Yuddha Kanda,75,47,"That army of demons was looking awful with flags and banners, with excellent axes shaped like swords, consisting of terrific horses, chariots and elephants, crowded with foot-soldiers of every description, distinguished by shining pikes, maces, swords, spears, lances and bows, noted for its redoubtable valour and prowess, with shining lances and rendered noisy by hundreds of tiny bells (tied around chariots, elephants etc), the arms of its warriors adorned with sets of gold ornaments, their axes being brandished, mighty weapons being waved about, arrows fitted to the bows and the whole atmosphere rendered fragrant by the abundance of sandal paste, garlands and wine."
Yuddha Kanda,75,48,"Seeing the army of demons, which came crowded with gallant warriors, thundered like a huge cloud which was difficult to assail, the army of monkeys marched forth and made a loud noise."
Yuddha Kanda,75,49,"That large army of demons on its part went springing forward with all speed, towards the hostile army, as moths towards a flame."
Yuddha Kanda,75,50,"The excellent army of those demons, in which iron clubs and the tips of missiles being brandished through the action of their arms, shone all the more brightly."
Yuddha Kanda,75,51,"Thereafter, the monkeys desirous to fight there, striking the demons with trees, rocks and fists, jumped up as though frenzied."
Yuddha Kanda,75,52,"Likewise, the demons with their terrific prowess instantly tore off the heads of those monkeys bouncing upon them, with sharp arrows."
Yuddha Kanda,75,53,"The demons there strolled in the streets of Lanka, with their ears bitten off with teeth, their skulls smashed with fists and their limbs broken by crag blows."
Yuddha Kanda,75,54,"Even so, some demons with terrific form struck those chiefs among the monkeys, with sharp swords, on all sides of the battle field."
Yuddha Kanda,75,55,"One warrior killed the one who was killing another, a second one threw down the one throwing down another; a third one scolded another who was scolding the other one; while a fourth one chewed the one chewing another."
Yuddha Kanda,75,56,"There, one said ""Give me the blow. Another said, ""He is giving"". Yet another said, ""I am giving"" some talked with one another, saying ""Wait. Why do you take pains?"""
Yuddha Kanda,75,57,"In that very terrific war between monkeys and demons, some weapons were made futile. Some weapons were dug into armours. Long lances were lifted up. Fists, pikes, swords and spears were used as weapons of war."
Yuddha Kanda,75,58,"In the battle-front, the demons killed monkeys in tens and sevens. The monkeys too threw the demons down in tens and sevens."
Yuddha Kanda,75,59,"Catching hold of the army of demons, whose hair and raiment's were kept in order with difficulty and whose armours and standards were thrown away, the monkeys surrounded them on all sides."
Yuddha Kanda,76,1,"While that terrific battle, which destroyed many eminent heroes, was in progress, Angada, who was eager to fight, attacked the valiant Kampana."
Yuddha Kanda,76,2,"Calling Angada to fight, Kampana with fury, rapidly struck him with a mace in anticipation. Violently hit by him, Angada was reeled."
Yuddha Kanda,76,3,"Restoring consciousness, the energetic Angada hurled a mountain peak. Tormented by that stroke, Kampana fell down on the ground."
Yuddha Kanda,76,4,"Then, seeing Kampana killed in battle, Shonitaksha fearlessly rushed there towards Angada quickly in a chariot."
Yuddha Kanda,76,5,"He then swiftly struck Angada with sharp pointed arrows which can tear up the limbs and with fire-like forms which can destroy the world. He struck with many sharp arrows by the names of Kshura, Kshurapra, Naaraacha, Vatsatanta, Shilimukha, Karni, Shalya and Vipatha."
Yuddha Kanda,76,6,"The strong and powerful Angada, the son of Vali, with his wounded limbs, crushed his terrific bow, chariot and darts with his might."
Yuddha Kanda,76,7,"Then, Shonitaksha quickly took a sword and a shield. Enraged as he was, he swiftly jumped down (from his chariot) unhesitatingly."
Yuddha Kanda,76,8,"Springing forward more swiftly, seizing hold of him with his hand and snatching away the sword, the strong Angada made a lion's roar."
Yuddha Kanda,76,9,Angada the foremost of monkeys the sword into the flat surface of his shoulder and cut him from left to right diagonally.
Yuddha Kanda,76,10,"Taking hold of that large sword and repeatedly roaring, Angada rushed towards the other surviving enemies in the battle-front."
Yuddha Kanda,76,11,"Taking hold of that large sword and repeatedly roaring, Angada rushed towards the other surviving enemies in the battle-front."
Yuddha Kanda,76,12,"That valiant Shonitaksha, wearing golden armlets, restoring his consciousness, took an iron mace and rushed quickly towards the same Angada."
Yuddha Kanda,76,13,"The strong and the great warrior, Prajangha on his part, along with Yupaksha, was enraged and rushed towards the mighty Angada with his mace."
Yuddha Kanda,76,14,"Angada, the chief of monkeys, between the two warriors, Shonitaksha and Prajangha, shone like a full moon between the two asterisms known as Vishakhas."
Yuddha Kanda,76,15,"Protecting Angada, Mainda and Dvivida took their position near Angada, with an intent to exhibit each of their own martial skill."
Yuddha Kanda,76,16,"The mighty demons with their colossal bodies retaliated and rushed in anger, wielding swords, arrows and maces, towards the monkeys."
Yuddha Kanda,76,17,"A great battle, causing hair to stand on end, was waged by the three monkey-chiefs who encountered the three excellent demons."
Yuddha Kanda,76,18,"In the battle-field, the monkeys, seizing hold of trees, hurled them against the demon-chiefs. The mighty Prajangha, however, cut them down with his sword."
Yuddha Kanda,76,19,The monkeys in the battle-field hurled trees and rocks towards chariots and horses. The mighty Yupaksha chopped them off with a flood of arrows.
Yuddha Kanda,76,20,"Shonitaksha, the valiant and the powerful demon, chopped off the trees uplifted and hurled by Dvivida and Mainda with his mace in the midway itself."
Yuddha Kanda,76,21,"Prajangha, lifting a large sword, which can chop off vital parts of the enemies, rushed swiftly towards Angada."
Yuddha Kanda,76,22,"Then the mighty Angada, who was exceedingly strong, seeing him coming nearer, struck him with an Ashvakarna tree."
Yuddha Kanda,76,23,"Angada struck, with his fist, the arm of Prajangha, holding the sword. By that blow, the sword fell on the ground."
Yuddha Kanda,76,24,"Seeing that sword looking like a pebble (in shape), which fell on the ground, the mighty Prajangha tightened his thunderbolt like fist."
Yuddha Kanda,76,25,"When that Prajangha of great splendour struck Angaa, the excellent monkey with a great strength on his forehead, Angada shuddered for a moment."
Yuddha Kanda,76,26,"That Angada of splendour and prowess, restoring his consciousness, struck with his fist and shattered Prajangha's head off his trunk."
Yuddha Kanda,76,27,"That Yupaksha, with tears filled in his eyes because of the death of his paternal uncle in battle, quickly took a sword as his arrows were exhausted and descended from his chariot."
Yuddha Kanda,76,28,"Seeing that Yupaksha rushing on him, Dvivida hurriedly struck Yupaksha on his chest and with a rage, forcibly caught hold of him."
Yuddha Kanda,76,29,"Seeing his mighty brother being seized, Shonitaksha, of great splendour, then struck Dvivida on his chest."
Yuddha Kanda,76,30,"That mighty Dvivida, struck by Shonitaksha was tottered; but pulled off the platter's mace when lifted again on him."
Yuddha Kanda,76,31,"Meanwhile, Mainda came nearer to Dvivida and banged Yupaksha on his chest with his palm."
Yuddha Kanda,76,32,"Those two demons, Shonitaksha and Yupaksha, who were full of violence, carried on a keen contest with the two monkeys in the battle field, by pulling and overthrowing them vehemently and severely."
Yuddha Kanda,76,33,"The valiant Dvivida, after splitting open shonitaksha's face with his claws, threw him down on the floor by his strength and crushed him down."
Yuddha Kanda,76,34,"Mainda, the foremost of monkeys, was enraged and pressed Yupaksha with his arms. Yupaksha fell down dead on the ground."
Yuddha Kanda,76,35,"That army of demons, which was perturbed with their great warriors killed, then moved with its face turned towards the place where Kumbha (the son of Kumbhakarna) was carrying on battle."
Yuddha Kanda,76,36,"Kumbha, restored to confidence, that army which was coming towards him with speed. Then, seeing the army of demons whose chief-warriors were thrown down by the most powerful monkeys who could fulfill their aim, the powerful Kumbha then performed a great feat which was very difficult to do in a battle."
Yuddha Kanda,76,37,"That Kumbha, the foremost among the wielders of bow, taking his bow and fully composed, released serpentine arrows which can split open the bodies."
Yuddha Kanda,76,38,"That excellent bow of his, fitted with an arrow, shone like a second bow of Indra (the rain-god), illumined by flashes of lightning and the splendour of Airavata (the elephant carrying Indra on its back)."
Yuddha Kanda,76,39,"By that arrow with a golden shaft and fastened with feathers, drawn upto his ear and discharged, he then struck Dvivida."
Yuddha Kanda,76,40,"Suddenly struck by that arrow, that excellent monkey possessing a splendour of Mount Trikuta, was perturbed, with his feet swaying to and fro and fell down throbbing."
Yuddha Kanda,76,41,"Beholding his brother defeated in that great battle, Mainda there on his part, taking a large rock, rushed with speed to attack the demon."
Yuddha Kanda,76,42,"While that mighty Mainda hurled that rock towards the demon, Kumbha broke that rock into pieces with his five shining arrows."
Yuddha Kanda,76,43,"Stretching another arrow resembling a serpent and with a good pointed tip, Kumbha of a great splendour, struck it on the chest of Mainda the brother of Dvivida."
Yuddha Kanda,76,44,"As that blow of Kumbha's arrow struck that Mainda, the monkey-chief, on his vital parts, he fell unconscious on the ground."
Yuddha Kanda,76,45,"Seeing both his mighty maternal uncles wounded, Angada rushed speedily towards Kumbha, who was standing with his bow uplifted."
Yuddha Kanda,76,46,"With five steel arrows and with three other sharp-edged arrows, Kumbha pierced that Angada advancing towards him, as on would pierce an elephant with goads."
Yuddha Kanda,76,47,"That valiant Kumbha pierced Angada with a multiple of sharp arrows, decked in gold, with edges which were harsh and sharp."
Yuddha Kanda,76,48,"Angada, the son of wind-god, though pierced all over the body with sharp arrows, was however not shaken. He showered a rain of rocks and trees on Kumbha's head."
Yuddha Kanda,76,49,The glorious Kumbha the son of Kumbhakarna chopped off all those trees hurled by Angada and burst off the rocks further.
Yuddha Kanda,76,50,"Seeing Angada the monkey-chief rushing upon him, Kumbha pierced his brows with his brows with his arrows, as an elephant would be struck with flaming torches."
Yuddha Kanda,76,51,"Since Angada's blood was oozing out, his eyes were covered with blood; Covering his eyes, dampened with blood, with one hand, he caught hold of a Sala tree nearby with another hand."
Yuddha Kanda,76,52,"In the battle-field, propping that tree with branches and all, on his chest, holding it with his hand and bending a little, Angada uprooted it from the ground."
Yuddha Kanda,76,53,"While all the demons were looking on, Angada hurled that tree-which was tall like Indra's banner and resembled Mount Mandara in size."
Yuddha Kanda,76,54,"That Kumbha chopped off that tree with seven sharp arrows which were capable of splitting asunder the body. That Angada was very much perturbed and fell down, swooning."
Yuddha Kanda,76,55,"Seeing the unconquerable Angada fallen down and sinking into depression as though in an ocean, the monkey-chiefs informed the matter to Rama."
Yuddha Kanda,76,56,"Hearing of Angada being seized with anguish in that great combat, Rama sent out for help, leaders of monkeys, headed by Jambavan."
Yuddha Kanda,76,57,"Hearing Rama's message, those excellent monkeys were very much enraged and quickly rushed towards Kumbha who was wielding a bow in his hand."
Yuddha Kanda,76,58,"With an intent to defend Angada, the monkey-chiefs then holding trees and rocks in their hands and with their furious blood-red eyes, rushed on."
Yuddha Kanda,76,59,"The enraged Jambavan, Sushena and Vegadarshi, the monkey ran up towards Kumbha the son of Kumbhakarna to attack him."
Yuddha Kanda,76,60,"Seeing those mighty monkey-chiefs coming nearer to him, Kumbha covered them with a flood of arrows, as one would obstruct the course of a stream by means of a rock."
Yuddha Kanda,76,61,"Reaching the range of his arrows, the great souled monkey-chiefs were unable even to look at him, much less advance towards him, any more than a great ocean would overstep its shore."
Yuddha Kanda,76,62,"Seeing those troops of monkeys being tormented by a flood of arrows, Sugreeva the king of monkeys, keeping Angada his brother's son in the rear, rushed headlong towards Kumbha in the battle, as a swift lion would bounce upon an elephant walking along the slopes of a mountain."
Yuddha Kanda,76,63,"Uprooting many large trees beginning with Ashvakarna and many kinds of trees, Sugreeva the king of monkeys hurled them on Kumbha."
Yuddha Kanda,76,64,"The illustrious Kumbha, the son of Kumbhakarna, with his sharp arrows, chopped off that down pour of trees, which was obscuring the sky and which was difficult to be assailed."
Yuddha Kanda,76,65,"The trees, chopped off with his sharp arrows by the brutal Kumbha, skilled in hitting his target, shone like terrific Shataghnis (stones or cylindrical pieces of wood studded with iron spikes)."
Yuddha Kanda,76,66,"Seeing that shower of trees chopped off by Kumbha, the mighty and illustrious Sugreeva of valour was not disturbed."
Yuddha Kanda,76,67,"Enduring those arrows being hit, Sugreeva snatched away Kumbha's bow, possessing the splendour of a rain-bow and broke it all at once."
Yuddha Kanda,76,68,"Thus bouncing swiftly and doing that most difficult task, the enraged Sugreeva spoke (as follows) to Kumbha, who was looking like an elephant with a broken tusk."
Yuddha Kanda,76,69,"""O Kumbha, the elder brother of Nikumbha! Both your prowess and the swiftness of your arrow are wonderful. Both Ravana and you are equal in complaisance towards demons and the majesty too exists."
Yuddha Kanda,76,70,"""O Kumbha, the compeer of Prahlada, Bali, Indra (the destroyer of the demon Vritra), Kubera (the god of riches) and Varuna (the god of water)! You alone are born with a likeness of your father (Kumbhakarna) who was exceedingly strong."""
Yuddha Kanda,76,71,"""The celestials cannot surpass even you alone, with a spike in hand, who can destroy the enemy with your large arms, as mental agonies cannot overwhelm the one who subdued his senses. Hence, exhibit your prowess, O demon of great intellect and see my exploits."""
Yuddha Kanda,76,72,"""Because of the boon received by him, Ravana your uncle is able to attack the celestials and demons. But Kumbhakarna (your father) on his part is tolerating the celestials and demons."""
Yuddha Kanda,76,73,"""You are equal in archery to Indrajit and in prowess to Ravana. Hence, you are now the foremost in strength and heroism among the demon-folk."""
Yuddha Kanda,76,74,"""Let the created beings see your great wonderful fight with me in the battle field today, as they saw that fight between Indra and Shambara, the demon."""
Yuddha Kanda,76,75,"""You have performed an incomparable task. You have also shown your skill in missile weaponry. You have struck down these monkey-heroes possessing a terrific prowess."""
Yuddha Kanda,76,76,"""O valiant demon! Since you look tired after performing your martial duty, I did not kill you, with a fear of public censure. Identify my strength, after taking some rest."""
Yuddha Kanda,76,77,"Kumbha was thus honoured with those insulting words of Sugreeva. Kumbha's splendour then enhanced, like the splendour of the sacrificial fire, when a melted butter is offered to it as an oblation."""
Yuddha Kanda,76,78,"The reopen, Kumbha pressingly clasped Sugreeva in his arms. Then, they stood breathing heavily again and again as elephants in rut, having their bodies fastened against each other, rubbing one another and emitting a flame to blaze with smoke from their faces because of their fatigue."
Yuddha Kanda,76,79,"The battle-ground sank under the trampling of their feet. With their waves whirled about, the ocean became turbulent."
Yuddha Kanda,76,80,"Then tossing up Kumbha, Sugreeva threw him down speedily into the ocean, showing him the bottom of the sea."
Yuddha Kanda,76,81,"Due to the hurling down of Kumbha, the fully risen sea, reaching a height of as to that of Mount Vindhya, diffused on all sides."
Yuddha Kanda,76,82,"The enraged Kumbha, then jumping up and throwing down Sugreeva, struck him on his chest with his thunderbolt-like fist."
Yuddha Kanda,76,83,Sugreeva's armour was burst asunder. Even blood appeared oozing out of his chest. His cage of bones gave a counter-strike to that awfully forceful fist.
Yuddha Kanda,76,84,"Then, by the force of that fist shot forth there, a mighty flame resembling the fire that bursts up on Mount Meru, was born out of a stroke of lightning."
Yuddha Kanda,76,85,"Thus struck by Kumbha there, that mighty Sugreeva, the chief of monkeys, tightened his fist which appeared like a thunderbolt."
Yuddha Kanda,76,86,"The valiant Sugreeva forcefully descended his fist, which shone like the solar disc encircled by a thousand rays, on the breast of Kumbha."
Yuddha Kanda,76,87,"That Kumbha, very much hurt by that blow, was exhausted and then fell down, like fire whose flame has extinguished."
Yuddha Kanda,76,88,"Thus struck with Sugreeva's fist, that demon fell down suddenly, as the planet Mars, of splendid rays, would drop down from the sky accidentally."
Yuddha Kanda,76,89,"When Kumbha was killed in battle by Sugreeva the chief of monkeys, possessing a terrific prowess, the earth with its mountains and forests trembled. Too much fear seized the demons."
Yuddha Kanda,77,1,"Seeing his brother stretched on the ground, Nikumbha cast angry looks at Sugreeva, as it would burn him into ashes."
Yuddha Kanda,77,2,"Then, Nikumbha of firm mind grasped his iron club, stupendous like the crest of Mount Mandara and which was bright, festooned with wreaths and provided with iron plates, measuring five digits in breadth."
Yuddha Kanda,77,3,"Round it ran a broad strip of gold while diamonds and rubies studded it all over. Like the death-dealing rod of Yama, it seemed causing dismay to the monkeys and nerving the demons with courage."
Yuddha Kanda,77,4,"Wielding that weapon, which in size resembled the flag-staff of Indra, Nikumbha of terrific prowess, roared with his mouth yawing wide."
Yuddha Kanda,77,5,"On his chest shone a medal of gold. His arms were held by beautiful bracelets. Lustrous pendants depended from his ear. Resplendent garland enfolded his neck. With these ornaments and with his club, Nikumbha assumed the threatening semblance of a cloud, with lightning and thunder and shot with a vivid rainbow."
Yuddha Kanda,77,6,"The strong Nikumbha, with his arms as strong as his club, hurled his club having sun-like splendour, on the breast of that mighty Hanuma."
Yuddha Kanda,77,7,"The sky above appeared whirled around in the toss of Nikumbha's club, as though Alaka the City with the palaces of Gandharvas performed rapid revolutions and the moon and the stars and the planets joining the rotating race."
Yuddha Kanda,77,8,"The hot tempered fire of Nikumbha, which had his club and ornaments for its flame and his fury as its fuel, became dangerous to be approached, like the fire rising at the time of dissolution of the world."
Yuddha Kanda,77,9,"The demons and the monkeys too, out of fear, were unable even to make the slightest movement. The mighty Hanuma, on his part, stood alone among them, with his breast bared to the fury of the attack, in front of Nikumbha."
Yuddha Kanda,77,10,"The strong Nikumbha, with his arms as strong as his club, hurled his club having sun-like splendour, on the breast of that mighty Hanuma."
Yuddha Kanda,77,11,"The titanic club, which fell on the wide and rock-like chest of Hanuma, at once shattered into hundreds of fragments, like hundreds of meteors shattering into the sky."
Yuddha Kanda,77,12,"That Hanuma, struck by that blow of the club, was unmoved like a mountain in an earthquake."
Yuddha Kanda,77,13,"Thus struck by him, the mighty Hanuma the monkey-chief clenched his fist forcibly."
Yuddha Kanda,77,14,"The greatly splendoured, powerful and swift Hanuma, with the violence of the wind-god, his father, lifting that fist, struck it against, Nikumbha's breast with force."
Yuddha Kanda,77,15,"By the blow of that fist there, his armour got split up and red blood profusely oozed out, as a black cloud streaked suddenly with fierce lightning."
Yuddha Kanda,77,16,"But, by that blow, Nikumbha was unmoved, recovered soon and grasped the unwieldy bulk of Hanuma."
Yuddha Kanda,77,17,"Seeing the mighty Hanuma lifted off the ground in battle, loud roar of exultant joy rose from the ranks of demons."
Yuddha Kanda,77,18,"Eventhough he was being carried off in that way by that demon, Hanuma the son of wind-god, struck him with his thunderbolt-like fist."
Yuddha Kanda,77,19,"Freeing himself from Nikumbha, Hanuma the son of wind-god then threw him down on the ground and treated him with blows."
Yuddha Kanda,77,20,"Throwing down Nikumbha by main force and with a supreme effort, Hanuma descended on him, leaped on his chest and pounded it mercilessly."
Yuddha Kanda,77,21,"Then with both hands, he caught the enemy's neck, twisted it about and tore off his huge head, while Nikumbha was horribly roaring."
Yuddha Kanda,77,22,"Then, while the roaring Nikumbha was killed in battle by Hanuma, there ensued an exceedingly terrific struggle between the enraged Rama and Makaraksha, son of Khara, a ruler of demons."
Yuddha Kanda,77,23,"When it was clear that Nikumbha had expired, the monkeys shouted with glee, the quarters thundered with satisfaction, the earth rocked with joy, the heaven appeared to crumble and fear seized the army of demons."
Yuddha Kanda,78,1,"On hearing of Nikumbha and Kumbha having been killed, Ravana was very much flared up like fire."
Yuddha Kanda,78,2,"Engulfed with both anger and sorrow, Ravana ordered the wide-eyed Makaraksha, the son of Khara (as follows):"
Yuddha Kanda,78,3,"""I am commanding you! Accompanied by an army, go my son! Kill Rama, Lakshmana and the monkeys."""
Yuddha Kanda,78,4,"Hearing Ravana's words, Makaraksha, the son of Khara, thinking himself as a hero, was rejoiced and assured Ravana that he would do it certainly as commanded."
Yuddha Kanda,78,5,"Having respectfully saluted, even by performing circumambulation, the mighty Makaraksha, by the orders of Ravana, came forth from these shining palace of Ravana."
Yuddha Kanda,78,6,Makaraksha the son of Khara asked the commander of an army who was in the vicinity to bring a chariot and the army swiftly.
Yuddha Kanda,78,7,"Hearing his words, the army-commander of the demons brought the chariot and the army to his proximity."
Yuddha Kanda,78,8,"Walking clockwise round the chariot and ascending it, Makaraksha asked the charioteer to drive forward the chariot quickly to the battle-field."
Yuddha Kanda,78,9,"Then Makaraksha spoke the following words to those demons, ""O demons! All of you begin your fight before my presence."""
Yuddha Kanda,78,10,"""The mighty Ravana, the king of demons commanded me to kill both Rama and Lakshmana in battle."""
Yuddha Kanda,78,11,"""Today, I will kill Rama, Lakshmana, Sugreeva the monkey and the other monkeys with my excellent arrows, O demons!"""
Yuddha Kanda,78,12,"""By hurling the spears, I will destroy completely the huge army of monkeys who arrived today to the battle-field, as the fire destroys the dry wood."""
Yuddha Kanda,78,13,"Hearing those words of Makaraksha, all those strong demons, wielding various kinds of weapons, were steadfast to fight."
Yuddha Kanda,78,14,"Those cruel demons, who can change their forms at will, who had protruding tusks, had tawny coloured eyes, had their disheveled hair, creating terror with their colossal bodies, then marched forward like roaring elephants, shaking the firmament and surrounded the huge-bodied Makaraksha."
Yuddha Kanda,78,15,"There arose a great tumult sounded, on all sides, of thousands of couches and kettle-drums including leonine roars and clapping of arms."
Yuddha Kanda,78,16,The long whip then slipped down from the hands of Makaraksha's charioteer and the flag-staff of that demon also suddenly fell down by the will of the province.
Yuddha Kanda,78,17,"Those horses, yoked to his chariot, deprived of their diversified gait, were walking with flurried feet and went timidly, with tears in their eyes."
Yuddha Kanda,78,18,"At the time of marching of that dreadful and evil-minded Makaraksha, a harsh and fearful dust-storm blew forth."
Yuddha Kanda,78,19,"Though seeing those portents, all those highly valiant demons ignored them and set out to the place, where both Rama and Lakshmana were there."
Yuddha Kanda,78,20,"Saying thunderously, ""I shall take the lead"", those demons who resembled black clouds, elephants and buffaloes in hue, who had been wounded pointedly more than once by maces and swords in the battle-front and who were skilled in martial art, moved hither and thither in the battle-field."
Yuddha Kanda,79,1,"On seeing Markaraksha come out, all those chiefs of monkeys, leaping all at once, took their positions, with intent to give fight."
Yuddha Kanda,79,2,"Thereafter, a very great battle ensued between monkeys and demons, which caused one's hair to bristle, like the encounter between celestials and demons."
Yuddha Kanda,79,3,"The monkeys and demons then, by hurling trees and spikes and by throwing maces and clubs, began to crush each other."
Yuddha Kanda,79,4,"Those demons, who were prowlers of might, made a slaughter of the lions among the monkeys, by means of their javelins, swords, maces, spears, lances, sharp edged spears, Bhindipalas (slings for throwing stones), nooses, mallets, staffs, missiles and other weapons and by throwing arrows on all sides."
Yuddha Kanda,79,5,"Tormented by Makaraksha with a multitude of arrows, all the monkeys were bewildered in mind, agonized with fear and ran away."
Yuddha Kanda,79,6,"On seeing those monkeys fleeing, all the arrogant demons roared like lions, assuming a triumphant feeling."
Yuddha Kanda,79,7,"While those monkeys were fleeing on all sides, Rama then, with a shower of arrows, intercepted those demons on that occasion."
Yuddha Kanda,79,8,"Seeing Rama thus interrupting the demons, Makaraksha, the demon, engrossed in a fire of anger, spoke the following words:"
Yuddha Kanda,79,9,"""Pause, O Rama! You will have a dual with me. I will make your life to quit, by the sharp arrows discharged from my bow."""
Yuddha Kanda,79,10,"""Since you killed my father on that day in Dandaka forest, my anger is still growing violent, when I think of you engaged in such nefarious acts""."
Yuddha Kanda,79,11,"""O evil minded Rama! Since you were not being seen by me from that time in that large forest, my limbs were getting very much fumed."""
Yuddha Kanda,79,12,"""By a good fortune, you came into my sight here, O Rama! You are being sought by me, as a lion in hunger seeks other animal to eat."""
Yuddha Kanda,79,13,"""Now, by the flight of my arrows, you will go to the world of Death and reside there with those warriors, who were killed by you earlier."""
Yuddha Kanda,79,14,"""O Rama! What is the use, by telling too much on this topic? Hear my words. All the worlds will look at you and me, in this battle-front."""
Yuddha Kanda,79,15,"""O Rama! The battle will proceed in the battle-field, either with the weapons, or with a mace or by our arms or by any other means as learnt by you."""
Yuddha Kanda,79,16,"Hearing the words of Makaraksha, Rama the son of Dasaratha laughingly spoke the following words to him, who was still talking further and further (without interruption)."
Yuddha Kanda,79,17,"""O demon! Why are you boasting yourself with so many unworthy words, in vain? Without fighting in the battle-field, it is well nigh impossible for you to attain victory with the strength of a mere speech."""
Yuddha Kanda,79,18,"""I killed fourteen thousand demons along with Khara your father, Trishira and even Dushana in Dandaka forest."""
Yuddha Kanda,79,19,"""O sinful one! Today, vultures jackals and crows with their sharp beaks and goad-like claws will be satiated with your flesh."""
Yuddha Kanda,79,20,"Hearing Rama's words, the mighty Makaraksha discharged a multitude of arrows on that Rama in the battle-field."
Yuddha Kanda,79,21,"Rama tore those arrows in many ways, by his array of arrows. Those arrows, which were provided with golden shafts, fell to the ground, when torn in thousands."
Yuddha Kanda,79,22,"That battle raged furiously, on their meeting each other there, between Makaraksha the son of Khara the demon and Rama the son of Dasaratha."
Yuddha Kanda,79,23,"Then, the sound emanated by the bows, with a great resonance, was heard on the battle-front, like the rumbling of clouds in space."
Yuddha Kanda,79,24,"With an intent to see that wonderful battle, all the celestials, the demons, the celestial musicians kinnaras the mythical beings and Mahoragas the great serpents reached the sky."
Yuddha Kanda,79,25,"Though the limbs of both were pierced by each other, their strength was redoubled. The two warriors inflicted wounds on each other, returned the blows of the other in the battle-front and continued the combat."
Yuddha Kanda,79,26,"In the battle, that demon broke the multitude of arrows discharged by Rama. Rama snapped off, in many ways, the arrows released by the demon."
Yuddha Kanda,79,27,All the four quarters and the intermediate points were diffused with a multitude of arrows. Even the earth was covered on all sides and did not become visible.
Yuddha Kanda,79,28,"Then, the long-armed Rama, full of anger in battle, broke off the bow of the demon. Thereupon, by his eight iron arrows, struck the charioteer."
Yuddha Kanda,79,29,"Rama, breaking the chariot with his arrows and killing its horses, made them to fall down dead. That Makaraksha the demon, bereft of his chariot, stood on the ground."
Yuddha Kanda,79,30,"That demon, standing on the ground, took into his hand, a spike, which created fright among all living beings and whose splendour was equal to the fire at the end of the world."
Yuddha Kanda,79,31,"That great spike, which was difficult to be obtained, was gifted to him by Rudra, one of the eight forms of Shiva the Lord of Dissolution. That terrible spike, which flamed violently in the sky, looked like another new weapon of destruction of the world. On seeing it, all the godheads were afflicted with fear and fled to different quarters."
Yuddha Kanda,79,32,"Brandishing that flaming great spike, that enraged demon hurled it against that great-souled rama."
Yuddha Kanda,79,33,"Rama broke, by his four arrows, that flaming spike coming forth from Makaraksha's arm and rushing towards him in the sky."
Yuddha Kanda,79,34,"That spike, adored with charming gold, broken in many ways, struck by Rama's arrows, fell scattered on the earth, like a mighty meteor."
Yuddha Kanda,79,35,"Seeing that spike struck by Rama, who was unwearied in action, the beings standing in the air, cried, saying 'Excellent, Excellent!'."
Yuddha Kanda,79,36,"Seeing that spike destroyed, Makaraksha the demon, rising his fist, called out to Rama, saying ""Wait, Wait!""."
Yuddha Kanda,79,37,"Then, seeing Makaraksha rushing towards him, that Rama the delight of Raghu dynasty, while smiling, fitted to his bow, a mystic missile presided over by fire."
Yuddha Kanda,79,38,"Struck by that missile by Rama, the demon with his heart split open, fell down dead then and there, in the battle-field."
Yuddha Kanda,79,39,"Seeing the fall of Makaraksha, all those demons, tormented by the fear of Rama's arrows, ran away straight to Lanka."
Yuddha Kanda,79,40,"Thrilled with delight, the celestials watched that demon, the son of Khara, destroyed by the flights of Rama's arrows and resembling a mountain shattered, after struck by lightning."
Yuddha Kanda,80,1,"On hearing Makaraksha having been killed, Ravana who had been ever victorious in battle, grinding his teeth in rage, reflected on what to do then and there, and as greatly furious as he was, instructed Indrajit, his son to proceed to the battle-field."
Yuddha Kanda,80,2,"""O hero! Either remaining yourself invisible or visible, kill Rama and Lakshmana, the brothers of great prowess. You are superior in strength by all means."""
Yuddha Kanda,80,3,"""You have conquered Indra, of incomparable deeds, in battle. Can you not kill those two men, on seeing them in the battle-field?"""
Yuddha Kanda,80,4,"Hearing the words of Ravana, that Indrajit, bowing to the command of his father, poured oblations into the sacred fire, with due ceremony, on the sacrificial ground."
Yuddha Kanda,80,5,"Even as he was pouring oblations into the sacred fire there, the female-demons carrying red turbans (for the use of priests) hastily arrived at the spot where Indrajit was there."
Yuddha Kanda,80,6,Weapons (such as a lance) served as blades of Shara grass (for being spread around the sacrificial fire). Chips of wood of Vibhitaka tree served as wooden sticks to feed the sacrificial fire as also red robes and iron ladles were used for cleaning and pouring clarified melted butter into the sacrificial fire.
Yuddha Kanda,80,7,"Having spread on the ground around all the sides of the sacrificial fire with other weapons along with lances, the demon seized hold of the neck of a live goat, entirely black and consigned it to the fire."
Yuddha Kanda,80,8,"Such omens as betokened victory appeared in the smokeless fire which burst into mighty flames, when it was fully aroused by that single offering."
Yuddha Kanda,80,9,"Becoming visible in person, the god of fire, who was shooting out flames towards the right and who shone brightly like refined gold, received that offering."
Yuddha Kanda,80,10,"Offering oblations in fire and gratifying the gods, the devils and demons, Indrajit ascended an excellent and splendid chariot, capable of disappearing from sight."
Yuddha Kanda,80,11,"Drawn by four horses, provided with sharp arrows and a mighty bow placed on it, that excellent chariot looked beautiful."
Yuddha Kanda,80,12,"Adorned with gold, that chariot glittered on account of its body and was decorated with carved images of antelopes, full moons and crescents."
Yuddha Kanda,80,13,"The flag-post of Indrajit shone like a flaming fire, provided, as it was, with large rings of gold and decorated with cat's eye gems."
Yuddha Kanda,80,14,"Protected by the missile presided over by Brahma, which was as efflugent as the sun, that Indrajit endowed with exceptional strength, became difficult to be attacked."
Yuddha Kanda,80,15,"Coming forth from the city and having acquired the capacity of vanishing from the sight, by offering oblations into the sacred fire, with the uttereance of spells sacred to demons, that indrajit, who was ever victorious in war, spoke as follows:"
Yuddha Kanda,80,16,"""By killing both the princes who left home to become religious mendicants in the forest in vain, I will present a gift of victory secured in the battle, to my father, Ravana today."""
Yuddha Kanda,80,17,"""By making the earth bereft of monkeys today and by killing Rama and Lakshmana, I will create a great spleasure"". Thus speaking, Indrajit vanished from thes sight."
Yuddha Kanda,80,18,"Impelled, as he was, by Ravana, the fiery Indrajit, with his barbarons bow and steel arrows, swiftly came to the battle-field enraged."
Yuddha Kanda,80,19,"That Indrajit saw the two heroes, showering a multitude of arrows. Both the princes, having mighty prowess, looked like three- hooded serpents in the middle of the monkeys."
Yuddha Kanda,80,20,"Concluding that both of them were the two princes, Rama and Lakshmana and stringing his bow, he covered them with a flood of arrows, as the rainy clouds do."
Yuddha Kanda,80,21,"That Indrajit with his chariot, reaching the sky and remaining invisible, struck Rama and Lakshmana with his sharp arrows."
Yuddha Kanda,80,22,"When enveloped by a stream of arrows Rama and Lakshamana, fitted arrows to their bows and revealed divine missiles."
Yuddha Kanda,80,23,"Though covering the sky with a net-work of arrows, the two mighty princes could not touch Indrajit with their arrows charged with mystic missiles and which were efflugent like the sun."
Yuddha Kanda,80,24,"Covering the sky, the illustrious Indrajit created a dark-like smoke. He made the quarters also invisible, by enclosing them with mist-liek darkness."
Yuddha Kanda,80,25,"While Indrajit was moving about, neither the sound produced by the impact of his palm on the bow string was heard, nor the sound of his wheels or the clattering of hoofs of his horses could be heard, nor did his form come tot he view."
Yuddha Kanda,80,26,"In that thick darkness, that long-armed Indrajit showered hails of his steel arrows, like wonderful shower of rocks."
Yuddha Kanda,80,27,"That enraged Indrajit in battle, abundantly pierced Rama in all his limbs with his arrows, which were earlier granted as boons to him and which were effluent like the sun."
Yuddha Kanda,80,28,"Both Rama and Lakshmana, the foremost of men, who were being struck with steel arrows, like two mountains being hit by torrents, released sharp golden-shafted arrows."
Yuddha Kanda,80,29,"Those arrows, adorned with plumes of heron, reaching Indrajit in the sky and piercing him, fell to the ground, soaked in blood."
Yuddha Kanda,80,30,"Shining beyond measure with a flood of arrows, the two excellent men began to chop off those arrows which were falling on them with many arrows called by the name of Bhallas."
Yuddha Kanda,80,31,"Both Rama and Lakshmana for their part directed their excellent missiles in the direction from which they saw the aforesaid sharp arrows, fallen."
Yuddha Kanda,80,32,"Indrajit for his part, who was a superior chariot-warrior and who was swift in discharging missiles, rushed on towards all sides and pierced Rama and Lakshmana with his sharp arrows."
Yuddha Kanda,80,33,"Those valiant princes, Rama and Lakshmana pierced deeply with well-made goldne shafted arrows, appeared like two Kamshuka trees in flowering."
Yuddha Kanda,80,34,"No one could perceive his rapid movement, like the position of the sun when the sky is thickly overcast with clouds, nor his form nor his bows and arrows, nor any other thing about him whatsoever could be known."
Yuddha Kanda,80,35,"Struck down by him, the monkeys were killed. The monkeys dropped dead in hundreds on the earth's surface there."
Yuddha Kanda,80,36,"Then, Lakshmana for his part was enraged and told his brother that he would employ the missile presided over by Brahma for the purpose of killing all the demons."
Yuddha Kanda,80,37,"Then, Rama spoke to that Lakshmana, who was endowed with auspicious bodily marks as follows: ""You ought not to kill all the demons on earth, merely for the sake of a single demon."""
Yuddha Kanda,80,38,"""You ought not to kill on this earth one who is not fighting or one who is hiding or one who seeks refuge with joined palms or is fleeing or is intoxicated."""
Yuddha Kanda,80,39,"""O long-armed Lakshmana! We shall try to kill Indrajit alone. We will employ mystic mssiles with great impetuosity and which are equal to venomous serpents."""
Yuddha Kanda,80,40,"""On seeing this demons, the leaders of mokey-troops will forcibly kill this petty demon, who is skilled in conjuring tricks and whose chariot remains invisible."""
Yuddha Kanda,80,41,"""Scorched by my mystic missiles, he will fall dead on the ground, even if he enters the earth or into heaven or into the subterrranean world or penetrates the vault of heaven and remains completely hidden in this manner."""
Yuddha Kanda,80,42,"Speaking highly meaningful words in the aforesaid manner, the great-souled Rama, surrounded by the foremost of monkeys, started to reflect on the speedy means of killing the furious Indrajit, the demons of cruel deeds."
Yuddha Kanda,81,1,"Guessing the mind of that great-souled Rama, Indrajit turning away from that battle, entered the City."
Yuddha Kanda,81,2,"Then, recalling the killing of those energetic demons like Kumbhakarna and others, that valiant Indrajit sallied forth (for the fight) with red-hot eyes in anger."
Yuddha Kanda,81,3,"That Indrajit, of very great prowess, the adversary of gods and who was born in Sage Pulstya's dynasty, accompanied by an army of demons, came forth from the western gate."
Yuddha Kanda,81,4,"Seeing the two valiant brothers, Rama and Lakshamana, who were prepared for the encounter, Indrajit for his part, then started to demonstrate his conjuring tricks."
Yuddha Kanda,81,5,"Placing an illusory image of Seetha on his chariot and a large army surrounding the chariot, Indrajit intended to kill her."
Yuddha Kanda,81,6,"Making up his mind to purposefully confuse all, by playing a trick to kill Seetha's illusory image, the exceedingly evil-minded Indrajit sallied forth towards the direction of the monkeys."
Yuddha Kanda,81,7,"Seeing him coming forth towards their direction, all those monkeys were enraged and bounced towards him, with rocks in their hands and with an intent to fight."
Yuddha Kanda,81,8,"Hanuma, the foremost among the monkeys, taking hold of a very large mountain-peak, which was difficult to be reached by others, marched in front."
Yuddha Kanda,81,9,"That Hanuma saw Seetha, the wife of Rama, the best among women, bereft of joy, wearing only a single braid of hair, looking miserable, with her face emaciated due to fasting, dressed in a single worn-out clothing, unadorned and with all her limbs covered with dust and dirt; in the chaiot of Indrajit."
Yuddha Kanda,81,10,"On seeing her for a moment, Hanuma ascertained her as Seetha and became dejected. That Seetha was indeed seen by him, not long ago."
Yuddha Kanda,81,11,"Seeing her stricken with grief bereft of joy, looking distreseed, miserable and sitting under the sway of Indrajit, Hanuma wondered as to what his intention might be. Thus thinking, he along with those leaders of mnkeys, rushed towards Indrajit."
Yuddha Kanda,81,12,"Beholding that army of monkeys, Indrajit was excited with anger, pulled Seetha by the hair on her head and unsheathed his sword."
Yuddha Kanda,81,13,"While those monkeys were seeing, demon began to strike that woman who was placed in the chariot by the dint of his conjuring trick and who was crying ""Rama! Rama!"""
Yuddha Kanda,81,14,"On seeing her seized by the hair Hanuma the son of wind-god was confounded with affliction and shed tears, in agony from his eyes."
Yuddha Kanda,81,15,"On seeing Seetha with all her charming limbs, the beloved wife of Rama, Hanuma angrily addressed the foolowing harsh words to Indrajit:"
Yuddha Kanda,81,16,"""O evil minded one! Born in a dynasty of Brahmanical sages, but belonging to demoniacal race, you touched a lock of her hair, for your hair, for your own ruin."""
Yuddha Kanda,81,17,"""O cruel, vulgar and mean fellow! O wicked demon of sinful prowess! O pitiless fellow! Woe be to you, of sinful conduct, in whom such a resolve has taken place. Such an act is worthy of a barbarian. There is no pity in you."""
Yuddha Kanda,81,18,"""O pitiless one! Seetha came away from her house, from her kingdom and from her huband's (Rama's) protection. What wrong has Seetha done to you, that you are killing her?"""
Yuddha Kanda,81,19,"""By killing Seetha, you will not survivie for long in any way. O demon, desrving of death! By your act, you indeed fell into my hands."""
Yuddha Kanda,81,20,"""Abandoning your life in this world, you shall, after death, descend to those worlds which are the lot of the killers of women and are condemned even by those who deserved to be killed by the people."""
Yuddha Kanda,81,21,"Thus speaking, Hanuma surrounded as he was by monkeys with their weapons and very much enraged, rushed headlong towards Indrajit."
Yuddha Kanda,81,22,The army of demons of terrible rage intercepted that army of mokeys possessing a high prowess and advancing towards them.
Yuddha Kanda,81,23,"Stirring up that army of mokeys with a multitude of his arrows, Indrajit replied to Hanuma, the foremost of mokeys as follows:"
Yuddha Kanda,81,24,"""For whose sake, Sugreeva, yourself and Rama came here, I am going to kill Seetha now itself, while you stand looking on."""
Yuddha Kanda,81,25,"""O monkey! After killing her, I will make a short work of Rama, Lakshmana, yourself too, Sugreeva and that vulgar Vibhishana thereafter."""
Yuddha Kanda,81,26,"""O monkey! What you have said just now viz. that women are not to be killed, is correct. But that which causes tormentation to the enemies indeed needs to be done."""
Yuddha Kanda,81,27,"Having spoken thus to Hanuma, Indrajit personally killed that illusory Seetha, who ahd been sobbing all the while, with his sharp-edged sword."
Yuddha Kanda,81,28,"Split asunder by him diagonally, that miserable lady of broad hips and pleasant to the sight, fell down on the ground."
Yuddha Kanda,81,29,"After killing that woman, Indrajit told Hanuma as follows: ""See, I killed Rama's wife with my weapon. This Seetha is dead and all your labour is in vain."""
Yuddha Kanda,81,30,"After killing her with a large sword personally, that Indrajit then sitting on his chariot, pleasurefully roared loudly."
Yuddha Kanda,81,31,"The monkeys standing in vicinity heard his roar, even as he shouted with his mouth wide open, while comfortable sitting in that tower of the aerial chriot, which was actually difficult of access for others."
Yuddha Kanda,81,32,"After killing Seetha in that way, the evil-minded Indrajit became exceedingly glad. Seeing him exceedingly pleased, the monkeys looked dejected and suddenly ran away."
Yuddha Kanda,82,1,"Hearing that terrific roar, similar to the sound of Indra's thunderbolt, the monkeys looking hither and thither, ran away in all directions."
Yuddha Kanda,82,2,"Then, Hanuma the son of wind-god spoke (as follows) to all those monkeys, who were running away widely apart, looking dejected, miserable and frightened."
Yuddha Kanda,82,3,"""O, monkeys! Why are you running away, looking dejected and leaving your zeal to fight? Where has your valour gone?"""
Yuddha Kanda,82,4,"""Come along closely behind me, while I am marching ahead in the battle. For the valiant who are born in a good family, it is not indeed proper to shrink back from the battle."""
Yuddha Kanda,82,5,"Hearing the words of that wise Hanuma, the monkeys in a cheerful mood, took hold of mountain-peaks and trees in a great fury."
Yuddha Kanda,82,6,"The foremost of monkeys, while roaring, rushed towards the demons. They followed him, by surrounding Hanuma on all sides, in that great battle."
Yuddha Kanda,82,7,"That Hanuma, being surrounded by those monkey-chiefs on all sides, began to consume that army of adversaries as a flaming fire."
Yuddha Kanda,82,8,"That Hanuma, accompanied by his army of monkeys, brought about the destruction of demons, as Yama the lord of death does at the time of universal dissolution."
Yuddha Kanda,82,9,"Filled with inordinate grief and rage, that Hanuma the monkey-chief, threw a large rock on Indrajit's chariot."
Yuddha Kanda,82,10,"On seeing that rock rushing towards them, the obedient horses, yoked to that chariot, carried the chariot off to a far-distance."
Yuddha Kanda,82,11,"That rock employed in vain, without reaching that Indrajit and his charioteer sitting in the chariot, split itself into fragments and penetrated the ground."
Yuddha Kanda,82,12,The demons were very much bruised by the falling fragments of the rock. That army of demons was perturbed over the rock thus falling upon them.
Yuddha Kanda,82,13,"Hundreds of monkeys with their colossal bodies, lifting up trees and mountain-peaks, rushed roaring towards Indrajit."
Yuddha Kanda,82,14,"Those monkeys of terrible prowess, threw trees and mountain-peaks towards Indrajit in battle. While shooting a large deluge of trees and rocks, the monkeys caused destruction of their enemies. They roared in various high tones."
Yuddha Kanda,82,15,"Beaten forcibly with trees, by those highly terrible monkeys, those demons of frightful appearance, rolled about restlessly in the battle-field."
Yuddha Kanda,82,16,"On seeing his army tormented by the monkeys, that enraged Indrajit, taking hold of his weapons, sallied forth, facing towards his enemies."
Yuddha Kanda,82,17,"That Indrajit, of firm fortitude, accompanied by his army, by releasing a multitude of arrows, killed a very many number of monkeys."
Yuddha Kanda,82,18,"In the battle, Indrajit's soldiers too killed the monkeys with spikes tips of missiles, swords, sharp-edged spears and concealed weapons similar to mallets."
Yuddha Kanda,82,19,"The mighty Hanuma played a havoc among demons of terrible deeds, with Shala trees, distinguished by excellent trunks and branches as with rocks."
Yuddha Kanda,82,20,"Keeping the hostile army back, that Hanuma spoke to those monkeys as follows: ""Retreat! This army need not be conquered any more by us."""

Yuddha Kanda,82,25,"Arriving at Nikumbhila, Indrajit poured oblations into the sacred fire. Thereupon, while being propitiated by that demon on reaching sacrificial ground, the sacrificial fire then blazed up on consuming the oblations of flesh and blood."
Yuddha Kanda,82,26,"Swollen up when propitiated with oblations of blood, the highly intense fire, like the evening sun, appeared wrapped in flames."
Yuddha Kanda,82,27,"Then, Indrajit, well-versed with the technique of performance of rites for the prosperity of the demons, poured oblations according to the scriptural precepts. Seeing this, those demons, who knew what was prudent and evil in major battles, stood firm in big piles (by Indrajit's side)."

Yuddha Kanda,83,6,"Seeing that terrible army of bears, looking like a dark cloud on their way, ready (to perform battle) and effectively intercepting it, Hanuma retreated them all."
Yuddha Kanda,83,7,"Quickly seeking the presence of Rama with that army, the highly illustrious Hanuma, with sorrow, spoke the following words to Rama:"

Yuddha Kanda,83,9,"""O destroyer of enemies! On seeing her with my distressed mind, I felt sad. I came to report the event to you."""
Yuddha Kanda,83,10,"Hearing those words of Hanuma, Rama then was agitated with grief and fell down on the ground, like a tree with its bottom chopped off."
Yuddha Kanda,83,11,"On seeing that Rama, who with the semblance of god, falling on the ground, the chiefs of monkeys came bouncing from all sides and rushed towards him."
Yuddha Kanda,83,12,"They sprinkled him with water, fragrant with scent of lotuses and lilies, as one would sprinkle an inextinguishable as one would sprinkle an inextinguishable fire, which has just flared up suddenly and is burning all."

Yuddha Kanda,83,20,"Since prosperities of those, in whom unrighteousness is rooted, develop; while those who have a conduct of virtue suffer, hence these two (virtue and vice) are useless."

Yuddha Kanda,88,75,"Then, to relieve martial weariness of Lakshmana, who did not experience defeat in any facet of war, the great-souled Vibhishana, offering agreeable and salutary words, took up his position, on reaching the battle-field."
Yuddha Kanda,89,1,"Seeing Lakshmana and Indrajit, fighting with commitment to gain victory one over the other, like elephants in rut, that strong and valiant Vibhishana, wielding his excellent bow, stood there at the battle-front, with an intent to behold their combat."

Yuddha Kanda,90,12,"Seeing Idnrajit seated in the chariot, Lakshmana, the mighty monkeys and Vibhishana the demon then were very much surprised on recalling the alacrity of the intelligent Indrajit."
Yuddha Kanda,90,13,The enraged Indrajit also struck down hundreds and thousands of monkey-chiefs by using a multitude of arrows in the battle-field.

Yuddha Kanda,90,40,"Just leaping down from the chariot whose charioteer was destroyed earlier and whose horses were killed, that Indrajit of great splendor employed his javelin towards his maternal uncle."
Yuddha Kanda,90,41,"Seeing that Javelin rushing towards Vibhishana, Lakshmana tore it into ten pieces with his sharp arrows and felled it on the floor."
Yuddha Kanda,90,42,"The strong bodied Vibhishana, in anger, dug five arrows, whose impact was a hard as that of a thunder-bolt, into the bosom of Indrajit, whose horses were already killed."
Yuddha Kanda,90,43,"Having penetrated his body, those arrows which were provided with golden feathers, went straight into their target, got stained with blood and appeared like red large serpents."
Yuddha Kanda,90,44,"Enraged with his paternal uncle, that Indrajit, standing in the midst of demons, took hold of an excellent arrow earlier presented by Yama the lord of Death."
Yuddha Kanda,90,45,"Seeing that great arrow seized by him, Lakshmana also, of great splendor and terrible prowess, took hold of another arrow."
Yuddha Kanda,90,46,"That arrow had been presented to him, in the course of a dream, by Kubera the god of riches, of immense glory himself, which was difficult to be conquered and much more difficult to be tolerated even for gods and demons including Indra the lord of celestials."
Yuddha Kanda,90,47,"Stretched with strength by their arms, which resembled a pair of steel rods, emitted a piercing sound like that of a pair of curlew-cranes."
Yuddha Kanda,90,48,"The excellent arrows fitted and pulled out from their excellent bow by those heroes, blazed very much with splendour."
Yuddha Kanda,90,49,"Those arrows, released from the bow, making the sky shine and hitting each other face to face, collided each other powerfully."
Yuddha Kanda,90,50,The collision of those arrows of terrible form broke out a fierce fire comprising of smoke and sparkles.
Yuddha Kanda,90,51,"Hitting each other like two major planets, those two arrows in battle burst into a hundred pieces and fell on the ground."
Yuddha Kanda,90,52,"On seeing their arrows warded off in the battle-front, those two warriors, Lakshmana and Indrajit then felt abashed and got provoked."
Yuddha Kanda,90,53,"Getting excited, Lakshmana took hold of a missile presided over by Varuna (the god of water). Skilled in warfare, the great Indrajit too discharged a missile presided over by Rudra (the god of destruction) in battle."
Yuddha Kanda,90,54,"By that Rudra missile, that very wonderful Varuna-missile was struck. Then, that enraged Indrajit of great splendour and the conqueror of battle, looking like the destroyer of the world, employed a missile presided over by Agni the god of fire which was blazing."
Yuddha Kanda,90,55,"The valiant Lakshmana obstructed Agni-missile, by a missile presided over by the sun-god. Finding his missile repelled, Indrajit was filled with anger and took hold of a sharp arrow used by demons and capable of tearing down an enemy."
Yuddha Kanda,90,56,"From that bow, blazing weapon similar to a hammer duly hidden, darts, fire arms, maces, swords and axes rushed forth."
Yuddha Kanda,90,57,"Seeing that terrible missile, which was very harsh, unrestrainable for all beings and which can tear all weapons in battle, the brilliant Lakshmana obstructed that missile by using Maheswara-missile."
Yuddha Kanda,90,58,"There was a wonderful battle between both of them, causing hair to stand erect. The beings in the sky surrounded Lakshmana."
Yuddha Kanda,90,59,"Surrounded by many surprised beings in that terrible battle taking place between monkeys and demons, yielding terrific noise, the sky sparkled."
Yuddha Kanda,90,60,"Placing Indra the lord of celestials as their head, the sages, manes, gods, Gandharvas the celestial musicians, eagles and serpents protected Lakshmana in the battle-field."
Yuddha Kanda,90,61,"Then, Lakshmana fitted another excellent arrow, which had a sensation of ignition and which can tear down Indrajit."
Yuddha Kanda,90,62,"The heroic Lakshmana fitted the arrow, having beautiful plumes, which consisted of rounded parts, well-jointed, skillfully fashioned, decked with gold, capable of destroying the body of the enemies, not difficult to keep off but difficult even to tolerate, a source of terror to the demons as deadly as the venom of poisonous snakes and duly honoured by the host of gods."
Yuddha Kanda,90,63,"With the help of that arrow, the highly powerful and valiant Indra, the lord of celestials, who had green horses to his chariot, was able to conquer the demons in a combat which raged between celestials and demons."
Yuddha Kanda,90,64,"Fitting a missile presided over by Indra the lord of celestials, which had never been defeated in battle, to his excellent bow and drawing it, the glorious Lakshmana addressed the following prayer, which was intended to achieve his purpose:"
Yuddha Kanda,90,65,"""O my dear arrow! If Rama the son of Dasaratha has set his mind on virtue, keeps up his promise and is second to none in his prowess, destroy this Indrajit."""
Yuddha Kanda,90,66,"Thus saying and drawing up to the ear the arrow, which went straight, the heroic Lakshmana released it towards Indrajit."

Yuddha Kanda,90,70,"As Indrajit was killed, all those monkeys together with Vibhishana roared in rejoice, as the celestials did, when Vritra the demon was killed."
Yuddha Kanda,90,71,"Then, a shout of victory rose in the sky from the mouth of gods, great-souled sages, Gandharvas the celestial musicians and the celestial nymphs."
Yuddha Kanda,90,72,"Seeing him fallen, that great army of demons, being struck by monkeys shining with victory, sought the quarters."
Yuddha Kanda,90,73,"Abandoning their weapons, while being struck by the monkeys, those demons went towards Lanka, running fast stupefied."
Yuddha Kanda,90,74,"All those frightened demons, abandoning their weapons sharp-edged spears, swords and axes ran away in hundreds to various directions."
Yuddha Kanda,90,75,"Tormented by the monkeys, some were scared and entered Lanka. Some fell into the ocean. Some took refuge in the mountain."
Yuddha Kanda,90,76,"Seeing Indrajit killed and lying on the battle-field, not even one among the thousands of demons was to be seen."
Yuddha Kanda,90,77,"As the sun-rays do not exist when the sun has sunk below the horizon, so those demons left to different directions when Indrajit had fallen."
Yuddha Kanda,90,78,"Thrown asunder and dead, that long-armed Indrajit looked like the sun whose rays have cooled down and like the fire which is extinguished."
Yuddha Kanda,90,79,"When Indrajit was fallen, the world then had its oppressions pacified, now that its enemy had been destroyed and it experience a rejoice."
Yuddha Kanda,90,80,"While that demon of sinful deeds is having been killed, the illustrious Indra the ruler of gods along with all the great sages were rejoiced."
Yuddha Kanda,90,81,"In the sky too was heard the sound of large drums played by celestials, the melody produced by dancing Apsaras the celestial nymphs and the songs of Gandharvas the celestial musicians."
Yuddha Kanda,90,82,"While that demon of cruel deeds was killed, a deluge of flowers rained along with showers of praises. It was a wonderful scene."
Yuddha Kanda,90,83,"While that Indrajit, who was the terror of all the worlds, had fallen, the waters and the sky became clear. The celestials and demons were rejoiced and arrived on the scene."
Yuddha Kanda,90,84,"The gratified celestials, Gandharvas the celestial musicians and the demons said: ""Let the Brahmanas move about cheerfully, now that their trouble has ceased."""
Yuddha Kanda,90,85,"Seeing that foremost among demons, who was unrivalled in battle, having been killed, the rejoiced monkey-chiefs applauded Lakshmana."
Yuddha Kanda,90,86,"Vibhishana, Hanuma and Jambavan the chief of bears were pleased at Lakshmana for his victor and applauded him too."
Yuddha Kanda,90,87,"The monkeys, who accomplished their aim, roaring, jumping with joy and emitting thundering sounds, stood encircling Lakshmana."
Yuddha Kanda,90,88,"Wagging their tails and lashing them, the monkeys then gave forth the slogan, ""Victorious is Lakshmana!"""

Yuddha Kanda,91,1,"Lakshmana, endowed with auspicious bodily marks, whose limbs were drenched in blood, felt rejoiced on having killed Indrajit in combat."
Yuddha Kanda,91,2,"Having offered salutation to Jambavan, Hanuma and all those monkeys, that valiant Lakshmana of great brilliance then quickly came from there to the place where Sugreeva and Rama were there, by leaning himself upon vibhishana and Hanuma."
Yuddha Kanda,91,3,"Having offered his salutation and approached Rama, Lakshmana stood beside his brother, even as Lord Vamana (the younger brother of Indra) would stand beside Indra the lord of celestials."

Yuddha Kanda,91,11,"""As that evil-minded enenmy has been killed, I become victorious. O valiant Lakshmana! Fortunately, you indeed severed the right hand of the cruel Ravana. Indrajit is indeed the support for that Ravana. Vibhishana and Hanuma too performed a great feat in the great battle."""
Yuddha Kanda,91,12,"""In the course of three days and nights, the valiant Indrajit was felled down somehow. Now, I have been made free of enemies. Hearing of his son having been struck down, Ravana will indeed come forth with a great and powerful battle-array."""

Yuddha Kanda,91,17,"Let Lakshmana along with Vibhishana be quickly made free from pain caused by the arrows that have penetrated into their body. Let all others too among the gallant bear and monkey-warriors fighting with trees who have fought on the battle-field here and stand pierced with arrows and owunded, be healed in the same way with great care."""
Yuddha Kanda,91,18,"As commanded by Rama, the great-souled Sushena, the monkey-cheif gave an excellent medicine through nose to Lakshmana."
Yuddha Kanda,91,19,"Inhaling the odour of that herb, Lakshmana became healed of the arrow-wounds, free from pains and his wounds got completely cured."
Yuddha Kanda,91,20,"As per the order of Rama, Sushena then treated his companions like Vibhishana and others including all the monkey-chiefs."
Yuddha Kanda,91,21,"Then, with his arrow-wounds healed, his fatigue gone and his feverishness cured within a moment, Lakshmana having restored his original disposition, felt joyful there."

Yuddha Kanda,91,23,"That great-souled Rama apllauded the ardous feat of Lakshmana. Hearing of Indrajit having been kille din battle, Sugreeva became delighted."

Yuddha Kanda,92,19,"While he was yawning with anger; a fire with smoke, as though clearly burning, broke out from his mouth, as it did from the month of Vritra (in the former days)."
Yuddha Kanda,92,20,"Afflicted with the grief of his son's killing, that valiant Ravana got wrapped up in wrath and pondering with his mind, craved for the killing of Seetha."
Yuddha Kanda,92,21,"The dreadful eyes of that Ravana, which were red in colour by their very nature and were red even by the fire of his wrath, looked glittering."
Yuddha Kanda,92,22,"That naturally terrific form of Ravana, filled with the fire of his wrath, became difficult to be approached, like the form of enraged Rudra the god of destruction."

Yuddha Kanda,93,27,"The created beings saw that Rama in the form of a discus, which was killing the demons on the battle-field, like the ""Wheel of Time"", for its flame, the arrows for its spokes, his bow for the felly of the wheel, the twanging of the bow-string and the clanging of the gauntlet for the sound produced for its revolution, his energy and the virtues for its radiance and the power of his mystic missiles for its edge."
Yuddha Kanda,93,28,"Within a matter of three hours, with his arrows looking like tongues of flames, Rama killed an army of demons, capable of changing their form at will, including ten thousands chariots possessing the swiftness of the wind, eighteen thousand strong elephants, fourteen thousand horses with their riders and a full two lacs of demons fighting on foot."
Yuddha Kanda,93,29,"Those surviving demons, with their horses killed, with their chariots destroyed, with thier flag-staffs broken and with broken spirits, rushed back towards the City of Lanka."
Yuddha Kanda,93,30,"That battle-field, with elephants, foot-soldiers and horses killed, looked like a pleasure-grave of the powerful and the enraged the lord of destruction."
Yuddha Kanda,93,31,"Then, the celestials along with Gandharvas the celestial musicians, holy saints and great sages acclaimed that feat of Rama, saying ""well done, well done!""."
Yuddha Kanda,93,32,"Then, the virtuous Rama spoke also to Sugreeva, Vibhishana, Hanuma the monkey, Jambavan, Mainda the foremost of monkeys and even Dvivida, who were in close proximity to him as follows ""Such wonderful power of this missile exists either with me or with the three-eyed Rudra the lord of destruction."""
Yuddha Kanda,93,33,"Rama, a compeer of Indra the lord of celestials, the great souled, unwearied in the use of weapons and missiles, having destroyed that army of demons, was applauded by the rejoiced troops of celestials."
Yuddha Kanda,94,1,"Rama, who was unweary in action, with his shining arrows adorned with pure gold, killed those thousands of elephants dispatched by Ravana, thousands of horses, valiant demons who can change their form at will mounted on thousands of chariots with their flag-staffs, having the colour of fire, fighting with maces and iron rods and conspicuous with their golden banners."
Yuddha Kanda,94,2,"Seeing and hearing about the killing of the demons, the surviving demons well frightened, looked sad and were overwhelmed with anxiety. They wailed when they met their wives. All female-demons who lost their husbands, sons and kinsfolk met at one place, stricken as they were with sorrow, wailed as follows:"
Yuddha Kanda,94,3,"""How did the old and ugly Surpanakha, of sunken belly, approach, in the forest, Rama who is charming like the god of love?"""
Yuddha Kanda,94,4,"""How strange that on seeing that Rama of tender youth, endowed with extraordinary strength and devoted to the welfare of all created beings, that ugly woman (Surpanakha) who deserved to be condemned by the people, was stung with excessive lust?"""
Yuddha Kanda,94,5,"""How that ugly-faced demoness, who is bereft of all virtues, dared to make love to Rama, who is full of virtues, endowed with great bodily strength and who possessed a charming countenance?"""
Yuddha Kanda,94,6,"""Because of the ill-luck of these people, and to the destruction of demons and of Dushana and Khara, that grey-haired and disgusting woman, who had developed wrinkles, tried to be arrogant with Rama, misdeed which was worth ridiculing and condemned by the whole world."""

Yuddha Kanda,94,37,"Then, all female-demons, embracing each other in their arms, afflicted as they were with grief and tormented with excessive fear, lamented thus and wept loudly and severely."
Yuddha Kanda,95,1,Ravana for his part heard the mournful and plaintive cry of the afflicted female-demons in every house at Lanka.
Yuddha Kanda,95,2,"Sighing for a long time and remaining engrossed in reflection for a while, that Ravana was very much enraged and assumed a frightful appearance."
Yuddha Kanda,95,3,"Nipping his lips with his teeth, his eyes becoming blood-red with anger, and his sight becoming difficult to endure even for the demons, Ravana looked like the augmented fire of dissolution."
Yuddha Kanda,95,4,"Ravana, in words indistinct with anger as though consuming them with his glance, ordered the demons, standing there near him, viz. Mahodara, Mahaparshva and Virupaksha, the demon (as follows): ""Tell the armies asking them to start immediately, as per my command."""
Yuddha Kanda,95,5,"Hearing that command of Ravana, those demons were tormented with fear and enjoined those armies of demons, who felt unagitated, in accordance with the orders of the king."

Yuddha Kanda,95,7,"Paying reverence to Ravana according to the rules of propriety, all those great car-warriors stood with joined palms, wishing victory to their lord."
Yuddha Kanda,95,8,"Laughing heartily, Ravana then, stupefied as he was with anger, spoke to those demons viz. Mahodara, Mahaparshva and Virupaksha, the demons as follows:"

Yuddha Kanda,95,15,"""With their faces transfixed with arrows, the monkey-leaders, lying on the battle-field today will adorn the earth as with lotuses together with the stalks."""
Yuddha Kanda,95,16,"""With each arrow released in battle today, I shall tear one hundred full of monkeys, the most furious of their troop, fighting with trees."""
Yuddha Kanda,95,17,"""By killing the enemy today, I shall wipe off the tears of those demons, who lost their brothers and sons."""
Yuddha Kanda,95,18,"""With the monkeys pierced with my arrows, lying scattered in the battle-field and bereft of their lives today, I shall cover the earth so fully, that it would be possible to see its surface only with effort."""

Yuddha Kanda,95,20,"""Arrange my chariot quickly. Bring my bow swiftly. Let all the remaining demons here, follow me to the combat."""
Yuddha Kanda,95,21,"Hearing that command of Ravana, Mahaparshva ordered the army-chiefs, standing there, as follows: ""let the army be made ready quickly."""
Yuddha Kanda,95,22,"Going around the city of Lanka, the army-chiefs for their part, with quick resolution, joined hand in hand and hastened the demons in every house to set out for the battle."
Yuddha Kanda,95,23,"The demons, of terrible aspect and having awful faces, then roaring, with their arms equipped with various weapons viz. swords, sharp-edged darts, pikes, maces, clubs, plough-like weapons, sharp-edged javelins, huge Kutas and Mudgara, staffs, discuses of every kind, sharpened axes, slings for throwing stones, stones or cylindrical wooden pieces with iron pikes and other excellent weapons, rushed out within a moment."
Yuddha Kanda,95,24,"Then, as per the orders of Ravana, the army-commander hurriedly brought a chariot, moving swiftly, along with a charioteer and yoked with eight horses. Thereupon, the awful Ravana mounted that chariot, shining with his own splendour."
Yuddha Kanda,95,25,"Then, surrounded by several demons, Ravana sallied forth quickly, as though he was cracking the earth with a profundity of his strength."
Yuddha Kanda,95,26,"Thereupon, a great noise emanated on all sides from tabors, drums, Kettle-drums and counches along with the clamour of the demons."
Yuddha Kanda,95,27,"A clamour was heard, saying ""There comes the ruler of demons, the abductor of Seetha, the destroyer of Brahmanas, the enemy of gods, notorious for his bad conduct, accompanied by his canopy and pair of whisks, to fight with Rama, the foremost among the Raghu dynasty."""
Yuddha Kanda,95,28,"By that huge sound, the earth trembled. Hearing that sound suddenly, the monkeys ran away in fear."
Yuddha Kanda,95,29,"The long-armed Ravana, for his part, with extra-ordinary energy, surrounded by his ministers, turned up for victory in quest of victory."
Yuddha Kanda,95,30,"Mahaparshva and Mahodara as also Virupaksha, who was difficult to overpower, as order by Ravana, then ascended their chariots."
Yuddha Kanda,95,31,"Those demons, roaring elatedly, as though cracking the earth, and emitting an awfull uproar, sallied forth, longing for victory."
Yuddha Kanda,95,32,"Then, the powerful Ravana, resembling the all-destroying Time in the form of Yama, along with his army-troops of demons, set out for the battle with his raised bow."
Yuddha Kanda,95,33,"Then, that Ravana, the great chariot-warrior, ascending his chariot driven by swift horses, sallied forth to the gate, where Rama and Lakshmana were."
Yuddha Kanda,95,34,"Then, the sun lost its radiance. The quarters too were enveloped in darkness. The birds emitted fearful notes. The earth too trembled violently."
Yuddha Kanda,95,35,The cloud rained blood. The horses stumbled. A vulture descended on the top of the ensign. Jackals emitted sinister howls.
Yuddha Kanda,95,36,His left eye too throbbed. His left arm trembled. He became pale-faced. His voice was a little lowered.
Yuddha Kanda,95,37,"When Ravana the demon was sallying forth for the battle, the following evil phenomena, predicting his death, appeared in the battle-field."
Yuddha Kanda,95,38,"A meteor with a sound similar to a thunder, fell down from the sky. Ill-omened vultures together with crows cried out aloud."
Yuddha Kanda,95,39,"Ignoring these dreadful bad omens due to his ignorance, Ravana marched forward for the purpose of the massacre in battle, driven as he was by fate."
Yuddha Kanda,95,40,"On hearing the sound of the chariot of those mighty demons, that army of monkeys too returned for the fight."
Yuddha Kanda,95,41,"A tumultuous battle ensued between those monkeys and demons, who were fond of victory and summoning each other for combat with rage."
Yuddha Kanda,95,42,"Thereupon, the enraged Ravana, with his arrows decked with that army of monkeys."
Yuddha Kanda,95,43,Some monkeys had their heads chopped off by Ravana. Some had their hearts pierced. Some were made deprived of their ears.
Yuddha Kanda,95,44,Some were struck down breathless. Some were torn in their ribs. Some had their skulls smashed. Some were deprived of their eyes.
Yuddha Kanda,95,45,"Whichever side Ravana was coming in his chariot on the battle-field, his eyes rolling in anger, those monkey-warriors, on that side, could not with stand the rapidity of his arrows."
Yuddha Kanda,96,1,"The battle-field there, on its part, was strewn on that occasion with those monkeys whose bodies had thus been torn asunder by Ravana with his arrows."
Yuddha Kanda,96,2,"Those monkeys could not bear that irresistible descent of arrows loosed by Ravana, any more than moths would bear a blazing fire."
Yuddha Kanda,96,3,"Those monkeys tormented by sharp arrows, fled away roaring, as elephants run away, when enveloped in flames of fire and getting scorched by them."
Yuddha Kanda,96,4,"Ravana was marching forward swiftly in that battle-field, blowing away the army of monkeys, like the wind blows away large clouds."
Yuddha Kanda,96,5,"Having brought about with his might the destruction of those monkeys in battle, Ravana quickly approached Rama on the battle-field."
Yuddha Kanda,96,6,"Seeing those monkeys running away in defeat in that battle, Sugreeva kept Sushena in charge of his army and quickly threw his mind into the fight."
Yuddha Kanda,96,7,"Keeping that Sushena who was equal to himself, his substitute, that Sugreeva, armed with the tree as a weapon, marched forward towards the enemy."
Yuddha Kanda,96,8,"Taking huge rocks and various kinds of trees, all the monkey-warriors followed Sugreeva at his side and behind."
Yuddha Kanda,96,9,"The gigantic Sugreeva roared at a high pitch in the battle-field. Striking with his blows, he crushed various other chiefs of demons."
Yuddha Kanda,96,10,"The colossal bodied Sugreeva smashed the demons, as the grown-up trees are smashed by the wind at the time of dissolution of the world."
Yuddha Kanda,96,11,"Sugreeva rained a hail of rocks on the army of demons, as a cloud rains a shower of hail-stones on a host of birds in a forest."
Yuddha Kanda,96,12,"While those demons, thus defeated by Sugreeva, falling on the floor and then roaring, get diminished in number from all sides, the indomitable Virupaksha the demon, holding a bow, pronouncing his name by himself, descended from his chariot and mounted the back of an elephant."
Yuddha Kanda,96,13,"That mighty Virupaksha, mounting that elephant, then roared a terrific noise and rushed towards the monkeys."
Yuddha Kanda,96,14,"Virupaksha released dreadful arrows on Sugreeva who was at the front-rank of the army. He strengthened his support to the worried demons, by cheering them up."
Yuddha Kanda,96,15,"Sugreeva, the king of monkeys, when he was struck severely with sharp arrows by that demon, shouted loudly. With profuse anger, he set his mind on killing him."
Yuddha Kanda,96,16,"Uplifting a tree and coming near that huge elephant, the valiant Sugreeva, a thorough fighter, struck it on its face."
Yuddha Kanda,96,17,"That huge elephant, struck with the blow of Sugreeva, receded to a distance of four yards, sank down and roared too."
Yuddha Kanda,96,18,"Descending quickly from his wounded elephant, that valiant demon then seizing hold of his sword from a shield made of a bull's hide and advancing in rapid paces, facing towards Sugreeva his enemy, approached him, who stood firm, threatening him as it were."
Yuddha Kanda,96,19,"Taking a huge rock, which looked like a cloud, that Sugreeva, who felt enraged, threw it on Virupaksha."
Yuddha Kanda,96,20,"Seeing that rock falling, that highly valiant and excellent of demons then receding away, struck him with a sword."
Yuddha Kanda,96,21,"Wounded by the blow of the sword of that strong demon, Sugreeva became as though unconscious on the ground, for a moment."
Yuddha Kanda,96,22,"Then, bouncing up suddenly in that great battle, Sugreeva, tightening his fist, brought it down on the demon's chest violently."
Yuddha Kanda,96,23,"Feeling enraged, when struck by the blow of that fist, Virupaksha the demon brought down the armour of Sugreeva by his sword at the battle-front. Thus struck by him, Sugreeva fell down from his feet."
Yuddha Kanda,96,24,"Getting up when fallen, Sugreeva gave him a slap, which produced a terrific sound similar to a thunder."
Yuddha Kanda,96,25,"Setting himself free from that slap, which was about to be raised by Sugreeva skillfully, Virupaksha the demon struck Sugreeva on the chest with his fist."
Yuddha Kanda,96,26,"Then, seeing that demon escaping his blow, Sugreeva the monkey-king for his part, very much enraged."
Yuddha Kanda,96,27,"That monkey saw an opportunity to strike that Virupaksha. Then, with anger, Sugreeva brought down another violent slap on his temple-bone."
Yuddha Kanda,96,28,"Virupaksha, struck by the blow of that palm, which was like the thunderbolt to the ground, oozing blood profusely from the (nine) apertures* of his body, as water flows from the spring."
Yuddha Kanda,96,29,"The monkeys saw Virupaksha, bathed in foaming blood, with his eyes rolling through anger and as such rendered all the more deformed.*"
Yuddha Kanda,96,30,"The monkeys saw their enemy, bathed in blood, turning to and from as also throbbing on his sides and roaring piteously."
Yuddha Kanda,96,31,"Confronting together in the battle-field in that way, those two violent and terrific armies which were extensive as oceans, of monkeys and demons, roared like two large oceans which had burst their bounds."
Yuddha Kanda,96,32,"Beholding that mighty Virupaksha killed by Sugreeva, the army of monkeys and demons together looked like the agitated river of Ganga."
Yuddha Kanda,97,1,"Being killed by each other in that major battle, those two armies were very much diminished soon, like two lakes in a severe summer."
Yuddha Kanda,97,2,Ravana the lord of demons got doubly enraged because of the destroyal of his own army and the fall of Virupaksha.
Yuddha Kanda,97,3,He felt restless to find his own army diminished while being killed by the monkeys and to see the reversal of his fate.
Yuddha Kanda,97,4,"He spoke to Mahodara, the annihilator of enemies, standing beside him (as follows): ""O the long-armed! At this juncture, my hope for victory is centered in you."""
Yuddha Kanda,97,5,"""O the brave demon! Destroy the army of our enemies. Show your prowess now. This is the time to repay the debt of your master (received in the form of sustenance from him). Fight well."""
Yuddha Kanda,97,6,"Hearing the words of Ravana, Mahodara the chief of demons saying ""So it be"", penetrated into the army of enemies, as a moth rushed into a flame."
Yuddha Kanda,97,7,"Emboldened by the words of his master, that mighty demon, with full of energy, destroyed the monkeys by dint of his own valour."
Yuddha Kanda,97,8,"Taking hold of huge rocks and penetrating the terrific army of enemies, those highly strong monkeys too started killing all the demons."
Yuddha Kanda,97,9,"In that great battle, the highly enraged Mahodara, with his arrows decked in gold, chopped off the hands, feet and thighs of monkeys."
Yuddha Kanda,97,10,"Then, among all those monkeys who were tormented by the demons, some ran away into ten directions. Some others sought refuge with Sugreeva."
Yuddha Kanda,97,11,"Seeing the large army of monkeys defeated in the battle, Sugreeva rushed towards Mahodara who was immediately close to him."
Yuddha Kanda,97,12,"Seizing hold of a large and terrific rock, which looked like a mountain, Sugreeva who was endowed with a great energy, hurled it with an aim to kill the demon."
Yuddha Kanda,97,13,"Seeing that rock falling suddenly, Mahodara, then unagitated, tore it with his arrows, though it was difficult to approach."
Yuddha Kanda,97,14,"That rock, broken to a thousand pieces by that demon with a multitude of his arrows, forthwith fell down on earth, like a flock of frightened vultures."
Yuddha Kanda,97,15,"Filled with rage on seeing that rock broken and uprooting a Sala tree, Sugreeva hurled it at his enemy and Mahodara chopped it off into many pieces."
Yuddha Kanda,97,16,"The valiant Mahodara, who was the tormentator of hostile forces, lacerated Sugreeva with his arrows. That enraged Sugreeva then saw an iron rod on the ground."
Yuddha Kanda,97,17,"Swinging that flashing iron rod and showing it to him, Sugreeva killed the excellent horses of Mahodara with that iron rod of terrible speed."
Yuddha Kanda,97,18,"Jumping down from that huge chariot, whose horses had been killed, that valiant Mahodara the demon, thereupon seized hold of a mace with anger."
Yuddha Kanda,97,19,"With a mace and an iron road respectively in their hands and roaring like two bulls and resembling like two clouds charged with lightning, those two heroes closed in for a battle."
Yuddha Kanda,97,20,"Mahodara the demon was angry with Sgureeva and thereupon hurled his blazing mace, which shone like the sun, on Sugreeva."
Yuddha Kanda,97,21,"Seeing that highly terrible mace, falling on him in that great battle, the mighty Sugreeva, the King of monkeys, was enraged with red eyes and struck that mace, by lifting up the iron rod. That iron rod broke off and fell on the ground."
Yuddha Kanda,97,22,"Thereupon, the spirited Sugreeva took hold of a formidable steel club, entirely decked with gold, from the earth-surface."
Yuddha Kanda,97,23,"Lifting that steel club, Sugreeva hurled it. Mahodara too hurled another mace on him. Those two weapons, clashing each other, broke and fell on the floor."
Yuddha Kanda,97,24,"As all their weapons were broken, those two warriors, who were endowed with spirit and strength, resembling two blazing fires, started contending with fists."
Yuddha Kanda,97,25,"Roaring again and again, those two warriors then banged each other. Slapping each other with their palms, they rolled on the earth's surface."
Yuddha Kanda,97,26,"They raised quickly on their feet and then began to strike each other. Remaining unyielded, the two heroes pushed each other on their shoulders."
Yuddha Kanda,97,27,"Those two heroes, the annihilators their enemies, felt exhausted in the course of their wrestling. Then the highly fast Mahodara the demon took hold of a sword and a shield, lying not very far."
Yuddha Kanda,97,28,"In the same way, the highly swift Sugreeva the foremost of monkeys took hold of a large sword together with a shield, lying there."
Yuddha Kanda,97,29,"Thereupon, those two warriors, who were skilled in the use of weaponry in the battle-field and whose limbs were seized with anger, galloped forward, roaring with joy, with their swords upraised."
Yuddha Kanda,97,30,"With their thoughts concentrated on one point of victory, both the warriors were enraged with each other and performed circumambulations form left to right, very quickly."
Yuddha Kanda,97,31,"That valiant and evil-minded Mahodara, who was boasting of his own prowess, let fall with very high speed, that sword on the heavy shield of Sugreeva."
Yuddha Kanda,97,32,"Even while Mahodara was extracting his sword which had got struck in the shield, Sugreeva severed with his own sword, Mahodara's head, which was adorned with ear-rings and helmet."
Yuddha Kanda,97,33,"While Mahodara, with his head chopped off, was falling on the ground, Ravana's army, on seeing it, could no longer be seen on the battle-field."
Yuddha Kanda,97,34,"Having killed Mahodara, Sugreeva made a rejoicing roar with his monkeys. Ravana was enraged. Rama looked rejoicing."
Yuddha Kanda,97,35,"With their faces looking low-spirited all the demons felt dejected. With their minds stricken with fear, all of them ran away from the battle-field."
Yuddha Kanda,97,36,"Having thrown down to the ground that Mahodara, looking like a part of a huge mountain lying shattered the invincible Sugreeva shone in glory in the battle-field like the sun shines with its rays."
Yuddha Kanda,97,37,"Having attained victory in the battle-front, Sugreeva then continued to be looked at by the multitude of gods, Siddhas (a class of demigods who are endowed with mystic powers) and Yakshas (another class of demigods attending on Kubera, the god of riches) as also a host of beings standing on the earth's surface who were all overwhelmed with joy."
Yuddha Kanda,98,1,"Seeing Mahodara killed by Sugreeva, the mighty Mahaparsva for his part with his red-blood eyes through anger, forthwith stirred up the terrific army of Angada with his arrows."
Yuddha Kanda,98,2,"That demon struck down the heads of monkey-chiefs from their trunks, as wind would throw down a fruit from its stalk."
Yuddha Kanda,98,3,"Moreover, that demon very quickly chopped off the arms of some monkeys with his arrows and struck down the region of the ribs of others."
Yuddha Kanda,98,4,"Tormented by the flight of arrows of Mahaparshva, all those monkeys were downcast with despair and lost heart."
Yuddha Kanda,98,5,"Seeing his army depressed on being tormented by the demon, Angada who was endowed with a great impetuosity, exhibited his tempo like an ocean on full-moon days."
Yuddha Kanda,98,6,"Taking hold of a steel rod, with its radiance equal to that of the sun, hurled it on Mahaparshva in that combat."
Yuddha Kanda,98,7,"By that blow, that Mahaparsva dropped senseless and unconscious on the ground from his chariot along with is charioteer"
Yuddha Kanda,98,8,"The energetic Jambavan, looking like a heap of black collyrium, who was exceedingly powerful, battalion which resembled a black cloud a mountain-peak, killed his horses with his strength and broke that chariot too."
Yuddha Kanda,98,9,"Regaining his consciousness within a while, the mighty Mahaparshva again struck Angada with his many arrows."
Yuddha Kanda,98,10,"He struck Jambavan, the king of bears with three arrows in his chest and struck Gavaksha too with many arrows."
Yuddha Kanda,98,11,"Seeing Gavaksha and Jambavan tormented by the arrows, that Angada was infatuated with anger and seized hold of a terrific iron rod."
Yuddha Kanda,98,12,"Firmly holding that iron rod, which shone like the rays of the sun, with both hands and turning it around with force, Angada son of Vali, his eyes red with anger, hurled it on that Mahaparshva the demon, who stood at a distance, with an intention to kill him."
Yuddha Kanda,98,13,"Hurled by the mighty Angada, that iron rod for its part, knocked the bow with the arrow fitted to it, from the demon's hand and also his helmet."
Yuddha Kanda,98,14,"Approaching him with speed and with anger, the valiant Angada slapped him on the temple (root of the ear), shining with an ear-ring."
Yuddha Kanda,98,15,"Enraged as he was, that Mahaparsva for his part, who was endowed with a great swiftness and enormous splendour, seized hold of a huge axe in one hand."
Yuddha Kanda,98,16,"Extremely enraged, the demon hurled that stainless and strong axe, which had been washed in oil and which was made of steel, on Angada."
Yuddha Kanda,98,17,"Full of anger, that Angada evaded that axe, which had been aimed by him mostly at his left shoulder-bone."
Yuddha Kanda,98,18,"That valiant Angada, with his prowess equal to that of his father, was quite enraged and firmly tightened his fist resembling a thunder-bolt."
Yuddha Kanda,98,19,"Knowing the vital parts of the body, Angada pounced his fist, which invaded like a thunderbolt, on the boson of the demon, in the vicinity of his breasts."
Yuddha Kanda,98,20,"With the blow of that fist in that great combat, the fleshy part of his heart was blasted and he fell dead on the ground."
Yuddha Kanda,98,21,"When Mahaparshva fell dead on the ground, his army got confused. A mammoth anger arose in Ravana."
Yuddha Kanda,98,22,"That highly profound lion's roar of the rejoiced monkeys, by its noise, was well like the loud sound of the gods along with Indra the lord celestials, nay, by its vibrations breaking asunder as it were the City of Lanka with its attics and town-gates."
Yuddha Kanda,98,23,"Hearing the loud noise of monkeys, as also of the celestials in the battle-field, the enraged Ravana the adversary of Indra, then stood prepared for a battle again."
Yuddha Kanda,99,1,"Seeing Mahodara and Mahaparshva the demons having been killed, and that valiant and mighty Virupaksha struck down in that great battle, a tremendous anger took possession of Ravana. He urged on his charioteer and addressed to him the following words:"
Yuddha Kanda,99,2,"""Killing those two princes, Rama and Lakshmana, I will remove surely the sorrow caused to me on account of the ministers who have been killed and the city which has been laid siege to (by the monkeys)."""
Yuddha Kanda,99,3,"""In the battle, I will cut down the tree in the shape of Rama, which is going to yield fruit through its flower in the form of Seetha, whose principal branches are Sugreeva, Jambavan, Kumuda, Nala, Dvivida, Mainda, Angada, Gandhamadana, Hanuma, Sushena and all the chiefs of monkey-warriors."""
Yuddha Kanda,99,4,"Ravana, the mighty and the surpassing Chariot-Warrior, went quickly, making a noise in all the ten directions, with the sound of the chariot, rushing towards Rama."
Yuddha Kanda,99,5,"Filled with that sound, the entire earth, with its rivers, mountains and forests, trembled, throwing lions, antelopes and birds, into fright."
Yuddha Kanda,99,6,"He employed very highly terrific and exceedingly frightful mystic missile called Tamasa, which began to consume all the monkeys, who started falling down on all sides."
Yuddha Kanda,99,7,"Dust began to fly up from the earth, while those frustrated monkeys were fleeing away for they could no longer bear that missile built by Brahma himself."
Yuddha Kanda,99,8,"Seeing those hundreds of many of his armies shattered by excellent arrows of Ravana, Rama took his stand, ready for the battle."
Yuddha Kanda,99,9,"Having driven away the army of monkeys, Ravana the foremost among the demons then saw Rama, the annihilator of his enemies, who was endowed with long arms and eyes as wide as lotus petals standing unconquered with his brother Lakshmana-like Indra the lord of celestials is seen with Vishnu, the supreme lord of preservation-holding up his great bow as though scraping the sky."
Yuddha Kanda,99,10,"Seeing the disappointed monkeys and Ravana advancing, the mighty Rama who was endowed with a great splendour and accompanied by Lakshmana who were born in Raghu dynasty, then pleasingly seized his bow at the middle."
Yuddha Kanda,99,11,"Thereupon, Rama began to stretch his excellent bow, which was endowed with great force and sonorous, as though he was breaking the earth asunder."
Yuddha Kanda,99,12,"Then, due to that buzzing sound produced by the streams of Ravana's arrows as also by the twang of Rama's bow, those demons fell down in their hundreds."
Yuddha Kanda,99,13,"That Ravana, coming within the range of arrow-shots of Rama and Lakshmana, resembled Rahu (the demon who is supposed to seize the sun and the moon), standing in the vicinity of the moon and the sun."
Yuddha Kanda,99,14,"Wishing to fight him with his sharp arrows at the earliest, Lakshmana stretching his bow, released his arrows which were like flames of fire."
Yuddha Kanda,99,15,"Ravana of extra ordinary energy prevented those arrows, the moment they were released by Lakshmana, with his arrows, in the sky itself."
Yuddha Kanda,99,16,"Showing the dexterity of his hand, Ravana split the arrows of Lakshmana one with one, three with three and ten with ten arrows."
Yuddha Kanda,99,17,"Overpassing Lakshmana, Ravana the victorious in battle, approached Rama, who stood like another mountain, in the battle-field."
Yuddha Kanda,99,18,"Having approached Rama, Ravana the lord of demons, having his eyes turning red-blood through anger, released streams of arrows upon him."
Yuddha Kanda,99,19,"Just on seeing streams of arrows coming forth, loosed from Ravana's bow, Rama thereupon quickly seized hold of 'Bhalla'* arrows in haste."
Yuddha Kanda,99,20,"Then, Rama tore off that multitude of arrows, which were blazing and looking very terrific like enraged serpents, with his sharp Bhalla - arrows."
Yuddha Kanda,99,21,"Rama on Ravana and Ravana on Rama, quickly showered each other with streams of sharp-pointed arrows of various kinds."
Yuddha Kanda,99,22,"Pushing back each other with the velocity of their arrows and remaining undefeated, the two warriors described circles of different kinds each moving from left to right, for a long time."
Yuddha Kanda,99,23,"Created beings were frightened, even as both the terrific warriors were fighting all at once, releasing their arrows at each other, thus resembling the god of retribution and the god of Death respectively."
Yuddha Kanda,99,24,"The sky at that time became dense with arrows of various kinds, even as it is covered, at the end of the monsoon, with clouds crowded with crowns of lightning."
Yuddha Kanda,99,25,"The sky was studded as with eye-holes, by showers of arrows of high velocity, which were extremely sharp-pointed and adorned with plumes of vultures and were loosed with high speed."
Yuddha Kanda,99,26,"They initially made the sky dark with arrows. Even after the sun-set, they made it dark, like two huge clouds risen in it."
Yuddha Kanda,99,27,"A great combat ensued between both of them, who were willing to kill each other. That battle was unimaginable and unapproachable, like the duel that took place between Vritra the demon and Indra the lord of celestials."
Yuddha Kanda,99,28,Both the warriors were excellent archers. Both were skilled in war-fare. Both were eminently skilled in the use of missiles. Both moved unhindered in the battle-field.
Yuddha Kanda,99,29,"In whichever course both of them went, in the same respective direction, streams of arrows went, like waves in two oceans, whipped by the wind."
Yuddha Kanda,99,30,"Ravana, having skilful hands and a cause for the cry of the world, released a row of steel arrows on Rama's forehead."
Yuddha Kanda,99,31,"Rama endured on his head, that row of steel arrows, having a lustre of black lotus-petals, discharged from the terrific bow. He did not get perturbed."
Yuddha Kanda,99,32,"Thereupon, seizing hold of more arrows, reciting sacred incantations and making use of the missile presided over by Rudra and stretching his bow, the valiant Rama of great splendour was filled with anger and released those arrows."
Yuddha Kanda,99,33,"Fallen on the unbreakable armour of Ravana, which looked like a large cloud, those arrows could not cause any pain to him at that time."
Yuddha Kanda,99,34,"Rama, who was skilled in the use of all types of mystic missiles, forthwith pierced in the forehead, yet again by a paramount missile, that Ravana seated in his chariot."
Yuddha Kanda,99,35,"Having pierced the frames of arrows of Ravana, Rama's arrows penetrated like five-headed hissing serpents into the earth, when rebuffed by Ravana."
Yuddha Kanda,99,36,"Striking down Rama's missile, that Ravana, who was stupefied with anger, employed another exceedingly terrific missile presided over by demoniac forces."
Yuddha Kanda,99,37,"He released sharp arrows, having the heads of lions and tigers, those of buzzards and crows, even of vultures and faloons, as well as those of jackals and wolves, arrows with their mouths wide open, having the heads of venomous snakes with five heads, bringing fear."
Yuddha Kanda,99,38,"Hissing like a serpent provoked to anger Ravana who was endowed with extraordinary energy and conjuring tricks, released towards Rama these and other arrows, having the heads of donkeys, those of boars, dogs and cocks as also of alligators and venomous snakes."
Yuddha Kanda,99,39,"Possessed by a missile presided over by demoniac forces, that Rama endowed with a great strength and resembling the god of fire, released a missile presided over by the god of fire."
Yuddha Kanda,99,40,"Rama employed there, various kinds of arrows, with heads bright as fire, others with heads shining like the sun, the moon, the crescent, a comet, others shining like planets, lunar mansions and a huge meteor and some arrows resembling flashes of lightning."
Yuddha Kanda,99,41,"Struck by Rama's missile, the terrific arrows of Ravana got destroyed in the sky and fell down in thousands of pieces."
Yuddha Kanda,99,42,"Rejoiced to see that missile struck down by Rama, who was unweary in action, all the valiant monkeys, who were capable of changing their form at will, then encompassing Rama, raised a clamour, facing Sugreeva."
Yuddha Kanda,99,43,"Striking down with force that missile which came forth from Ravana's arms, the great-souled Rama, then was filled with rejoice while the chiefs of monkeys, full f joy, shouted loudly."
Yuddha Kanda,100,1,"When that missile was made defunct, Ravana the king of demons, for his part, doubled his fury and in his anger, began to employ another missile immediately."
Yuddha Kanda,100,2,"Ravana, who was endowed with extraordinary splendour, started to release another cruel and terrific missile built by Maya the demon, on Rama."
Yuddha Kanda,100,3,"Then, from that bow, came forth, blazing pikes, maces and clubs, which were hard as adamant, on all sides."
Yuddha Kanda,100,4,"Various kinds of furious mallets, deceptive nooses and blazing thunderbolts came forth, like piercing gales at the time of the destruction of the world."
Yuddha Kanda,100,5,"The glorious Rama, the foremost among the knower in the use of excellent missiles and who was endowed with extra ordinary splendour, struck down that missile with an excellent missile presided over by Gandharvas the celestial musicians."
Yuddha Kanda,100,6,"When that missile was made defunct by the great souled Rama, Ravana with his coppery eyes in anger, employed a missile presided over by the sun-god."
Yuddha Kanda,100,7,"Then came forth resplendent and large discuses, from the bow of that intelligent Ravana, of terrific impetuosity."
Yuddha Kanda,100,8,"Even as they came forth and falling on all sides, the sky was blazing and the quarters illuminated, as by the moon, the sun and other planets."
Yuddha Kanda,100,9,"In the forefront of Ravana's army, that Rama split those discuses and other strange weapons, with a multitude of arrows."
Yuddha Kanda,100,10,"Seeing that missile struck down, Ravana the king of demons, for his part, pierced Rama with ten arrows in all his vital parts."
Yuddha Kanda,100,11,"Eventhough that Ravana struck Rama with those ten arrows released from his great bow, Rama of extraordinary energy was not shaken."
Yuddha Kanda,100,12,"Then, Rama the victorious in battle, was quite enraged and struck Ravana in all his organs with a multitude of arrows."
Yuddha Kanda,100,13,"In the meantime, the mighty and enraged Lakshmana, Rama's younger brother, the destroyer of valiant enemies, seized hold of seven arrows."
Yuddha Kanda,100,14,"Lakshmana of great brilliance, with those arrows of high velocity, tore off into many pieces, the flag-staff of Ravana, which bore the emblem of a man's head."
Yuddha Kanda,100,15,"The glorious and mighty Lakshmana, with a single arrow, tore the head of Ravana's charioteer, which was adorned with blazing ear-rings."
Yuddha Kanda,100,16,"With five sharp arrows, Lakshmana then chopped off Ravana's bow, which looked like an elephant's trunk."
Yuddha Kanda,100,17,"Bouncing forward, Vibhishana killed, with his mace, the excellent horses of Ravana, which looked like black clouds and were tall as mountains."
Yuddha Kanda,100,18,"Leaping down with speed from his large chariot, whose horses had been killed, Ravana then exhibited a violent anger towards the younger brother of Rama."
Yuddha Kanda,100,19,"Then, Ravana, of great energy and prowess, hurled a spear looking like a blazing thunderbolt, on Vibhishana."
Yuddha Kanda,100,20,"Even before the spear reached Vibhishana, Lakshmana tore it with three of his arrows and a loud cheer then arose from the monkeys in the battle-field."
Yuddha Kanda,100,21,"That gold-crowned spear, torn into three pieces, fell like a large meteor with sparks of fire falling from the sky."
Yuddha Kanda,100,22,"Thereupon, Ravana took hold of another large most competent spear, which was difficult to be approached even by Yama the lord of Death and blazing as it was, with its own splendour."
Yuddha Kanda,100,23,"The mighty and the evil-minded Ravana swiftly hurled that very great spear, burning with a radiance similar to that of a blazing thunder-bolt."
Yuddha Kanda,100,24,"In the meanwhile, the valiant Lakshmana quickly rushed towards that Vibhishana, who got a danger to his life."
Yuddha Kanda,100,25,"To rescue that Vibhishana, the heroic Lakshmana, having stretched his bow, threw out streams of arrows on Ravana who was holding a spear in his hand."
Yuddha Kanda,100,26,"Poured in with a multitude of arrows discharged by the great-souled Lakshmana, Ravana with his attach frustrated, did not make up his mind to attack Vibhishana further."
Yuddha Kanda,100,27,"Seeing Vibhishana his brother rescued by Lakshmana, that Ravana, turning his face towards Lakshmana spoke the following words:"
Yuddha Kanda,100,28,"""O Lakshmana, exalter of your own strength! As Vibhishana was rescued by you in this way, this spear, on letting off Vibhishana the demon, is being hurled on you now."""
Yuddha Kanda,100,29,"""This spear, having blood-marks and hurled by bludgeon-like arm, having pierced your heart, will depart only after taking your life."""
Yuddha Kanda,100,30,"Thus saying, the greatly enraged Ravana roared and hurled towards Lakshmana, that unfailing spear, which was adorned with eight loudly clamouring bells, which had been designed by Maya the demon by dint of his conjuring trick, capable of destroying adversaries and blazing as it was with splendour."
Yuddha Kanda,100,31,"That spear, with a sound equal to Indra's thunder-bolt, hurled by the terribly swift Ravana, soon fell with speed on Lakshmana in the battle-front."
Yuddha Kanda,100,32,"Rama repeatedly uttered to that spear even as it was rushing forth (on Lakshmana) as follows: ""May it be well with Lakshmana! May you prove useless! May your effort be frustrated!"""
Yuddha Kanda,100,33,"That spear, which was looking like a venomous serpent, released by the enraged Ravana in the battle, quickly penetrated the bosom of Lakshmana, who stood fearless."
Yuddha Kanda,100,34,"That spear, like the tongue of Vasuki (the lord of serpents), blazing with a great dazzle, fell on the broad chest of Lakshmana, with enormous speed."
Yuddha Kanda,100,35,"Penetrated very deeply and pierced through his heart by the spear due to the force exerted by Ravana, Lakshmana fell to the ground."
Yuddha Kanda,100,36,"Seeing Lakshmana in that state, Rama, of extraordinary splendour, who was stationed in the vicinity, became sorrowful at heart because of the love towards his brother."
Yuddha Kanda,100,37,"Rama, whose eyes were filled with tears, reflected just for a while and then was very much enraged, like fire at the time of dissolution of the world."
Yuddha Kanda,100,38,"Becoming aware that it was not the time for feeling despondent, and looking at Lakshmana, Rama resumed that highly tumultuous battle with a great and whole-hearted endeavour, determined as he was to destroy Ravana."
Yuddha Kanda,100,39,"Then, Rama saw Lakshmana, who was struck by the spear in that Great War, bathed as he was in blood and looking like a mountain with a snake (entering its centre)."
Yuddha Kanda,100,40,"Even with an exertion to pull out that spear hurled by the mighty Ravana, those foremost of the monkeys could not those foremost of the monkeys could not do it because they were being tormented by Ravana the foremost of demons with a stream of his arrows."
Yuddha Kanda,100,41,"Penetrating through Lakshmana's bosom, that spear touched the earth. Seizing hold of awful spear with his hands, the mighty Rama drew it out and getting enraged, broke it during the course of the battle."
Yuddha Kanda,100,42,"While Rama was drawing the spear out; arrow, which pierced his vital organs, were sunk by the mighty Ravana on all his limbs."
Yuddha Kanda,100,43,"Ignoring those arrows and having embraced Lakshmana, Rama spoke to Hanuma and Sugreeva, the king of monkeys, as follows:"
Yuddha Kanda,100,44,"""O the chiefs of monkeys! Remain just encompassing Lakshmana. Let this malicious Ravana of evil designs be killed. The time to manifest my prowess, which I have been wishing for long, has come, as for a chataka bird, the site of a cloud would come, as sought by it, at the end of a hot season."""
Yuddha Kanda,100,45,"""I take this vow in truth before you, at this moment, O monkeys, that without delay, you will see the world devoid of Ravana or Rama (myself)."""
Yuddha Kanda,100,46,"""I encountered with the loss of sovereignity, the dwelling in the forest, the wandering around in the woods of Dandaka and the rough treatment of Seetha by the demons."""
Yuddha Kanda,100,47,"""A great and terrible suffering has happened to me and an agony equivalent to hell. Now, by killing Ravana in battle, I will relieve myself of all that agony."""
Yuddha Kanda,100,48,"""That sinful demon, for whose sake, this army of monkeys has been brought by me, Sugreeva has been anointed on the throne after killing Vali and for whose sake the ocean has been crossed and a bridge built on it, has come within the range of my sight in the battle-field now."""
Yuddha Kanda,100,49,"""This Ravana, having come within the range of my vision, cannot survive, any more than the one who has come within the range of vision of a snake injecting deadly poison with its very glance or than a serpent who has come within the range of vision of Garuda, the king of birds and the enemy of serpents."""
Yuddha Kanda,100,50,"""O the foremost of the monkeys who are so difficult to conquer! Seated on the mountain-peaks, you witness at ease, this battle between myself and Ravana."""
Yuddha Kanda,100,51,"""Let the three worlds (viz. the earth, heaven and the intermediate region) including Gandharvas the celestial musicians, the gods, the sages and the celestial bards see today the Ramahood of Rama during the course of my battle."""
Yuddha Kanda,100,52,"""I shall perform today a feat, which people in the world including all living beings both mobile and immobile, as also gods, will ever narrate together, describing how the battle proceeded, as long as the earth is able to support those who occupy it."""
Yuddha Kanda,100,53,"Thus speaking, Rama with an attentive mind in the battle-field, struck Rama with sharp arrows, decked in pure gold."
Yuddha Kanda,100,54,"Thereupon, Ravana streamed forth blazing steel arrows and then clubs, as clouds would stream forth the rains."
Yuddha Kanda,100,55,"A tumultuous sound arose from the excellent arrows, released by Rama and Ravana, as they struck each other."
Yuddha Kanda,100,56,"The arrows of Rama and Ravana, split asunder and scattered off, with their blazing points, fell from the space on to the surface of the earth."
Yuddha Kanda,100,57,"The loud sound, produced by the impact of the bow-string on the palms of those two heroes Rama and Ravana, which struck terror in all the living beings, was felt astonished by the audience."
Yuddha Kanda,100,58,"Torn asunder by the streams of a multitude of arrows by the great-souled Rama, who was armed with a blazing bow, while coming in collusion with him, Ravana took to his heels out of fear, like a cloud when pushed by a tempest."
Yuddha Kanda,101,1,"Seeing the valiant Lakshmana bathed in a stream of blood, when struck down in battle with a spear by the mighty Ravana and having given a tumultuous fight, to the evil-minded Ravana, Rama spoke as follows to Sushena, even while releasing a multitude of arrows (at Ravana)."
Yuddha Kanda,101,2,"""This heroic Lakshmana, falling down on earth yielding to Ravana's prowess, is wiggling like a serpent, causing an increase in grief to me."""
Yuddha Kanda,101,3,"""My energy to fight is failing, even as I see this valiant Lakshmana, who is dearer to me than life, bathed in blood, my mind being greatly disturbed."""
Yuddha Kanda,101,4,"""Of what use is life or happiness to me, if this illustrious brother of mine, who is endowed with auspicious bodily marks and who always speaks highly of war, meets with his death?"""
Yuddha Kanda,101,5,"""My valour is feeling shy, as it were. My bow seems to fall down from any hand. My arrows are dropping down. My vision has been overcome with tears."""
Yuddha Kanda,101,6,"""My limbs seem to sink down, like those of men in sleep. I have a serious tension, growing in me. I even wish to die."""
Yuddha Kanda,101,7,"""My brother has been struck down by the evil-minded Ravana, seriously wounded in his vital parts, afflicted with agony and groaming."""
Yuddha Kanda,101,8,"Seeing his beloved brother, who was his very life-breath moving outside, Rama was afflicted with excessive agony and gave himself up to anxiety and grief."
Yuddha Kanda,101,9,"Seeing Lakshmana his brother lying wounded in the dust of the battle-field, he got into extreme despondency and lamented (as follows), confused in mind, as he was:"
Yuddha Kanda,101,10,"""O the valiant Lakshmana! Even victory cannot create a pleasure for me. What pleasure can the moon create for a man who has lost his vision?"""
Yuddha Kanda,101,11,"""What purpose of mine will be served by fighting or eve by life? When this Lakshmana lies killed in the forefront of battle here, I have no use for the war."""
Yuddha Kanda,101,12,"""In the same way as the very glorious Lakshmana followed me When I was going to the forest, I too will in the same way follow him to the abode of Yama the lord of Death."""
Yuddha Kanda,101,13,"""The demons, who fight treacherously, created this condition to Lakshmana, who loved his relatives and who was ardently devoted forever to me."""
Yuddha Kanda,101,14,"""Wives may be obtained ever where. Relatives can be had every where. However, I do not find a brother, born of the same womb, at such a place whatesoever."""
Yuddha Kanda,101,15,"The monkeys saw that Rama, thus lamenting with his mind reeling and distressed in grief and pitiably sighing his breath repeatedly."
Yuddha Kanda,101,16,"""Of what use is the kingdom for me, without Lakshmana, who was difficult to over power? What can I tell to Sumitra, the mother who was so fond of her son?"""
Yuddha Kanda,101,17,"""I shall not be able to bear the reproach, which will be levelled by Sumitra. What shall I pay to kausalya the mother or what shall I say to Kaikeya?"""
Yuddha Kanda,101,18,"""What shall I say to Bharata or to the mighty Shatrughna, when they ask me, how I came back without Lakshmana even though I went to the forest along with him?"""
Yuddha Kanda,101,19,"""It is better to die at this place only, rather than hear the reproaches of one's own people. What sinful act was done by me in a previous birth due to which my righteous brother lies killed before me?"
Yuddha Kanda,101,20,"""Alas! O the powerful brother, the best of men! O the foremost among the valiant men! Why are you going to the other world, deserting me?"""
Yuddha Kanda,101,21,"""O brother! Why don't you talk to me, even though I am lamenting? Rise and see! Why are you lying down? See me, by opening your own eyes, miserable as I am."""
Yuddha Kanda,101,22,"""O the mighty armed! You have been indeed comforting me, whenever stricken with grief, I roamed listlessly among mountains and forests or felt low-spirited."""
Yuddha Kanda,101,23,"Comforting Rama, whose mind was full of grief and who was thus lamenting, Sushena, for his part, addressed the following excellent words:"
Yuddha Kanda,101,24,"""O the excellent among men! Give up this notion, which causes despondency in you, this anguish which gives rise to grief and is as piercing as arrows, in the forefront of battle."""

Yuddha Kanda,101,28,"""The repeatedly beating heart with the signs of breath of Lakshmana, lying on the earth's surface, fast asleep, with his limbs relaxed are telling it, O the gallant prince!"""
Yuddha Kanda,101,29,"Having addressed the words thus to Rama, the highly learned Sushena spoke the following words to Hanuma the great monkey, who was standing nearby:"
Yuddha Kanda,101,30,"""Proceeding from this place with full speed, O gentle one!, to the mountain called Oushadhi (Mahodaya), which was already described to you previously by Jambavan, O brave one! Bring here for restoring the great-souled and heroic Lakshmana to consciousness, the precious herb Vishalyakarani (1) by name which was sprung up on its southern peak, Savarnakarnani (2), Samjivakarani(3) and the precious herb, Samdhanakarani (4)."""
Yuddha Kanda,101,31,"Hearing those words, Hanuma, having sprung to Mount Oushadhi, could not identify those precious herbs and became thoughtful."
Yuddha Kanda,101,32,"The following thought arose to that Hanuma, whose strength was unlimited: ""I will go back, taking this mountain-peak itself."""
Yuddha Kanda,101,33,"""By conjecture, I understand that the delightful herb must have sprouted in this mountain-peak. Sushena indeed has said so."""
Yuddha Kanda,101,34,"""If I go without taking Vishalyakarani, harm may come through passage of time and a great perplexity may arise."""
Yuddha Kanda,101,35,"Thinking thus, the mighty Hanuma the excellent of monkeys, having gone quickly and approaching that excellent mountain, taking that mountain-peak with his arms, shaking it violently for three times and uprooting the mountain-peak, which was endowed with many trees in bloom, lifted it up, so mighty as he was."
Yuddha Kanda,101,36,"Taking that mountain-peak, which looked like a dark rainy cloud, that Hanuman jumped up into the sky."
Yuddha Kanda,101,37,"Arriving with a great speed, Hanuma putting down the mountain-peak and resting for a while, spoke the following words to Sushena:"
Yuddha Kanda,101,38,"""O the excellent of monkeys! I have brought the entire mountain-peak, as I could not identify those herbs."""
Yuddha Kanda,101,39,"Eulogizing Hanuma, who was thus narrating his trip, Sushena, the excellent of monkeys, pulling out the herbs, took hold off them."
Yuddha Kanda,101,40,All those monkey-chiefs and even the gods were surprised to see that most difficult feat of Hanuma.
Yuddha Kanda,101,41,"Then, crushign that herb, Sushena the excellent of monkeys, having a great splendour, administered it through Lakshmana's nose."
Yuddha Kanda,101,42,"Duly inhaling it well, that Lakshmana, the annihilator of adversaries, having the spear lodged in his body, raised quickly from the earth's surface rid as he was of the spear and his pain."
Yuddha Kanda,101,43,"Seeing that Lakshmana risen from the ground, the mokneys were overjoyed and applauded Lakshmana, saying, ""Excellent, excellent!""."
Yuddha Kanda,101,44,"Rama, the destroyer of enemies, said to Lakshmana, ""come, come!"" and embraced him firmly with affection, with his eyes clouded with tears."
Yuddha Kanda,101,45,"After embracing Lakshmana, Rama then said to him: ""Luckily, O valiant one, I see you here, returned from death."""
Yuddha Kanda,101,46,"""There is no purpose of mine, by me own life nor of Seetha nor of victory. If you have attained demise, tell me what significnace is there for it to me?"""
Yuddha Kanda,101,47,"While the great souled Rama was speaking thus, the exhausted Lakshmana, in a feeble tone, spoke the following words:"
Yuddha Kanda,101,48,"""Having solemnly taken that pledge (of killing Ravana) before, O brother true to your promise, you ought not to speak as you have done like a weak and courageless man."""

Yuddha Kanda,101,53,"""O venerable hero! If you wish to kill Ravana in battle, if you wish to fulfill your promise and if you feel affectionate towards Seetha, do as I tell you soon and now."""
Yuddha Kanda,102,1,"Hearing those words of Lakshmana, that valiant Rama, the annihilator of his enemies, taking hold of his bow, fixed an arrow on the bow-string."
Yuddha Kanda,102,2,"In the forefront of battle, Rama released terrific arrows towards Ravana. Then, occupying another chariot, Ravana the king of demons rushed towards Rama, even as Rahu the seizer-demon rushes towards the sun."
Yuddha Kanda,102,3,"Ravana for his part, standing in his chariot struck Rama with thunderbolt-like arrows, as a cloud strikes gushes of rain on a huge mountain."
Yuddha Kanda,102,4,"With an attentive mind, Rama showered golden decked arrows, looking like blazing flames of fire, on Ravana in the battle-field."
Yuddha Kanda,102,5,"The gods, celestial musicians and kinnaras the mythical beings thought that the battle was not equal between Rama standing on the ground and Ravana fighting from a chariot."
Yuddha Kanda,102,6,"Hearing their nectar-like words, the illustrious Indra, the chief f celestials then called Matali and spoke as follows:"
Yuddha Kanda,102,7,"""Go quickly with my chariot to Rama, who is standing on the earth. After reaching the earth, invite him to take his seat in the chariot and carry out a great service to the gods."""
Yuddha Kanda,102,8,"Hearing the words of Indra, Matali, the charioteer of Indra, offering salutation to him by bowing his head, spoke then the following words:"
Yuddha Kanda,102,9,"""O Indra! Providing with green horses the excellent chariot, I will proceed then immediately and perform the duty of a charioteer to Rama."""
Yuddha Kanda,102,10,"Then came the glorious and excellent chariot of Indra, having variegated body decked in gold, which was fitted with hundreds of tiny bells, with its pole of cat's eye gems shone like the morning sun, yoked to excellent green horses, having golden chaplets on their heads, having white whisks, covered with nets of gold, shining like the sun and bearing a flag-staff raised on a golden bamboo. Ascending the chariot, as enjoined by Indra and descending from paradise, Matali approached Rama."
Yuddha Kanda,102,11,"Then Matali, the charioteer of Indra, along with a whip in his hand, stayed in the chariot itself and joining his palms in salutation, spoke the following words to Rama."
Yuddha Kanda,102,12,"""Indra has sent this chariot to you for your victory, O the mighty and the glorious Rama, the destroyer of adversaries!"""
Yuddha Kanda,102,13,"""Here is the great bow belonging to Indra, an armour shining as fire, some arrows as bright as sun and a stainless auspicious spear."""
Yuddha Kanda,102,14,"""O heroic king! Mounting this chariot with me as a charioteer, kill Ravana the king, as earlier Indra the lord of celestials killed the demons."""
Yuddha Kanda,102,15,"Duly circumambulating that chariot (as a mark of respect) and offering his salutation, when thus spoken by Matali, Rama then ascended the chariot, causing the three worlds to shine forth with his splendour."
Yuddha Kanda,102,16,"Then ensued a tumultuous and thrilling battle, between the great armed Rama and Ravana, the demon."
Yuddha Kanda,102,17,"That Rama, who was skilled in the use of great missiles, struck the missile presided over by Gandharvas and the missile presided over by gods, by means of missiles of the same type."
Yuddha Kanda,102,18,"Ravana, the king of demons was very much enraged and again released another extra-ordinarily terrific missile presided over by demons."
Yuddha Kanda,102,19,"Those arrows, decked with gold, discharged from Ravana's bow, turning as they were into highly poisonous snakes and rolled towards Rama."
Yuddha Kanda,102,20,"With flaming mouths wide open and vomiting blazing fire, those dreadful snake-like arrows dashed towards Rama alone."
Yuddha Kanda,102,21,"All the quarters stood covered by highly poisonous serpents, whose impact was as hard as that of Vasuki (the king of serpents), with the flaming coils. Even the corners between the quarters stood enveloped by them."
Yuddha Kanda,102,22,"Seeing those serpents rushing towards him in the battle-field, Rama released the terrific and dangerous missile presided over by Garuda the eagle (an enemy of serpents)."
Yuddha Kanda,102,23,"With golden shafts which shone like flames, discharged by Rama's bow turning into golden eagles (the enemies of serpents) those arrows flew all around."
Yuddha Kanda,102,24,"Those arrows of Rama, which can assume any form at will, appeared in the form of eagles and destroyed all those arrows, which flew with a great speed in the form of snakes."
Yuddha Kanda,102,25,"Enraged on his missile having been frustrated by Rama, Ravana streamed forth terrific showers of arrows on Rama."
Yuddha Kanda,102,26,"Tormenting Rama of unwearied action with thousand arrows, Ravana then pierced Matali with a multitude of arrows."
Yuddha Kanda,102,27,"Targeting with only one arrow, Ravana tore off the flag-staff. Striking down the golden flag-staff from the top of the chariot down to the seat of the chariot, Ravana struck even Indra's horses with a multitude of arrows."
Yuddha Kanda,102,28,"Seeing Rama afflicted, the gods, Gandharvas the celestial musicians, Charanas the celestials bards along with the demons, as also Siddhas the demi-gods and the great sages felt dejected. Seeing the moon in the shape of Rama eclipsed by Rahu in the shape of Ravana, the monkey-chiefs too, along with Vibhishana, felt perturbed."
Yuddha Kanda,102,29,"Seeing thus the moon in the shape of Rama eclipsed by the planet Rahu in the shape of Ravana, the planet Mercury stood, assailing the constellation Rohini presided over by the god Prajapati (the lord of creation), the beloved of the moon the heavenly body and spelling disaster to all created beings."
Yuddha Kanda,102,30,"Blazing as it were in fury, the ocean rose high at that time, as though it was going to touch the sun, its mist-wreathed waves moving to-and-fro."
Yuddha Kanda,102,31,"The sun, looking ashy in colour assuming a piercing aspect, and its rays grown exhilarated, appeared in a headless trunk in its lap and united with a comet."
Yuddha Kanda,102,32,"The planet Mars stood assailing in the sky, the constellation Vishakha, presided over by the gods Indra and Agni (the god of fire), which is adorned by the kings of Kosala."
Yuddha Kanda,102,33,"That Ravana, having ten faces and twenty arms, holding a bow tightly in his hands, looked like Mount Mainaka."
Yuddha Kanda,102,34,"Being overwhelmed by Ravana the demon in the battle-front, Rama could not fit his arrows to his bow."
Yuddha Kanda,102,35,"The enraged Rama, knitting his eye-brows and with his eyes turned slightly blood-red, was provoked to fierce anger, as though he would burn out the demons."
Yuddha Kanda,102,36,"Seeing the face of the sagacious Rama getting provoked of anger, all the living beings got frightened. The earth too began to tremble."
Yuddha Kanda,102,37,"The mountain, with lions, tigers and swaying trees, was trembled. Even the ocean, the lord of rivers, became agitated."
Yuddha Kanda,102,38,"Dense clouds, emitting harsh sounds and assuming a stern aspect, roamed all over in the sky, thundering."
Yuddha Kanda,102,39,"Seeing the very much enraged Rama and also the terrific portents, all the living beings were frightened. Fear seized Ravana too."
Yuddha Kanda,102,40,"Seated in their aerial cars, gods, Gandharvas the celestial musicians, great Nagas (semi divine beings having the face of a man and the tail of a serpent), the sages, demons, giants and those eagles remaining in the air, saw then the battle of two heroes, fighting steadily with various dreadful weapons and looking like the final dissolution of the world."
Yuddha Kanda,102,41,"Getting rejoiced on observing that great battle, all the gods and demons who had come to witness the conflict at that time, responded:"
Yuddha Kanda,102,42,"The demons who reached there cried out to Ravana, ""Be victorious!"". Those gods called to Rama saying again and again: ""Be you victorious!""."
Yuddha Kanda,102,43,"In the meantime, that evil-minded Ravana, who caused enemies to cry, stroking with anger a great weapon wishing to strike Rama, took hold off with fury, a spike, which was powerful as a thunderbolt, which made a loud noise (when hurled at a target), capable of exterminating all enemies, resembling the mountain-peaks, which with its sharp points dreadful to conceive and to behold, resembling a smoke-crested mass of fire blazing at the end of the world-cycle, exceedingly furious, which was difficult to approach even for Death, which was unassailable, which was a terror for all beings, capable as it was of tearing and splitting them and blazing as it was."
Yuddha Kanda,102,44,"That valiant Ravana, surrounded by warriors of demons in battle, was very much enraged and took hold of that spear at its middle."
Yuddha Kanda,102,45,"With blood-red eyes in anger, Ravana with his collossal body, duly raising the spear and bringing rejoice to his own army, roared terribly in battle."
Yuddha Kanda,102,46,"The terrific noise made by Ravana then trembled the earth, the sky, the four quarters and the angles of the compass"
Yuddha Kanda,102,47,"By that roar of that evil-minded Ravana of a collossal body, all the living beings were frightened. The ocean too got agitated."
Yuddha Kanda,102,48,"Taking hold of that large spear, that Ravana of great prowess, emitting a very loud roar, spoke the following harsh words to Rama:"
Yuddha Kanda,102,49,"""Raised in fury by me, O Rama! This spear with the power of a thunder-bolt, will take away surely your life along with the life of your bother, your help-mate."""
Yuddha Kanda,102,50,"""Killing you with my strength now, I, who always commend war-fare, will make you level with the valiant demons, who have been killed in the battle-front."""
Yuddha Kanda,102,51,"""Wait, I will kill you with the spear now, O Rama!"" Saying so, that demon hurled that spear."
Yuddha Kanda,102,52,"That spear, wreathed as it was in a circle of lightning, provided as it was with eight bells and making a loud noise, released from Ravana's hand, splashed, as it went into tehs sky."
Yuddha Kanda,102,53,"Seeing that blazing spear of terrible appearance, the valiant Rama who was born in Raghu dynasty, having stretched his bow, released the arrows."
Yuddha Kanda,102,54,"With streams of arrows, Rama warded off that spear, which was rushing upon him, as with streams of water, Indra the lord of celestials warded off the fire shooting up at the time of dissolution of the world."
Yuddha Kanda,102,55,"That large spear of Ravana consumed those arrows coming forth from Rama's bow, as fire would consume the moths."
Yuddha Kanda,102,56,"Seeing those arrows smashed by coming into contact with the spear and reduced to ashes even while positioned in the sky, Rama was seized with fury."
Yuddha Kanda,102,57,"That Rama, the delight of Raghus, was quite enraged and took hold of that spear brought by Matali the charioteer, as desired by Indra the lord of celestials."
Yuddha Kanda,102,58,"That spear, lifted up by the powerful Rama, which was rendered resonated by the bells, began to blaze like a blazing meteor at the time of the dissolution of the world."
Yuddha Kanda,102,59,"That spear, hurled by Rama, fell on that Ravana's spear. Torn down by Rama's spear, the large spear of Ravana fell on the ground, with its lustre extinguished."
Yuddha Kanda,102,60,"With terrific arrows of high speed, with their shafts made of reeds, going straight to their target, Rama pierced the exceedingly fleet horses of Ravana."
Yuddha Kanda,102,61,"With his sharp arrows, Rama then pierced the chest-region of Ravana. He also struck, quite deliberately, the forehead of Ravana with three arrows."
Yuddha Kanda,102,62,"With all his limbs torn down by arrows and with blood flowing from his limbs, that Ravana in the midst of demons, shone like a blooming Ashoka tree in the midst of a multitude of trees."
Yuddha Kanda,102,63,"With his limbs severely injured by Rama's arrows and with his body bathed in blood, that Ravana felt exhausted in the middle of a multitude of demons and gave went to a violent anger at that time."
Yuddha Kanda,103,1,"Tormented by Rama in fury, that Ravana then for his part, who was boasting of his fight, flew into a great rage."
Yuddha Kanda,103,2,"Raising his bow, his eyes blazing with anger, extremely enraged as he was with Rama in that great battle, the valiant Ravana of prowess continued to oppress, by covering Rama with thousands of streams of arrows, as a rainy cloud would fill a pond with thousands of arrow-like torrents from the sky."
Yuddha Kanda,103,3,"Covered by a multitude of arrows discharged from Ravana's bow in battle, Rama did not wince, like a large mountain which was unshakable."
Yuddha Kanda,103,4,The valiant Rama stood interrupting the torrents of arrows with his own arrows in the battle-field and endured them as rays of the sun.
Yuddha Kanda,103,5,"Then, the enraged Ravana of brisk hand, struck thousands of arrows into the breast of the great-souled Rama."
Yuddha Kanda,103,6,"Rama, bathed in blood in the battle-field, appeared like a very big Kimshuka tree with bloom in a forest."
Yuddha Kanda,103,7,"Enraged at the impact of the arrows, that Rama of very great splendour , took hold of arrows which shone like the sun at the time of dissolution of the world."
Yuddha Kanda,103,8,"Both Rama and Ravana who were see each other at that time in the battle-field, which was shrouded in darkness by the arrows."
Yuddha Kanda,103,9,"Bursting into laughter, though filled with anger, the valiant Rama, the son of Dasaratha spoke the following harsh words to Ravana."
Yuddha Kanda,103,10,"""O the worst of demons! Since you took away my helpless wife without my notice from Janasthana, hence you are not a person of prowess."""
Yuddha Kanda,103,11,"""Having taken away by force the miserable Seetha while she was staying in the forest away from me, you think: ï¿½I am a champion'."""

Yuddha Kanda,103,16,"""O evil-minded one! You think: ï¿½I am a champion' yourself! Shame did not stand in your way at all, for having taken away Seetha like a thief."""
Yuddha Kanda,103,17,"""If Seetha were laid hands upon by you in my presence, you would have surely seen your brother Khara at that very moment when killed with my arrows."""

Yuddha Kanda,103,21,"""Let birds (such as crows and vultures) tear out your bowels, as eagles would drag serpents when you fall down dead when pierced by my arrows today."""
Yuddha Kanda,103,22,"Thus speaking, the valiant Rama, the annihilator of enemies, poured out streams of arrows on Ravana, who was in the vicinity."
Yuddha Kanda,103,23,"The prowess, the strength, the enthusiasm and the stamina of arms of Rama became two-fold, when he longed for the death of his enemy in battle."
Yuddha Kanda,103,24,"All kinds of mystic missiles came to light in the mind of Rama the learned self and in his excessive enthusiasm, Rama of extra-ordinary energy became all the more swift-handed."
Yuddha Kanda,103,25,"Recognizing those good omens, Rama, the destroyer of demons, tormented Ravana even more vehemently."
Yuddha Kanda,103,26,"While being struck by volleys of stones hurled by the monkeys and the showers of arrows coming from Rama, Ravana felt bewildered at heart."
Yuddha Kanda,103,27,"Ravana could no longer take up weapons, nor stretch his bow, nor reacted to Rama's prowess - on account of his mind being confused."
Yuddha Kanda,103,28,"As the time of his death approached, the arrows swiftly hurled and the various kinds of missiles employed by Ravana did not turn to be of any use in battle."
Yuddha Kanda,103,29,"Seeing Ravana reduced to such a plight, the charioteer driving the chariot, for his part, without getting excited, calmly and slowly carried off his chariot away from the battle-front."
Yuddha Kanda,103,30,"On seeing Ravana, the king sunk down; hopelessly bereft of energy, the charioteer diverting in haste the chariot of Ravana, which was rumbling like a cloud, thereupon sneaked away from the battle-field in dismay."
Yuddha Kanda,104,1,"Impelled by force of Destiny and with his red-blood eyes through anger due to infatuation, that Ravana spoke to his charioteer as follows:"
Yuddha Kanda,104,2,"""O evil-minded fellow! Despising me as though I were bereft of manliness, incapable, deficient in prowess, cowardly, petty-minded, devoid of energy, bereft of brilliance, deserted of conjuring tricks and abandoned by mystic missiles, you are acting as per your discretion!"""
Yuddha Kanda,104,3,"""Why have you carried away this chariot of mine, thus humiliating me in the presence of my enemies and overlooking my will?"""

Yuddha Kanda,104,9,"Hearing those harsh words of the foolish Ravana, the friendly-minded charioteer spoke the following conciliatory words of Ravana:"
Yuddha Kanda,104,10,"""I was neither frightened nor I was stupid. I was not bribed by the enemies, nor was I a blunderer. I was not disloyal to you. I have not forgotten the benefits conferred by you."""

Yuddha Kanda,104,23,"Satisfied with the explanation given by his charioteer and applauding him in many ways, Ravana who was avaricious of fighting, spoke the following words:"

Yuddha Kanda,104,25,"Thus speaking Ravna the lord of demons was pleased and then presented a beautiful and excellent ornament for the hand to him. That charioteer, after hearing Ravana's instruction,s drove the chariot back to the battle-field."

Yuddha Kanda,105,24,"""You will be able to kill Ravana at this very moment, O mighty armed one!"" Saying so, the sage, Agastya, thereupon, left as in the same way as he had come."
Yuddha Kanda,105,25,"Hearing this, Rama of extra ordinary energy, then became bereft of anguish. Feeling greatly delighted, Rama retained that hymn in his memory with a devoted mind."
Yuddha Kanda,105,26,"Sipping the water thrice and getting purified looking intently on the orb of the sun and repeating this prayer, the valiant Rama obtained a great rejoice. Seizing hold of his bow and seeing Ravana, Rama felt delighted in mind and marched forward for the fight. He stood voed to kill Ravana, with an intense and all-sided effort."
Yuddha Kanda,105,27,"Seeing Rama with a delighted mind, and becoming most exhildrated on foreseeing the death of Ravana, the sun-god, standing in the middle of a troop of celestials, exclaimed, ""Hasten up."""
Yuddha Kanda,106,1,"Thrilling with rapture, that charioteer, the charioteer of Ravana, drove forward quickly, his chariot, a chariot, which was capable of attacking the army of enemies, a wonderful piece of art like Gandharva-city, an imaginary city in the sky, mounted with flags, yoked with horses of excellent quality adorned with golden necklaces, filled with war-implements, adorned with rows of flags and banners, which was devouring the sky as it were, making the earth resound, which was the destroyer of the army of adversaries and caused delight to its own."
Yuddha Kanda,106,2,"Rama saw that Ravana's chariot, which was coming speedily with a noise, bearing a large flag-staff, yoked with black horses, endowed with a terrific luster, blazing like an aerial car in the sky, with a luster of the sun, filled with lightning-like flags and with a beautiful appearance of a rain-bow."
Yuddha Kanda,106,3,"Seeing that chariot, releasing streams of arrows, like a cloud releasing streams of rain, with a noise equal to that of a bursting mountain, struck with a diamond, Rama after stretching his bow in a crescent shape, spoke to Matali, Indra's charioteer as follows:"
Yuddha Kanda,106,4,"""O Matali! From the way in which the enemy is marching forward from left to right with a great speed in his chariot more, it appears that heart has been set by him upon destroying himself in the battle."""
Yuddha Kanda,106,5,"""Therefore, take care and march forward, facing the chariot of the enemy I wish to destroy it, even as the wind would blow a cloud."""
Yuddha Kanda,106,6,"""Without fear and flurry and with a steady heart and vision, and the movement of the reins fully controlled, drive the chariot swiftly."""
Yuddha Kanda,106,7,"""You need not be instructed by me, accustomed as you are to drive the chariot of Indra the lord of celestials. Keen as I am to fight with a close attention, I am just reminding you and not teaching you."""
Yuddha Kanda,106,8,"Extremely gratified with those words of Rama, that Matali the excellent charioteer of gods drove on the chariot."
Yuddha Kanda,106,9,"Passing the huge chariot of Ravana on the right, the charioteer then set Ravana shaking, by the dust risen from the wheels of his own chariot."
Yuddha Kanda,106,10,"The enraged Ravana then, with his coppery eyes wide open, trembled Rama, who stood facing his chariot, with arrows."
Yuddha Kanda,106,11,"Meeting fortitude with anger, though provoked with assault, Rama took hold of Indra's bow, which was possessed of extra ordinary impulse in the battle-field."
Yuddha Kanda,106,12,"He also seized hold of arrows of exceeding swiftness, which were shining like sun-beams. Then began that great battle between the two warriors (Rama and Ravana) who were desirous of killing each other, while facing each other like two proud lions."
Yuddha Kanda,106,13,"Then, the gods along with the Gandharvas the celestial musicians, Siddhas the demigods and great sages, desirous of Ravana's ruin, arrived to see the battle of both the chariot-warrriors."
Yuddha Kanda,106,14,"Thereupon, terrific portents that caused one's hair to stand on end, appeared giving an augury of doom to Ravana and prosperity to Rama."
Yuddha Kanda,106,15,"The god of rains poured blood on Ravana's chariot. Horrible winds blew from right to left, forming circles."
Yuddha Kanda,106,16,"A large flock of vultures, roaming about in the sky, was flying forward in the same direction in which Ravana's chariot was going."
Yuddha Kanda,106,17,"Lanka was overcast with dusk, resembling a (red) Japa flower. The land in Lanka, as also the day appeared as if they were blazing."
Yuddha Kanda,106,18,"Large meteors, along with lightnings fell with great noise. Those entities, inimical to Ravana, made demons to lament."
Yuddha Kanda,106,19,"The earth on which Ravana was there, trembled. The arms of fighting demons looked as if they were clasped."
Yuddha Kanda,106,20,"Fallen before Ravana, the rays of the sun appeared coppery, yellow, white and dark, like mineral ores on a mountain."
Yuddha Kanda,106,21,"The she-jackals followed by vultures hastily uttered inauspicious howls, on beholding Ravana's face as also vomiting fire from their mouths."
Yuddha Kanda,106,22,"Scattering the dust upwards over the battle-field and clouding the vision of that Ravana, the wind blew in a direction inimicable to him."
Yuddha Kanda,106,23,"Even without the appearance of clouds, thunderbolts fell on his army on all sides, with a noise which was hard to endure."
Yuddha Kanda,106,24,"All the quarters and intermediate points of the compass became covered with darkness and due to outpourings of dust, the sky became difficult to be seen."
Yuddha Kanda,106,25,"Hundreds of dreadful Sarika* birds, with their awful howls, terribly fighting there, fell down upon Ravana's chariot."
Yuddha Kanda,106,26,"His horses discharged sparks of fire from their hips and loins as also tears from their eyes, releasing out fire and water at the same time continuously."
Yuddha Kanda,106,27,"Frightful portents in multitude thus sprang up, bringing danger and destruction to Ravana."
Yuddha Kanda,106,28,"Pleasant and auspicious omens, depicting victory of Rama appeared on all sides, before Rama."
Yuddha Kanda,106,29,"Seeing the pleasant omens depicting his victory, Rama was very much pleased and considered Ravana as (already) dead."
Yuddha Kanda,106,30,"Then Rama, with the knowledge of all omens, having seen those portents in his own way in the battle-field, obtained rejoice as well as extreme happiness and shown enhanced prowess in combat."
Yuddha Kanda,107,1,"Then ensued a fierce and a prolonged chariot-duel between Rama and Ravana, which was frightful to all the worlds."
Yuddha Kanda,107,2,"Then, the army of demons and the huge army of mokeys, stood motionless with their weapons held fast in their hands."
Yuddha Kanda,107,3,"Having their hearts captivated in seeing those two warriors, a human being and a demon, both in full strength engaged in a fight, all for their part experienced a great wonder."
Yuddha Kanda,107,4,"Having their hands occupied with various kinds of weapons, all those warriors stood amazed in mind in beholding that duel. They did not go for war on each other."
Yuddha Kanda,107,5,The demons beholding Ravana and the army of monkeys seeing Rama with their eyes in amazement appeared as though they were paintings.
Yuddha Kanda,107,6,"Having made up their minds and being firm in their anger, those two warriors for their part, Rama and Ravana fought fearlessly, as it were, on seeing the portents in the battle."
Yuddha Kanda,107,7,"Rama, who was convinced that he was going to win and Ravana who was firmly persuaded that he would die, then demonstrated the entire wealth of their prowess in battle on that occasion."
Yuddha Kanda,107,8,"Thereupon, the valiant Ravana, fitting his arrows with anger, released them, directing them towards the flag-staff fixed on Rama's chariot."
Yuddha Kanda,107,9,"Without even reaching the ensign on Indra's chariot and touching off the staff which supported the banner of the chariot, the arrows fell on the ground."
Yuddha Kanda,107,10,"Thereafter, the valiant Rama too, in great anger, stretching his bow, proceeded with his mind, to return blow for blow."
Yuddha Kanda,107,11,"Rama released a sharp arrow, looking like a huge serpent and which was unbearable, as though blazing with its own splendour, directing towards Ravana's flag-staff."
Yuddha Kanda,107,12,"As the brilliant Rama released the arrow towards the flag-staff, that arrow, tearing asunder Ravana's flag-staf, entered the earth."
Yuddha Kanda,107,13,"That standard, mounted on Ravana's chariot, having been torn off, fell on the ground. Seeing the thrown-down piece of his flag-staff, that mighty Ravana stood blazing as though he was laughing with intolerance. Flaming up with anger, he showered a stream of arrows afflicted as he was, with the power of wrath."
Yuddha Kanda,107,14,Ravana struck Rama's horses with blazing arrows. Those divine horses were neither shaken nor stumbled in the battle-field. They were indeed healthy at heart and felt as though they were just struck with lotus-stalks.
Yuddha Kanda,107,15,"Seeing those horses unstumbled, Ravana then was very much enraged and released showers of arrows."
Yuddha Kanda,107,16,"He also hurled maces, iron bludgeons, discs, iron clubs, mountain-tops, trees, spikes and axes."
Yuddha Kanda,107,17,"Unwearied as he was in his heart and in effort, Ravana then employed streams of missiles as a creation of magic and also thousands of arrows."
Yuddha Kanda,107,18,"In that battle, abundant rain of various missiles, which were tumultuous, generating fear, terrific and attended with a terrible echo, descended."
Yuddha Kanda,107,19,"Leaving alone Rama's chariot, Ravana released arrows on the army of monkeys on all sides, thus wholly covering the sky."
Yuddha Kanda,107,20,"Ravana released arrows with a mind, which had given up all hope of survival. Seeing that Ravana, who was interested in the battle, putting forth his great effort, Rama fitted Sharp arrows to his bow, as though laughing and thereupon he loosed the arrows in hundreds and thousands."
Yuddha Kanda,107,21,"Seeing those arrows, Ravana completely covered the sky with his own arrows. Due to that dazzling shower of arrows then employed by the two warriors, the shining sky looked like a second sky built with arrows."
Yuddha Kanda,107,22,"While Rama and Ravana were discharging the arrows thus in the battle0field, no arrow missed the target, no one failed to pierce the target and none had gone in vain. Colliding with each other, they fell on the ground."
Yuddha Kanda,107,23,"Releasing the arrows left and right continually, they fought at each other. With their terrific arrows, they made the sky, bereft of even a breathing space."
Yuddha Kanda,107,24,"Rama struck Ravana's horses. Ravana struck Rama's horses. Both the warriors then struck at each other, doing anything before and after."
Yuddha Kanda,107,25,"Those two extremely enraged warriors in this way, carried out are excellent combat. A tumultuous battle ensued for an hour or so, causing the hair to stand erect."
Yuddha Kanda,107,26,"The mighty Ravana and Rama carried out the fight well with sharp arrows in the battle-field. That Ravana at that time was very much enraged with Rama, as his flag-staff was thrown down."
Yuddha Kanda,107,27,"All the created beings for their part gazed with an astonished mind on Rama and Ravana, who thus were fighting at each other in the battle-field."
Yuddha Kanda,107,28,"Furiously attacking each other in the battle-field, those excellent chariots of the two warriors ran towards each other."
Yuddha Kanda,107,29,"Intent on destroying each other, those chariots, displaying various types of movements such as, moving in circles, moving straight and darting forward as also receding forthwith, originated from the capabilities of those charioteers, assumed a terrible aspect."
Yuddha Kanda,107,30,"Rama wounding Ravana and Ravana too wounding Rama, both of them had recourse to speed in movement in their forward and backward motions."
Yuddha Kanda,107,31,"Those excellent chariots, casting streams of arrows, strolled in the battle-field, like two clouds pouring showers."
Yuddha Kanda,107,32,"Showing various kinds of movement in the battle-field, those chariots then again stood facing each other."
Yuddha Kanda,107,33,"The shaft of the two chariots even as they stood at that moment, met one with the other shaft the muzzle of the horses met the one with the other and the flags met the one with the other flags."
Yuddha Kanda,107,34,"Then Rama, with his four sharp arrows discharged from his bow, drove back the four splendid horses of Ravana."
Yuddha Kanda,107,35,"That Ravana, falling a prey to anger for retreating his horses, discharged sharp arrows on Rama."
Yuddha Kanda,107,36,"Rama, who was severely struck by the mighty Ravana, did not get upset nor was even tottered."
Yuddha Kanda,107,37,"Directing towards Matali, Indra's charioteer, Ravana hurled arrows with a sound similar to that of a thunder-bolt."
Yuddha Kanda,107,38,"Arrows of great speed, fallen on Matali's body, did not cause even a pretty little of bewilderment or hurt on him in that battle."
Yuddha Kanda,107,39,"Enraged at that daring attack on Matali, Rama who for his part did not feel provoked by the attack on himself, made his enemy turn away by hurling a net work of arrows on him."
Yuddha Kanda,107,40,"The valiant Rama discharged twenty, thirty, sixty and hundreds and thousands of arrows on the enemy's chariot."
Yuddha Kanda,107,41,"Thereupon, even Ravana, the enraged king of demons, who was seated in the chariot, tormented Rama, by showering maces and mallets on him in the battle."
Yuddha Kanda,107,42,"The battle thus started again by then, was tumultuous, causing one's hair to stand erect. With the sounds of maces, mallets and iron rods and with the gusts raised by the plumes adorning the flying arrows, the seven agitated oceans felt disquieted."
Yuddha Kanda,107,43,"Thousands of all the demons and serpents, inhabiting in the nethermost subterranean region of the agitated oceans, felt disturbed."
Yuddha Kanda,107,44,"The entire earth, including mountains, groves and forests trembled. The sun too became gloomy even the wind did not blow."
Yuddha Kanda,107,45,"Then, the gods along with Gandharvas the celestial musicians, Siddhas the semi-divine beings, great sages and all including Kinnaras the mythical beings and great serpents became disquieted."
Yuddha Kanda,107,46,"At that time, those gods along with troops of sages, saying ""May all be well with the cows and Brahmanas, May all the worlds endure forever, May Rama conquer Ravana!"", saw a terrific battle between Rama and Ravana, which caused one's hair to stand on end."
Yuddha Kanda,107,47,"Seeing that matchless struggle and observing that the sky is its own compeer and the ocean is its own analogue, the battle between Rama and Ravana can be likened only to the battle between Rama and Ravana, the hosts of Gandharvas the celestial musicians and Apsaras, the heavenly lymphs, looked on that battle between Rama and Ravana."
Yuddha Kanda,107,48,"Thereupon, the great-armed Rama who augmented the fame of the kings born in Raghu dynasty, stretching with anger, the serpent-like arrow with his bow, chopped off the glorious head of Ravana, which was graced with blazing ear-rings. Then, all the three worlds saw that head, fallen on the ground."
Yuddha Kanda,107,49,"Another head, exactly similar to that head, cropped up on the shoulders of Ravana. That second head was again chopped off by Rama, possessing a swift hand and who was swift in his act."
Yuddha Kanda,107,50,"The second head of Ravana was cut off by arrows in that battle. Soon after that head was chopped off, it again rose into view."
Yuddha Kanda,107,51,"Rama chopped off that head too with his arrows looking like thunderbolts. In the same manner, a hundred of Ravana's heads of equal splendour were chopped off by Rama."
Yuddha Kanda,107,52,"Yet, no certainty about Ravana's death could be seen. Thought equipped with many arrows and well-versed with all kinds of missiles, the valiant Rama, the augmentor of Kausalya's joy, then became thoughtful (said to himself as follows):"
Yuddha Kanda,107,53,"""What is the reason, these arrows by which Mareecha, Khara, Dushana, Kabandha in Kroucha-forest, and Viradha in Dandaka-forest were killed, by which seven Sala trees and the mountains were burst, by which Vali was killed and the ocean shaken up all these arrows which provided immediate succour to me in battle, have proved of little efficacy in the case of Ravana."""
Yuddha Kanda,107,54,"Thus absorbed in thought, Rama remained vigilant in the battle-field. He showered streams of arrows in Ravana's chest."
Yuddha Kanda,107,55,"Thereupon, even Ravana, the enraged king of demons, who was seated in his chariot, tormented Rama by showering maces and mallets on him in the combat."
Yuddha Kanda,107,56,"That great tumultuous battle, which caused one's hair to stand on end, took place in the sky, on the ground and furthermore on the mountain."
Yuddha Kanda,107,57,"While the gods, the demons, Yakshas the super-natural beings, the devils, the serpents and the ogres were witnessing, that great battle occurred for seven days."
Yuddha Kanda,107,58,"There was no respite in battle between Rama and Ravana, either in the might or in the day-time or for an hour or even for a instant."
Yuddha Kanda,107,59,"Not beholding the victory of Rama in the combat between Rama and Ravana that great-souled Matali, the charioteer of Indra quickly spoke the following words to Rama, who was still engaged in fighting."
Yuddha Kanda,108,1,"Thereupon, Matali refreshed the memory of Rama as follows: ""O the valiant one! Why are you still carrying out the battle with Ravana as though you are unaware (of how to dispose of him)?"
Yuddha Kanda,108,2,"""O lord! You can employ a mystic missile presided over by Brahma the lord of creation. The time for his destruction has come now, as expressed by the celestials."""
Yuddha Kanda,108,3,"Then, the valiant Rama, who was reminded thus by Matali, took hold of a blazing arrow, which was given by Brahma and which in turn was given to him by the glorious sage, Agastya earlier in the battle-field and which looked like a hissing serpent."
Yuddha Kanda,108,4,"Having been made formerly for Indra, the lord of celestials by Brahma, the lord of creation of infinite strength, it was bestowed in the past on the ruler of gods, who was desirous of conquering the three worlds."
Yuddha Kanda,108,5,"In its feathers, wind was established. In its end-point were the fire and the sun. In its heaviness were Mounts Meru and Mandara. Its shaft was made of ether."
Yuddha Kanda,108,6,"Provided with good shaft decked with gold, the arrow which had its body shining, had been made up of the efficacy of all the elements and an illuminating power of the sun."
Yuddha Kanda,108,7,"Blazing like a fire at the time of universal dissolution enveloped in smoke and looking like a venomous snake, it was swift in action and capable of bursting hosts of men, elephants and horses."
Yuddha Kanda,108,8,"It broke gate-ways, iron bars, and even mountains. Smeared witht he blood of various victims and quoted with their marrow, it presented a very terrific appearance."
Yuddha Kanda,108,9,"That arrow had an efficacy of a thunder bolt, loud-sounding, tearing off armies of adversaries in many battles and creating fear to all, like a hissing serpent."
Yuddha Kanda,108,10,"It was giving perennial feed to vultures, eagles, cranes, troops of jackals and demons in the battle-field, possessing a form of Yama the lord of Death and was fearful."
Yuddha Kanda,108,11,"That arrow bestowed joy on the monkey-leaders and destroyed the demons. It was made speedy, by tying various kinds of beautiful coloured feathers of Garuda, the king of eagles, to it."
Yuddha Kanda,108,12,"Making it sacred by a special formula as per the procedure specified in scriptures, Rama who was endowed with an extraordinary strength then fixed that arrow which was the foremost among the three worlds, capable of removing the fear of Ikshwaku dynasty, taking away the glory of the enemies and bestowing joy to one's own self on his bow."
Yuddha Kanda,108,13,"While that excellent arrow was being fixed by Rama, all the beings were frightened and the earth trembled."
Yuddha Kanda,108,14,"That enraged Rama, stretching his bow well and with an attentive mind, hurled that arrow which can tear off the vitals, towards Ravana."
Yuddha Kanda,108,15,"That arrow, which was inviolable as a thunderbolt hurled by the arms of Indra and irresistible as Yama the lord of Death, fell upon Ravana's chest."
Yuddha Kanda,108,16,"That arrow, released with great speed and which was capable of destroying the body, tore off the heart of that evil-minded Ravana."
Yuddha Kanda,108,17,"That arrow, which was capable of causing death to the body, after taking away the life of Ravana and having been anointed with blood, penetrated the earth."
Yuddha Kanda,108,18,"Smeared with blood on having killed Ravana and thereby accomplishing its mission, that arrow re-entered its own quiver (of Rama) silently."
Yuddha Kanda,108,19,"From the hands of the slain Ravana, who was being separated from his life, fell his bow with its arrows (fitted to it), at the same time coinciding indeed with his life-breath."
Yuddha Kanda,108,20,"Having lost his life, that king of demons for his part, who was endowed with terrible swiftness and invested with great splendour, fell down from the chariot to the ground , like Vritra the demon when the latter was struck down by the thunderbolt."
Yuddha Kanda,108,21,"Seeing Ravana fallen down on earth, the surviving demons whose king had been killed, were panic stricken and ran away to all sides."
Yuddha Kanda,108,22,"The monkeys, who fought with trees, fell upon the demons from all sides. Seeing the killing of Rvana, the monkeys assumed a triumphant appearance."
Yuddha Kanda,108,23,"Tormented by the monkeys, the demons rushed back with panic towards Lanka, with faces looking miserable and tears flowing down, their supporter having been killed."
Yuddha Kanda,108,24,"Roaring shouts of joy, quite rejoiced as they were, and proclaiming Rama's victory and the killing of Ravana in his hands, the monkeys behaved like conquerors."
Yuddha Kanda,108,25,"Then the cheerful kettle-drum of the gods reverberated in the sky. Very pleasant winds, carrying divine odour, blew there."
Yuddha Kanda,108,26,"Pouring over the chariot of Rama quite fascinating shower of flowers, which was difficult to be accomplished (elsewhere), fell from the heavens to the earth on that occasion."
Yuddha Kanda,108,27,"Excellent pronouncements of the great-souled gods saying ""well done! Bravo!"", combined with a panegyric in praise of Rama, was distinctly heard in the sky."
Yuddha Kanda,108,28,"When Ravana, the cruel demon and the terror of all the worlds, was killed, a great rejoice filled the hearts of gods and charanas the celestial bards."
Yuddha Kanda,108,29,"Having been pleased with the killing of Ravana, Rama then fulfilled the desire of Sugreeva, Angada and Vibhishana."
Yuddha Kanda,108,30,"Then, troops of celestials got their mental peace. All the quarters were brightened up and the sky became clear. The earth did not tremble. The wind blew gently. The sun too shed a steady light."
Yuddha Kanda,108,31,"Rejoiced with the victory in battle, Sugreeva, Vibhishana and Angada together with Lakshmana along with their friends paid their respects with due ceremony to Rama, who looked charming."
Yuddha Kanda,108,32,"That Rama, the delight of Dasaratha, for his part, who had just killed his enemy and thus who was steadfast in his vows and who was endowed with a great splendour, who stood surrounded on the battle-field by his own people and the army shone like Indra the lord of celestials."
Yuddha Kanda,109,1,"Seeing his brother lying down dead after defeat in battle, Vibhishana lamented, with his mind filled with an outburst of sorrow:"
